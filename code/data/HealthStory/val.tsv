"En Español  By Steven Reinberg  HealthDay Reporter  SUNDAY, March 6, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- A simple blood test may one day offer a safe way to detect Down syndrome during pregnancy, researchers say.  In a small study, an experimental blood test identified a gene mutation associated with Down syndrome with 100 percent accuracy, according to the Cyprus scientists.  ""Down syndrome is a common birth defect, with one Down syndrome birth in every 600 births in all populations,"" said lead researcher Philippos Patsalis, chief executive medical director of the Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics in Nicosia. ""This is due to an extra chromosome 21, and that leads to physical and mental impairment.""  ""With our method we identify all normal and all Down syndrome [pregnancies],"" Patsalis said.  Currently, Down syndrome is diagnosed using one of two invasive procedures, amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. Because these tests, while 80 percent accurate, carry a 1 percent to 2 percent risk of miscarriage, only about one in 10 pregnant women opts for them, he said.  The new test eliminates the risk of miscarriage, Patsalis said.  It also can identify Down syndrome in the 11th week of pregnancy, early enough for a woman to end her pregnancy if she chooses, Patsalis said.  Although Down syndrome varies in severity, it usually causes some intellectual impairment and distinguishing facial features. Heart defects and other health problems are also common, according to the March of Dimes. Older mothers are more likely to give birth to Down syndrome babies.  People with Down syndrome, also known as Trisomy 21, carry three copies of chromosome 21, instead of two.  For the study, published online March 6 in Nature Medicine, Patsalis and his colleagues took blood samples from pregnant women and mothers of Down syndrome and healthy babies. In each case, the test quickly pinpointed the chromosomal variation, identifying 14 Down syndrome cases and 26 normal fetuses, the study authors said.  If larger clinical trials confirm the results, the test could become standard practice, Patsalis said. ""The cost is much lower than the invasive procedures,"" he said. ""We estimate we can introduce this to clinical practice in a couple of years.""  Dr. Brian Skotko, clinical fellow in genetics at Children's Hospital Boston and a spokesman for the National Down Syndrome Society, said this study has widespread implications for the incidence of Down syndrome.  With this new test, women will know if their baby has Down syndrome even before they look pregnant, Skotko said. ""So they will be able to make a very personal decision without anyone realizing it,"" he said.  Noting that most of his Down syndrome patients say they lead fulfilling lives, Skotko said, ""The overwhelming majority of family members say they can't imagine their life without their family member with Down syndrome.""

"March 21, 2011 -- Long-term results for Lap-Band weight loss surgery are relatively poor, according to a new study from Belgium.  But a spokesman for the company that manufactures Lap-Band says the study is flawed.  Nearly half of the 82 patients followed for 12 years or longer required removal of the bands and about 40% had major complications, the researchers found. The average weight loss was below what experts consider good results. Even so, a majority of the patients in their small study said they were satisfied with the procedure.  Despite that degree of satisfaction, ""I think people have exaggerated expectations from the band procedure,"" says researcher Jacques Himpens, MD, an attending surgeon at St. Pierre University Hospital in Brussels. His study findings, he tells WebMD, are ''a reality call.""  But some, including the manufacturer of the Lap-Band -- used in a technique called laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding -- take exception to the study, criticizing the small sample size and the number of patients lost to follow-up.  The critics also point out that both the device itself and the expertise of surgeons placing it have improved greatly since the patients in the study had their bands placed, in the years 1994 through 1997.  But Himpens tells WebMD he's skeptical either would make much difference. ""My impression is, even with the newer band, the results are not significantly better,"" he says.  He emphasizes he is not against the use of gastric band surgery, but that based on his study results, patients who opt for the procedure should know there's a good chance they will need a follow-up procedure and they may have less weight loss and more complications than those who choose other weight loss surgeries."	0
"Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Rutgers University studied 408 males from adolescence to their mid-30s. The participants fell into four groups: those with no use or low use of marijuana, early chronic users, those who only smoked during their teens and those who began using it later and continued using the drug. The early chronic users smoked a great deal -- a peak of more than 200 days per year on average when they were 22 years old.  AD  AD  The researchers found no links to physical or mental health issues -- including depression, psychotic symptoms or asthma -- in any group, even those with very high use. They controlled for cigarette smoking, other drug use, access to health insurance and other factors.  ""What we found was a little surprising,"" lead author Jordan Bechtold, a research fellow at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said in a statement.  Based on other studies in the past that seemed to allude to marijuana use and later development of psychotic symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations, the researchers had thought they might find some associations to disease or other health conditions. But there were none.  AD  They also found no link to a wide range of other health issues: cancer, asthma, respiratory problems, depression, anxiety, allergies, headaches or high blood pressure.  AD  Bechtold said the researchers wanted to ""help inform the debate about legalization of marijuana"" but that this is a very complicated issue and one, study, including his own, should not be taken in isolation and should be viewed in context of other studies on teenagers' marijuana use.  One major limitation of the study is that it ends when the men are in their 30s ""which may be too early for decrements in health to emerge,"" the authors acknowledge. ""Therefore, continued data collection and longer follow-ups are needed.""  AD  Update: The study's findings generated significant controversy along with requests for supplemental analysis, according to the editors of the Psychology of Addictive Behaviors. In a lengthy clarification issued in December 2015, the journal said that by applying different models to look at the data they confirmed that there did not appear to be any link between marijuana use and health issues. However, the reanalysis regarding psychotic disorders contradicted the earlier conclusions -- that there indeed appeared to be a higher risk of psychotic disorders among marijuana users in the study versus non-users that approached statistical significance when using a more liberal test.

An inhaler that protects the lungs against air pollution has been developed by scientists and could help the many millions of people affected by toxic air to avoid its worst effects.  The inhaler delivers a molecule, first found in bacteria in the Egyptian desert, which stabilises water on the surface of the lung cells to form a protective layer. It is expected to be available as an inexpensive, over-the-counter product.  Outdoor air pollution is a global health crisis that kills over 3 million people a year and it has long been linked to lung and heart disease and strokes. But research is also uncovering new impacts on health, including degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer’s, mental illness and, this week, diabetes.  The impact of air pollution costs $5tn a year, according to a World Bank report published last week. In the UK, at least 40,000 people a year die prematurely from air pollution, with a cross-party committee of MPs calling it a “public health emergency”.  But the government’s plans to tackle the issue were heavily criticised this week, just as alerts were issued for extreme air pollution across much of northern England. A day later, it was announced that more ambitious plans for London from Mayor Sadiq Khan were overwhelmingly backed by the public.  Vehicles are a key contributor to air pollution but, a year after the VW emissions scandal broke, most new diesel cars still emit far more toxic nitrogen oxides on the road than the official lab-based limit.  Action to clean up air is urgently needed across the world, but cutting emissions for vehicles and other sources will take years, meaning ways to reduce the harm in the meantime could be vital. The new inhaler has been developed by German medical devices company Bitop and is based on a molecule called ectoine, discovered in the 1980s in a desert bacterium which uses the compound to conserve water in 60C heat.  “It is quite an inert molecule that does one main thing, which is bind water, which stabilises cell membrane tissues against physical or chemical damage,” said Dr Andreas Bilstein, at Bitop. “It supports the natural barrier.”  When inhaled, this helps prevent the damage caused by air pollution particles that can lead to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer, Bilstein said: “Damage cannot occur as strongly and there is less inflammatory response, and so disease progression is reduced. The perfect situation is that the patient inhales in the morning and evening at home.”  The inhaler has been tested in three small groups of patients particularly at risk from air pollution, due to asthma, COPD and bronchitis, with the positive results due to be published soon, Bilstein said.  Ectoine does not interact with cell receptors, so it is classed as a medical device rather than a drug. This means large clinical trials are not required for official approval and the inhaler could be on sale soon, at an estimated cost of £17 a month, after Bitop selects a marketing partner. A version of the product for use in nebulisers will be available this year in Germany and Poland, while an ectoine-based nasal spray for allergy relief is already available.  Bilstein said the inhaler could be useful around the world, as particulate air pollution is not just a European problem: “Especially in Asia – China in particular – the demand for such a product is even higher. I was in New York last week, and the air was also not very clean.”  The protective effect of ectoine was discovered by Prof Jean Krutmann and colleagues at the Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine, while investigating whether the molecule could protect skin against sun damage. Bitop funded a series of studies, now published in prominent scientific journals.  “The point that it can prevent the lung inflammation induced by ultrafine particles is established – there is no more doubt,” Krutmann said. Antioxidants can also provide some protection but there has been controversy over the effectiveness of such food supplements, he said: “Personally, I think it is much better to eat lots of vegetables and fruit rather than taking any supplements.”  Dr Richard Russell, a consultant respiratory physician in the NHS and medical advisor to the British Lung Foundation, who was not involved in the research, said the inhaler was both credible and promising: “Ectoine is a beautifully elegant molecule and it clearly works by helping water to stabilise, giving you a film of water in times of stress.”  “The work that has been published thus far, in credible, internationally recognised journals, show that this stuff has positive properties, protecting against triggered inflammation,” he told the Guardian. Russell, who also lectures at Imperial College and Oxford University, said it might also be useful for the treatment of asthma, COPD and other lung diseases, not only prevention. “It could potentially do so much more. It is actually quite exciting and there is clearly	0
"Before Starting A Statin, Talk It Over With Your Doctor  Enlarge this image toggle caption Visuals Unlimited/Getty Images/Visuals Unlimited Visuals Unlimited/Getty Images/Visuals Unlimited  A study published Monday is pushing back against the notion that up to 40 percent of Americans should be taking statin drugs to reduce the risk of heart disease. The study, in the Annals of Internal Medicine, argues that current medical guidelines haven't adequately considered the risks from these widely used drugs.  ""Some harms are mentioned, but it's entirely unclear how they were considered when coming up with the recommendations,"" says Milo Puhan, a physician and epidemiologist at the University of Zurich and senior author of the new study. ""In our approach we very explicitly considered the harms.""  It's important to note that statin drugs are generally safe, and harms are uncommon. On the other hand, the benefits aren't that great, either. Anywhere from 50 to 200 healthy people need to take a statin daily to prevent a single heart attack for five years, so even small harms may outweigh the potential benefits, the Swiss scientists say.  The most common side effect of these drugs is muscle pain, which usually goes away if patients stop taking the medicines. People taking statins are also at a higher risk of developing diabetes, which is harder to reverse.  Puhan also found that some statins were more effective than others, with atorvastatin (the generic name for Lipitor) being the best of the bunch. He notes that physician guidelines don't generally compare the relative value of these drugs, which are all available as inexpensive generics.  He also finds that benefits fade compared with harms as people get older. ""The elderly do not benefit as much as previous studies might have thought,"" he says.  ""One size doesn't fit it all,"" he concludes. ""That's a very important message.""  Puhan says, based on his assessment, perhaps 15 to 20 percent of older adults should be taking statins – far less than the 30 or 40 percent suggested by current medical guidelines.  ""I think for me, as a physician,"" says Ilana Richman, an internist at the Yale School of Medicine, ""this kind of data suggests that if we give more weight to the potential for adverse events, then maybe it's reasonable to hold off for lower-risk patients.""  She co-wrote an editorial about the paper and came away from it thinking that doctors need to spend more time talking about the plusses and minuses of statin treatment, personalizing their recommendations more than they do now. She says it's a challenge to convey these sophisticated concepts in the short amount of time doctors have to spend with their patients.  Yet that kind of dialog is increasingly the expectation. In mid-November, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology published new guidelines calling for more nuanced conversations around who would most benefit from statins.  Scott Grundy, a physician at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center who chaired the guidelines committee, says the new recommendations urge people in this gray area to get a special kind of CT scan that looks for calcium deposits in heart arteries, a signal for clogs that could cause trouble.  ""If you have no coronary calcium, then your chances of having a heart attack over the next 10 years are very low,"" he says.  And it turns out that perhaps 40 percent of people who are identified as candidates based on their risk factors such as cholesterol levels and age actually have clear heart arteries, Grundy says. ""That means a lot of people are going to be treated unnecessarily if they don't have the calcium scan.""  But that test, which Grundy says is available for about $100, is controversial among some physicians. They worry that it will trigger overtreatment of conditions that the scan will pick up, but which don't require urgent attention.  And it is only useful as a screening test for people who haven't had heart disease. Statins are routinely prescribed for people who have already had a heart attack or stroke. For those patients (who weren't included in the Swiss analysis), the benefits are so clear ""it's almost mandatory to be on a statin drug,"" Grundy says.  He disagrees with a lot of the particulars in the Swiss study. So does cardiologist Roger Blumenthal, who heads the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at Johns Hopkins. ""The harms [analyzed in the paper] can be dealt with by a smart clinician,"" he says.  Yet both the new guidelines and the latest study agree on an important point: Doctors and patients should spend more time reviewing the benefits and risks of statins, with attention paid to each person's particular circumstances.

LanaLanglois / Featurepics.com Tofu is one soyfood that may help at least some women survive lung cancer better, a study finds  Soy foods, long shown to help lower the risk of cancer, may also help people survive at least some forms of cancer better, researchers reported on Monday.  They found that Chinese women who ate the most soy were also less likely to die of lung cancer, the No. 1 cancer killer across the world.  The findings, published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, lends support to the idea that adding soy foods to the diet can help people in multiple ways, says Dr. Jyoti Patel, a lung cancer specialist at Northwestern University in Chicago, who was not involved in the study.  “It may be that we do need to change our diets a little bit and eat more of these soy-based diets. The benefits may go beyond cardiac health,” Patel said in a telephone interview.  For the study, Gong Yang and colleagues at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Shanghai Cancer Institute, and the National Cancer Institute looked at data from a large study of Chinese women called the Shanghai Women’s Health Study. They pulled out the records of 444 of the women, who had lung cancer.  The women had all filled out questionnaires that included details of what they normally ate. They did this twice – when they enrolled in the study, and two years later.  Of the 444 patients with lung cancer, 318 died during the three years of follow-up, the researchers wrote. “Initial analyses including all patients showed that higher intake of soy food was associated with better overall survival after adjusting for demographic and lifestyle characteristics and other nonclinical factor,” they wrote.  Women who reported eating the least soy were 1.8 times as likely to die, on average. Those who ate the most were about 11 percent less likely to die.  “This finding, along with our previous observation of an approximately 40 percent reduction in risk of incident lung cancer associated with high intake of soy food, provides further support for the role of soy food intake in lung cancer development and prognosis,” the researchers wrote.  Most of the women in the study had never been smokers, and there’s a lot of evidence to suggest that lung cancer is a different disease in smokers versus non-smokers. “In Asian countries, 80 percent of women with lung cancer are never- smokers,” Patel said.  “We don’t know if there is an inherited susceptibility to it,” she added. There might be an infectious disease that causes some cases of lung cancer —like the virus that causes cervical cancer, or the bacteria that causes stomach cancer.  “Although the risks are probably different for American women for developing lung cancer, I do think it is a call to action for more research about how we develop lung cancer,” Patel said. “There are probably 30,000 people in the U.S. who never smoked and who have lung cancer.”  Lung cancer kills 160,000 Americans a year. It’s diagnosed in 110,000 women and 118,000 men a year in the United States alone. It accounts for 27 percent of all cancer deaths, according to the American Cancer Society.  Studies suggest that people who eat the most soy have a lower risk of heart disease and osteoporosis. Women may have fewer menopausal symptoms, and perhaps a lower risk of some cancers.  The Food and Drug Administration says soy products may carry a heart-healthy label saying that soy may reduce cholesterol when eaten as part of a diet that is low in saturated fat and cholesterol.  It wouldn’t be difficult to eat enough soy to be protected, Patel noted. “The high soy level patients were eating what the FDA has said is heart-healthy, or 25 grams of soy a day,’ she said.  Studies have shown that supplements containing soy protein don’t have much health benefit. But foods such as soy milk, tofu and edamame do. “We think that consuming food in their whole forms is more important than the supplements,” Patel said.  Some researchers have wondered whether Western people who eat more soy food are benefiting from the soy itself, or because they perhaps use it as a substitute for meat and dairy foods. Patel says this study in China, where soy is a normal part of the diet and where dairy foods are less commonly eaten, suggests it’s the soy itself that adds the benefit.  Soy and many other plant foods contain hormone-like substances called phytoestrogens. These may be affecting a cell compound called estrogen receptor beta, she said. That compound interacts with another one called epidermal growth factor receptor or EGRF, which is known to play a role in many cases on lung cancer.  “Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death. There are many never-smokers with lung cancer,” she said. “People should consider eating a diet that is healthy. By all accounts one that includes soy decreases cardiac risks and could also affect lung cancer,” Patel concluded.  How can people add soy to their diets?

"By Alan Mozes  HealthDay Reporter  TUESDAY, Dec. 21, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- The recreational drug known as ecstasy may have a medicinal role to play in helping people who have trouble connecting to others socially, new research suggests.  In a study involving a small group of healthy people, investigators found that the drug -- also known as MDMA -- prompted heightened feelings of friendliness, playfulness and love, and induced a lowering of the guard that might have therapeutic uses for improving social interactions.  Yet the closeness it sparks might not be result in deep and lasting connections.  The findings ""suggest that MDMA enhances sociability, but does not necessarily increase empathy,"" noted study author Gillinder Bedi, an assistant professor of clinical psychology at Columbia University and a research scientist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute in New York City.  The study, funded by the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse and conducted at the Human Behavioral Pharmacology Laboratory at the University of Chicago, was published in the Dec. 15 issue of Biological Psychiatry.  In July, another study reported that MDMA might be useful in treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), based on the drug's apparent boosting of the ability to cope with grief by helping to control fears without numbing people emotionally.  MDMA is part of a family of so-called ""club drugs,"" which are popular with some teens and young at all night dances or ""raves."" These drugs, which are often used in combination with alcohol, have potentially life-threatening effects, according to the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse.  The newest study explored the effects of MDMA on 21 healthy volunteers, nine women and 12 men aged 18 to 38. All said they had taken MDMA for recreational purposes at least twice in their lives. They were randomly assigned to take either a low or moderate dose of MDMA, methamphetamine or a sugar pill during four sessions in about a three-week period.  Each session lasted at least 4.5 hours, or until all effects of the drug had worn off. During that time, participants stayed in a laboratory testing room, and social interaction was limited to contact with a research assistant who helped administer cognitive exams.  A moderate dose of MDMA was found to significantly increase feelings of loving, friendliness and playfulness, the researchers said, whereas the low dose of MDMA boosted feelings of loneliness.  The moderate dose also prompted a drop in the ability to accurately recognize fear in other people's faces, determined by having the participants look at a range of photos, the study found, but it did not affect the ability to perceive the shifting cues in a person's eyes or voice, determined by having the participants listen to a series of audio clips.  This effect, the Bedi and his team suggested, could help people improve their social skills by shielding them from the negative emotions of others.  In a twist, the researchers also found that methamphetamine similarly prompted feelings of friendliness and loving. In fact, those who took the drug actually rated themselves as more sociable than those taking MDMA.  As a warning, the researchers noted that MDMA might indeed facilitate socializing, but it also might impair a person's perceptive abilities and thus prompt risk-taking.  Nonetheless, the researchers suggested that MDMA might help people with PTSD as well those with autism, schizophrenia or antisocial personality disorder cope with a variety of emotional difficulties.  ""More controlled research is needed to establish whether MDMA can safely and effectively add to psychotherapy for some conditions and, if so, what the mechanisms of these effects are,"" Bedi said.  Dr. Michael Mithoefer, author of the earlier study on MDMA and PTSD, also urged further exploration of the medicinal potential of the drug.  ""First, I think it's very important that we investigate potential new therapies, and that we shouldn't be dissuaded from doing that just because something can be misused,"" he said. ""Many things can be life-threatening or dangerous if used incorrectly. But if used in the right setting wisely, many things can also be helpful. So there's no question we should be looking into how this might benefit people who are suffering.""  The results of his earlier study, which had focused on the moderate dose of MDMA, ""were very promising,"" Mithoefer said. ""Now, there's a long way to go between that and proving effectiveness. But it certainly suggests, just as these findings suggest, that the question merits further investigation.""  More information  The U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse has more on MDMA."	1
Cognitive behavioural therapy has significant positive effects on a mother’s mental health, income, employment and parenting skills even seven years after the birth of the child, according to the first study of its kind.  The international research project into the impact of depression on pregnant mothers and their babies, led by Professor Sonia Bhalotra from the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex, could have major implications for public policy.  More than 400 million people worldwide report episodes of depression, at a global cost of around £600bn in 2010. Between 12% and 20% of women in the 35 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development suffer from perinatal depression, and 20-35% in poorer countries.  Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy that can help a person manage problems by changing how they think and behave. The NHS website explains that it is “based on the concept that your thoughts, feelings, physical sensations and actions are interconnected, and that negative thoughts and feelings can trap you in a vicious cycle”.  CBT encourages people to see their problems in a more positive way by breaking them down into smaller parts.  While studies have highlighted the short-term benefits of CBT, until now question marks have been raised about whether it can have long-term effects.  The study, one of the largest randomised control trials to be held in the developing world, followed women diagnosed with depression mid-pregnancy in 40 communities in rural Pakistan. Within a year, more than half of the women in a control group (58%) were still depressed, whereas only a quarter of the mothers who had been treated with CBT reported depression.  Returning to the women and their children seven years later, researchers found that the treated mothers were still significantly less likely to be depressed than the control group. The first group were also more likely to be employed and have control over household spending. There were also big improvements in their parenting style.  The study found that women who had least social support such as those who were not living with or near their mother or mother-in-law, benefited most from the therapy intervention, both in the short and long term.  “These findings on the longer-term benefits at seven years post-treatment are really exciting,” Bhalotra said. “This is an important study for the impact on mothers with depression but there are global implications for the treatment of all human beings suffering from depression. We have seen that CBT has changed how many of the treated women live their lives now – their mental health has improved, their financial situation and their empowerment over their lives, and undoubtedly the way they interact with their children.”	1
Any woman who is struggling with infertility will tell you that one of the worst parts of going through in vitro fertilization (IVF) are the daily hormone injections. And for some women, those injections could even be downright dangerous.  Although IVF is still considered the gold standard, there’s an infertility treatment available that is offering hope — in vitro maturation (IVM). IVM has the potential to improve the chances for women to have babies without a long course of hormones.  What is IVM?  IVM is an experimental fertility treatment that collects and matures a woman’s eggs in a lab. Although the treatment is used in conjunction with IVF, the initial process isn’t the same.  With IVF, a woman must undergo between 8 to 11 nights of ovary-stimulating hormone injections before her eggs can be retrieved. With IVM, women undergo a shorter course— between 3 and 6 days— of hormones known as a “priming phase.”  Once the eggs are retrieved, they’re matured in a laboratory for approximately three days, fertilized and then implanted. They can also be frozen as eggs or embryos to be implanted later.  Clinics that specialize in IVM require a doctor who has expertise in retrieving small eggs and a lab with embryologists who have the skills to look for them, said Dr. Janelle Luk, medical director of Neway Fertility in New York City.  Who is IVM helpful for?  Although IVF is considered the standard of care, experts say some women may benefit from IVM.  For starters, since there is less time involved with IVM, women who are undergoing chemotherapy, radiation or plan to have surgery may be good candidates.  IVM may also help women who have a contraindication to the increased levels of estradiol, a form of estrogen, which elevates as the follicles develop and mature. These would include women with an estrogen-sensitive cancer or a history of blood clots.  IVM can also help women who are adverse to injections or who have failed IVF, Luk said.  Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or who are at increased risk for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)— which affects between 3 and 6 percent of women who go through IVF— may also benefit from IVM. OHSS can usually be managed on an outpatient basis but severe OHSS may lead to blood clots, even death, said Dr. Shefali Shastri, a board-certified reproductive endocrinologist and OB/GYN at Reproductive Medicine Associates of New Jersey in Somerset and Short Hills.  More on this... What is ICSI infertility treatment?  What are the limitations of IVM?  A study in the journal Facts, Views and Vision found that IVM achieved up to a 35 percent clinical pregnancy rate in young women, which is comparable to IVF.  Yet most studies have found that IVF is superior to IVM.  Although there are different protocols for IVF, and there aren’t any randomized controlled trials that have compared IVF and IVM side by side, studies that look at standard IVF cycles show a significantly higher pregnancy rate than IVM, Shastri said.  Plus, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) committee opinion on IVM states that implantation rates for IVM—between 5.5 and 21.6 percent— are a more reliable indicator of IVM success and are lower than expected for women of the same age who use IVF. They also note that the technology hasn’t been widely used and that there are no studies looking at the outcomes of birth defects or developmental delays.  Since IVM results in lower fertilization rates, protocols that use IVM are more likely to also use intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), in which one sperm is injected into one egg. Although ICSI is safe and effective, the bigger concern is if a patient going through IVM doesn’t use ICSI, Shastri said.  While IVM is cheaper initially because there are fewer hormones to take, it may be more costly if several rounds are required.  Although IVM may eventually become more common, IVF still remains the standard of care and the most effective way for women to get pregnant.  “With medicine, you always want to optimize a patient’s outcome,” Shastri said. “Ultimately, you want to do the best for the patient so my preference would not be IVM.”	0
"Jan. 25, 2010 -- A low-carbohydrate diet may have health benefits that go beyond weight loss.  A new study shows that a low-carbohydrate diet was equally good as the weight loss drug orlistat (the active ingredient in Alli and Xenical) at helping overweight and obese people lose weight, but people who followed the low-carb diet also experienced a healthy drop in their blood pressure levels.  ""I expected the weight loss to be considerable with both therapies but we were surprised to see blood pressure improve so much more with the low-carbohydrate diet than with orlistat,"" researcher William S. Yancy, Jr., MD, an associate professor of medicine at Duke University Medical Center, says in a news release. ""If people have high blood pressure and a weight problem, a low-carbohydrate diet might be a better option than a weight loss medication.""  Researchers say studies have already shown that the two weight loss methods are effective at promoting weight loss, but it's the first time the health effects of each have been compared head to head.  ""It's important to know you can try a diet instead of medication and get the same weight loss results with fewer costs and potentially fewer side effects,"" Yancy says."	1
Scientists have raised the possibility of using statins – drugs used for reducing cholesterol – to stop some breast cancer tumours returning.  The most common form of breast cancer uses oestrogen to grow. Drugs such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors cut off the supply of oestrogen, reducing the chances that the cancer will return after surgery. But about 12,000 of the 40,000 diagnosed oestrogen-receptor positive (ER-positive) cancers still recur every year.  Study points toward personalised treatment for breast cancer Read more  Early research – most of it still in the lab – published in the journal Breast Cancer Research has shown that some early breast cancer tumours can produce a molecule made from cholesterol called 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC). It can mimic oestrogen and encourage tumours to grow.  Dr Lesley-Ann Martin at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, where the research has been carried out, said: “During the course of treatment, ER-positive breast cancers, that are ‘fed’ by oestrogen, often become resistant to standard hormone therapy. Our research has demonstrated that these cancer cells can use a cholesterol molecule to mimic oestrogen so that they continue to grow without it.  “This is hugely significant. Testing the patient’s tumour for 25-HC or the enzymes that make it may allow us to predict which patients are likely to develop resistance hormone therapy, and tailor their treatment accordingly. Our study also demonstrates that statins could be a valuable addition to breast cancer treatment, and that this warrants investigation in clinical trials.”  The research has not yet been tested in humans. The scientists grew cancer cells in the lab in the absence of oestrogen and found they produced an alternative fuel, in the form of the cholesterol molecule. They then interfered with production of the molecule and found it slowed the cancer cells’ growth by between 30% and 50%.  The scientists say the findings are boosted by two studies which found the over-activation of certain genes linked to cholesterol production were linked with a poorer response to the anti-cancer drugs.  Cholesterol production by the tumour will not be the only reason why ER-positive breast cancers recur, but campaigners are excited by the possibilities for a treatment if further research corroborates these findings.  Delyth Morgan, chief executive at Breast Cancer Now, which funded the research, said: “This is a really crucial discovery. Far too many women have to deal with the potentially devastating consequences of their breast cancer coming back and this research presents an important opportunity to improve the effectiveness of today’s most commonly used treatments.  “This study breaks new ground in uncovering how some breast cancers continue to survive without oestrogen and suggests that women could benefit from adding statins to standard anti-hormone treatments. But this is early research and greater clinical evidence is now needed to understand the potential risks and benefits of this approach.”  Another charity, Breast Cancer Care, said the research was promising but needed further trials. “This early study raises an interesting question of whether cholesterol-reducing treatment, such as statins, could help lower the chances of breast cancer returning for some women who have developed a resistance to hormone therapy,” said Jane Murphy, clinical nurse specialist.  “We know that many women can be consumed with fear of their breast cancer coming back, which can have a huge impact on their ability to move forward after treatment. This discovery may, in future, help reduce these concerns for some patients, by allowing doctors to test if their cancer is likely to return, and tailor treatment accordingly.”	1
"En Español  By Ed Edelson  HealthDay Reporter  WEDNESDAY, March 10, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- A thyroid-derived cholesterol-lowering drug that could be an alternative to the widely used statin medications has done well in a small, early trial, Swedish and American researchers report.  In the trial, various doses of the drug, eprotirome, a laboratory-engineered version of thyroid hormone, were added to statin treatment for 168 people whose high levels of LDL cholesterol had not been lowered by previous use of statins. The combination did lower cholesterol levels in the 12-week trial and, most importantly, did not cause the feared side effects on the heart and other organs that have plagued similar thyroid-based treatments.  ""There was no doubt that eprotirome would lower LDL cholesterol. Thyroid hormone is nature's own statin,"" said Dr. Paul W. Ladenson, a professor of endocrinology and metabolism at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and lead author of a report on the trial, published in the March 11 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. ""But this is a demonstration of lipid-lowering effect without thyroid toxicity.""  Dr. Bo Angelin, a professor of clinical metabolic research at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, where the drug was developed, said that the trial demonstrated that careful targeting of the drug's effect within the body could obtain the benefits of thyroid hormone on blood cholesterol levels, without causing damaging side effects. The trial was funded in part by Karo Bio, a small commercial spinoff of the institute.  ""We knew that thyroid hormone could lower lipid [cholesterol] levels but would have side effects on the circulation and bones and cause diarrhea,"" Angelin said. ""Even if the lipid levels were OK, it would be overall negative for patients.""  However, he added, ""if we can get the thyroid effect in the liver [where cholesterol is metabolized] but not in other organs, we would be OK.""  Frequent monitoring showed no ill effects on the hearts and bones of those taking the drug, the report said.  And though statins are widely used and most often successful, an alternative to them would be welcome, Ladenson said. Statins are not effective in up to a quarter of potential users because of unacceptable muscle pain or simple failure to lower cholesterol levels, he said.  ""The first importance of the trial is that it shows hepatic [liver] targeting of hormonal action,"" Ladenson said. ""The second exciting part is its impact on lipids other than LDL cholesterol.""  Though statins lower LDL (""bad"") cholesterol, they have no effect on other blood fats, such as lipoprotein A, which is believed to be equally damaging, Ladenson said. He said that significant reductions of blood levels of those fats were seen in the trial.  Larger and longer studies are needed to determine whether eprotirome will have the hoped-for effect on blood fat levels without side effects and will ultimately reduce the risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular diseases, both Ladenson and Angelin said, adding that such trials now are in the planning stages.  At best, results would not be available for ""at least two to three years,"" Angelin said.  If eprotirome does pass all the anticipated tests successfully, its use at first probably would be in combination with a statin, Angelin said. Use as a single drug treatment for elevated cholesterol levels could follow, first in selected patients, then more widely, he said.  It's best to move cautiously, agreed Dr. Robert M. Califf, vice chancellor for clinical research at Duke University.  ""The effects on LDL cholesterol and lipoproteins are pretty exciting,"" Califf said. ""But if there is one thing we've learned about drugs in this arena, it's that we need large trials to see how they measure up in terms of risk and benefit.""  The trial's researchers were careful to list indications of possible harmful side effects, such as a reduction in levels of HDL (""good"") cholesterol, Califf said. But he echoed the thought that a longer-term and larger test is needed to determine the incidence of some possible major side effects, such as impotence.  ""I'm not sure I'd want to sign up for that one before I had longer-term results,"" Califf said. ""Being impotent is no fun.""

"En Español  MONDAY, Feb. 28, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy may be able to avoid the accompanying muscle loss and malnutrition by taking fish oil supplements that contain omega-3 fatty acids, new research suggests.  The finding is based on a small study involving just 40 lung cancer patients. Nevertheless, it raises hope that a simple, noninvasive intervention might go a long way towards countering the fatigue, poorer prognosis and impaired quality of life that can result from chemo-induced muscle mass loss.  ""Fish oil may prevent loss of weight and muscle by interfering with some of the pathways that are altered in advanced cancer,"" study author Dr. Vera Mazurak, of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, said in a news release. ""This holds great promise, because currently there is no effective treatment for cancer-related malnutrition.""  Mazurak and her colleagues report their observations in the Feb. 28 online edition of Cancer.  To explore the therapeutic potential of fish oil supplements, the authors offered 16 cancer patients undergoing an initial 10-week chemotherapy regimen a daily dose of 2.2 grams of a particular omega-3 fatty acid called eicosapentaenoic (EPA).  While these patients took fish oil supplements throughout their chemotherapy treatment, a second group of 24 patients underwent the same regimen minus the fish oil.  The results: continual muscle and fat measurements revealed that the group that took no fish oil supplementation lost an average of just over 5 pounds; the supplement group lost no weight.  What's more, blood analyses revealed that those in the fish oil group who had the biggest bump in bloodstream EPA concentrations also had the greatest muscle mass gains.  Specifically, nearly 70 percent of those in the fish oil group either kept their pre-chemo muscle mass or gained muscle. By comparison, less than 30 percent in the non-supplement group kept their original muscle mass.  Total fat tissue measurements were unaffected by fish oil supplementation, the team noted, and no side effects were observed.  The authors concluded that fish oil supplementation appears to be a safe and effective way to prevent malnutrition among cancer patients, and may ultimately prove to be of benefit for other groups of people, such as elderly patients who also face a significant ongoing risk for muscle loss.  Lona Sandon, a registered dietitian and assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Dallas, reacted with cautious optimism to the findings.  ""Malnutrition is a big concern with cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiation,"" she noted. ""Because first of all they do have wasting from the cancer itself, which is very metabolically active and eats up your energy stores. And then with chemotherapy, there is some inflammation that's detrimental to the heart and muscle, as it can cause muscle breakdown. And preservation of lean muscle tissue, we know, leads to better outcomes.""  ""So certainly this does seem to be promising,"" Sandon said. ""And other similar studies have looked at omega-3 and muscle preservation and have also suggested that fish oil can act to prevent inflammation caused by both disease and hardcore medications, like chemotherapy agents.""  ""But I would caution that the amount of pure concentrated fish oil supplement the people in this study were given is a lot,"" she added. ""Much much more than any recommended dietary allowance, along the lines of two to three servings of fish per week.""  But, she said, ""I would say this is certainly worthy of continuing research and exploration. But meanwhile, people should definitely not go out and start consuming huge amounts of fish oil.""

"(CNN) Stem cell research can run the gamut from Nobel Prize-winning scientists to hucksters in lab coats making a buck off desperate, seriously ill people. The results of one new study may be less than hoped for, but the science is sound: The study concluded that injecting stem cells into the spinal cords of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis is safe in most, though not all, cases. Unfortunately, the procedure provided no benefit to patients, though it caused substantial pain to two of the study participants.  Dr. Jonathan D. Glass, a professor of neurology and pathology at the Emory University School of Medicine and the director of the Emory ALS Center, specifically focused on human spinal cord-derived neural stem cells.  ""We put them into the spinal cord, and they came from a human spinal cord. The idea was that they would find a familiar and supportive environment,"" explained Glass.  In previous studies , Glass and his colleagues had transplanted such stem cells into the spinal cords of rodents with ALS and discovered that the treatment delayed the disease and improved survival.  Next, in a study of 12 patients , Glass tested the safety of injecting the stem cells into the spinal cords of humans. What he discovered during that experiment was that none of the patients suffered long-term effects (from either the surgical procedure or the implantation of stem cells), and no unusual acceleration of disease occurred. Importantly, one patient showed some improvement, though he and his colleagues noted that this outcome ""must be interpreted with caution"" since the study wasn't designed to measure effectiveness of the treatment.  For the new study, funded by the National Institutes of Health, Glass and his colleagues tested increasing amounts of stem cells injected into 15 patients who were not enrolled in his previous study.  What ALS does to the body  When someone gets ALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease, their motor network rapidly disintegrates. Nerve cells that communicate and control the voluntary muscles of the body (such as those in the arms, legs and face) degenerate or die. When communication between the brain and muscles ceases, the result is a gradual weakening and wasting away of muscles.  ""I always use the analogy of a house on fire,"" said Robert Goldstein, vice president of the ALS Therapy Development Institute . His nonprofit biotech research company has 25 therapeutic projects in progress, although none of them happens to be stem cell-based. ""The body is deteriorating rapidly.""  Juanita Pharr, director of care for the Georgia Chapter of the ALS Association , has both personal and professional experience with ALS: A medical social worker, she also watched her father die from the disease.  ""My father was actually 69 when he was diagnosed. Someone can go for two years without being diagnosed properly, and that was the case with my father,"" Pharr said.  Neither his primary care physician nor his neurologist could identify the cause of his deterioration. In fact, they first believed he had suffered a stroke. After all, ALS is rare, and in up to 90% of all cases, there is no family history and no known risk factors, as was the case with Pharr's father.  ALS affects men more often than women, usually between the ages of 40 and 70. Though more common between the ages of 60 and 69, this neurodegenerative disease can develop at any age, progressing rapidly. Most people with ALS die within three to five years after their symptoms begin, though about 10% survive for 10 years or longer. In Pharr's father's case, the progress of disease was rapid.  ""He did not want to go on the ventilator,"" she said, adding that many people prefer a ""natural death."" ALS often ends with respiratory failure since muscles in the diaphragm and chest walls eventually stop functioning. ""There's no cure, and we don't even have a treatment,"" she said.  According to Goldstein, this isn't entirely a negative. ""One of the things ALS has going for it is, since it has no effective treatment or cure, you throw anything you can at it,"" he said. While for many other diseases, the researchers are focused on just one modality, ongoing ALS research uses each of the four key modes of medical treatment: small molecules, proteins and biologics, gene therapy and stem cells.  Was this research necessary -- and ethical?  The ethics of human experimentation were thoroughly examined before the study began.  ""Ethical review happens at several levels: at the NIH, at the Food and Drug Administration and most importantly at University Institutional Review Boards at each institution where a faculty member is participating in a trial,"" Glass explained.  In Pharr's opinion, this and other stem cell studies are certainly fair from a participant's perspective, since beforehand, ""patients are presented with all the risk factors involved so they can make an informed decision."" Besides, she added, ""you automatically assume anyone with ALS can particip"	0
"By Steven Reinberg  HealthDay Reporter  MONDAY, Dec. 17, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- For patients whose high blood pressure cannot be controlled despite taking several medications, a short burst of radio waves at the nerves around the kidneys may do the trick, a small new study says.  The treatment was effective for at least six months. The findings could be a significant step in treating people with resistant hypertension, which is a major risk factor for heart attack and stroke, the researchers said.  The technique -- called catheter-based renal denervation -- is minimally invasive. In it, doctors use a catheter inserted through the artery in the groin, which sends radio waves burning away nerve tissue around the arteries that feed the kidneys.  The procedure destroys nerves that help control and filter salt in the body and may be overactive in patients with high blood pressure. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved its use.  The study was funded by medical device maker Medtronic. The findings were published Dec. 17 in the journal Circulation.  ""This is a very promising approach for managing medication-resistant hypertension,"" said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a spokesman for the American Heart Association and professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles.  ""High blood pressure is a major contributor to heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and [kidney] failure,"" said Fonarow, who was not involved in the study. ""Despite the availability of a number of effective medications, many patients with hypertension have not achieved adequate control of their blood pressure. There is thus an important, but currently unmet, need for additional therapies to effectively control hypertension.""  For the study, an international team lead by Dr. Murray Esler, professor and senior director of the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne, Australia, assigned 35 patients to renal denervation and compared them to 47 patients who had already had the procedure.  All the patients suffered from drug-resistant hypertension. Their systolic blood pressure -- the top number in a blood-pressure reading -- remained dangerously high at 160 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) or above despite having taking three or more drugs to control blood pressure, the researchers noted.  Esler's team found that more than 83 percent of those who had denervation treatment before had a drop in systolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg after six months and almost 79 percent maintained the reduction at 12 months.  The 35 patients in this phase of the study had similar results to the initial group. Almost 63 percent of these patients saw a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg or more six months after treatment.  Fonarow noted: ""In all, reductions in systolic blood-pressure levels on the order of 25 to 30 mmHg were achieved and maintained without any loss in efficacy.""  The procedure is safe as well as effective, the study authors said.  ""Participants' kidneys were not damaged or functionally impaired,"" Esler said in a journal news release. ""We also found no ill effects on long-term health from the procedure.""  Whether this technique might be useful in treating less severe high blood pressure hasn't yet been tested. If it is applicable, it could mean patients need not take blood-pressure drugs, Esler suggested.  Another expert, however, said that scenario is likely overoptimistic.  ""Hypertension is a hard disease to treat because there are so many things that go into getting blood pressure under control,"" said Dr. Varinder Singh, chairman of cardiology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""There's lifestyle and diet, there is getting to the right doses of medications, there are adherence issues. So anything that will help patients get their goals is exciting.""  Even with this technique, people will most likely still have to take blood-pressure medications, Singh said. ""You may have to take less medication and you may have to take lower doses of medication, but we all expect that patients will still have to take some medication,"" he said.  Singh also noted that although this procedure is used in other countries it is not yet approved in the United States.  Fonarow added: ""While this study demonstrates that renal denervation provides sustained reduction of blood pressure up to one year and appears safe, additional studies with longer-term follow-up are needed.""  According to the American Heart Association, more than 78 million adults in the United States have high blood pressure, which is blood pressure higher than 140/90 mmHg.  Among these adults, about 9 percent have resistant hypertension, which means that even taking three or more medications to control their blood pressure, it remains higher than 140/90 mmHg.

"En Español  By Steven Reinberg  HealthDay Reporter  TUESDAY, May 31, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- At the moment, a diagnosis of autism is based on subjective evaluations, but a new way of using MRI might be an objective way of spotting the disorder, Columbia University researchers report.  Autism is a spectrum disorder that includes repetitive behaviors and impairments in language, communication and social skills. It is estimated that the condition affects one in 110 children in the United States, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  ""There is a serious unmet need in the autism world, where diagnosis is currently done by subjective reports, and after the child has missed many developmental milestones,"" said lead researcher Joy Hirsch, a professor of functional neuroradiology, neuroscience and psychology, and director of the Functional MRI Laboratory at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City.  ""It is now possible to develop an objective imaging diagnostic,"" she said. Indeed, the researchers found a difference between autistic brains and typical brains in the level of responsiveness in language areas, Hirsch noted.  ""What we can measure are signals in the brain, in a specific language area, that are depressed in autistic children and normal in typical children,"" she said.  Although this study was done with school-aged children and teens, the same test can be done with children as young as 18 months, Hirsch noted. ""We know this technique can be used on young children,"" she said.  The report was released in the May 31 online edition of Radiology, in advance of publication in the August print issue.  For the study, 12 children with autism and 15 children without the condition underwent functional MRI (fMRI) exams. Both groups of children ranged in age from 4 to 17 years.  While the children were undergoing the fMRI, the researchers played recordings of their parents talking to them and watched for brain activity in areas of the brain responsible for hearing and understanding language.  The researchers found no differences in the activity in the hearing area of the brain between the two groups. However, in the language comprehension area, there was significantly more activity among typical children than among children with autism, Hirsch's group noted.  To further test this screening approach, another group of 27 autistic children, aged 5 to 17, underwent fMRI and the researchers were able to identify 26 of them as autistic.  Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York in Lake Success, said that ""although the investigators did indeed find significant differences on neuroimaging between controls and autistic children, the clinical utility from a diagnostic standpoint is unclear.""  There are important limitations to the study, Adesman said.  For one, this study was done in school-aged children, many of whom were actually teenagers, so it is impossible to know if these differences in neuroimaging would also be found in younger patients, Adesman pointed out.  ""It is during the toddler/preschool years that autism typically presents and needs to be diagnosed,"" he explained.  ""The other major limitation of this study is that the investigators did not look at whether these brain differences are specific to children with autism, or if they would also be seen, for example, in children with language delays who are not autistic,"" Adesman said.  Hirsch noted the study is preliminary and, as such, has some limitations. For one, it is not known whether this technique can identify autism across the entire spectrum of the disorder.  ""There are questions about how this varies across the severity of autism. Also, can we distinguish autism from other forms of developmental delay?"" she asked. ""These are things that aren't known.""  Further work is needed to refine the test, Hirsch added. ""This is not the diagnostic that you can package and send to all community health centers in the United States. This is an announcement that this can be done,"" she said.  This test costs no more than a standard MRI, which runs around $1,500, Hirsch noted.  Another expert, Dr. Robert F. Lopez-Alberola, chief of pediatric neurology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, said that ""it's nice to have an objective measure, but it doesn't really do much.""  Ultimately, he said, ""the diagnosis of autism is a clinical diagnosis. I see this as having more implications for research into the pathophysiology of autism.""  However, if this test could be done in really young children, it might help identify autism so that treatment can begin early, Lopez-Alberola suggested. ""We know the earlier we begin interventions, the greater the likelihood of better outcome,"" he said.  ""Although this technique holds promise for identifying infants at risk for autism, it still needs to be determined whether the atypical patterns of"	0
Hormone therapy is the only FDA-approved treatment for hot flashes related to menopause, but many women are reluctant to undergo hormone therapy because its long-term use has been linked to an increased risk for breast cancer and stroke .  The study was presented in Chicago at the annual meeting of the North American Menopause Society (NAMS).  In a manufacturer-funded study, the drug Serada proved to be more effective than placebo for preventing hot flashes and reducing their severity.  Oct. 6, 2010 -- An extended-release version of the seizure and pain drug gabapentin may be one step closer to becoming the first approved nonhormonal treatment for menopause -related hot flashes .  Gabapentin Side Effects  In earlier studies, immediate-release gabapentin was shown to be an effective treatment for hot flashes. But side effects, including dizziness and daytime sleepiness, were commonly reported by users.  Michael Sweeney, MD, who is vice president of research and development for Serada manufacturer Depomed Inc., says the company’s slow-release gabapentin formulation avoids many of these side effects.  About 60% of women who took the experimental drug in one study reported side effects, compared to about 50% of women taking placebo pills. About 8% and 18% of Serada users reported daytime sleepiness and dizziness, respectively, compared to about 3% and 8% of women who took a placebo.  “These side effects, when they did occur, tended to occur early in treatment and disappear within a few weeks,” Sweeney says.  Researchers presented findings from two studies of Serada at the NAMS meeting.  In one study, the number of daily hot flashes experienced by postmenopausal women taking 1,800 milligrams of the drug per day declined from around 10 to around 2. But a similar reduction in hot flashes was seen in women who took placebo pills instead of the slow-release gabapentin.  In the second study, about 65% of women taking Serada reported significant improvement in hot flash symptoms after 12 weeks of treatment, compared to 45% of women taking placebo.  NAMS founder and former executive director Wulf Utian, MD, says Serada does not appear to be as effective as hormonal therapy, but it may be a useful alternative treatment for women who can’t take hormones or don’t want to.  Utian is now an independent consultant and was a co-author of one of the studies.  “Estrogen and estrogen-progestin drugs are about 95% effective for treating hot flashes,” he tells WebMD. “This drug was about 60% to 65% effective, which is about the same efficacy that has been reported with antidepressants [for treatment of hot flashes].”	0
The treatment is also gaining attention from mainstream researchers, including some former skeptics. The National Institute of Mental Health recently sponsored its first study of neurofeedback for A.D.H.D.: a randomized, controlled trial of 36 subjects.  The results are to be announced Oct. 26 at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry. In an interview in the summer, the study’s director, Dr. L. Eugene Arnold, an emeritus professor of psychiatry at Ohio State, noted that there had been “quite a bit of improvement” in many of the children’s behavior, as reported by parents and teachers.  Dr. Arnold said that if the results bore out that neurofeedback was making the difference, he would seek financing for a broader study, with as many as 100 subjects.  John Kounios, a professor of psychology at Drexel University, published a small study in 2007 suggesting that the treatment speeded cognitive processing in elderly people. “There’s no question that neurofeedback works, that people can change brain activity,” he said. “The big questions we still haven’t answered are precisely how it works and how it can be harnessed to treat disorders.”  Photo  Russell A. Barkley, a professor of psychiatry at the Medical University of South Carolina and a leading authority on attention problems, has long dismissed claims that neurofeedback can help. But Dr. Barkley says he was persuaded to take another look after Dutch scientists published an analysis of recent international studies finding significant reductions in impulsiveness and inattention.  Still, Dr. Barkley cautioned that he had yet to see credible evidence confirming claims that such benefits can be long lasting, much less permanent.  And another mainstream expert is much more disapproving. William E. Pelham Jr., director of the Center for Children and Families at Florida International University, called neurofeedback “crackpot charlatanism.” He warned that exaggerated claims for it might lead parents to favor it over proven options like behavioral therapy and medication.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Neurofeedback was developed in the 1960s and ’70s, with American researchers leading the way. In 1968, M. Barry Sterman, a neuroscientist at the University of California, Los Angeles, reported that the training helped cats resist epileptic seizures. Dr. Sterman and others later claimed to have achieved similar benefits with humans.  The findings prompted a boomlet of interest in which clinicians of varying degrees of respectability jumped into the field, making many unsupported claims about seeming miracle cures and tainting the treatment’s reputation among academic experts. Meanwhile, researchers in Germany and the Netherlands continued to explore neurofeedback’s potential benefits.  A major attraction of the technique is the hope that it can help patients avoid drugs, which often have side effects. Instead, patients practice routines that seem more like exercising a muscle.  Brain cells communicate with one another, in part, through a constant storm of electrical impulses. Their patterns show up on an electroencephalogram, or EEG, as brain waves with different frequencies.

Neurofeedback practitioners say people have problems when their brain wave frequencies aren’t suited for the task at hand, or when parts of the brain aren’t communicating adequately with other parts. These issues, they say, can be represented on a “brain map,” the initial EEG readings that serve as a guide for treatment. Subsequently, a clinician will help a patient learn to slow down or speed up those brain waves, through a process known as operant conditioning. The brain begins by generating fairly random patterns, while the computer software responds with encouragement whenever the activity meets the target.  Dr. Norman Doidge, a psychiatrist at the Center for Psychoanalytic Training and Research at Columbia and the author of “The Brain That Changes Itself” (Viking, 2007), said he considered neurofeedback “a powerful stabilizer of the brain.” Practitioners make even more enthusiastic claims. Robert Coben, a neuropsychologist in Massapequa Park, N.Y., said he had treated more than 1,000 autistic children over the past seven years and had conducted a clinical study, finding striking reductions in symptoms, as reported by parents.

There was a time when the optimal exercise speed was however fast you had to run to get away from a saber-tooth tiger. Even today, in much of the developing world, people exercise through activities such as farming and fetching water that are necessary for survival.  However, in the developed Western world, where exercise tends to be an extracurricular activity, there is apparently tremendous interest in just how fast you should move in order to improve your health. Consider, for example, the many posts on The New York Times’ Well blog on the topic (walking versus running, the “right dose of exercise,” “walk hard, walk easy”), all of which focus on the relative benefits of walking versus jogging versus running.  So is it better to walk? To walk fast? To run slow? To run fast? On its face, this question is poorly posed, since it says nothing about our goals or our constraints. Am I aiming to lose weight? To live longer? To win road races? Am I willing to exercise for three hours a day? Twenty minutes? Almost never? Clearly, these considerations matter when trying to determine the optimal speed. Here is how I would think about asking the question instead: What is the easiest way to reduce my chance of death?  To analyze the impact of walking or running, researchers need a way to describe the effort exerted. The ideal measure would combine the length of time spent exercising with the amount of energy expended — basically, we want to figure out a way to credit people who walk at half the speed for twice as long the same amount as those who walk faster for less time.  The way researchers do this is with a measurement known as MET — metabolic equivalent of task — which gives a numeric value to various activities depending on their energy intensity. By multiplying an activity’s METs by the time you engage in it, you can get an overall measure of how much energy you expend.  The goal here is to use these METs and their relationship to health to analyze the value of walking compared with jogging or running. At least in this article, I won’t say anything about other kinds of exercise — no yoga or SoulCycle — though these have their own MET measures.  Let’s first look at the results from two papers — here and here — that relate energy expenditures from walking (in MET hours per day) to the risk of death.  Doing this analysis is a little complicated. You can’t look at the relationship between exercise and the chance of ever dying, because ultimately everyone dies. Instead, these studies look at whether exercise changes the risk of death at a given time. But since the people in the studies are of different ages, researchers can’t just look to see whether they have, say, a 2 percentage point lower risk of death in a given year, since that lower risk would mean a lot more for someone who is 30 than for someone who is 90. Results in these two papers — and basically all the others we’ll look at here — therefore report their results in “hazard ratios.” A hazard rate of 0.90, for example, means a 10 percent reduction in the risk of death. If there is a 10 in 1,000 chance you’ll die in the next year without exercise, this means by exercising you’d reduce that chance to 9 in 1,000.  This research shows that those who walk have a lower risk of mortality relative to people in the comparison group, who don’t walk for exercise at all (they probably do still walk some, just not for exercise). This risk of death is lower even with a very minimal energy expenditure. The lowest-energy-expenditure group in each study is walking at about 3 mph for 20 to 40 minutes per day. In other words, a mile or two of walking. In exchange, their risk of death goes down by 10 percent.  Walking a bit farther — say, 2 to 3 miles at 3 mph — gets you an additional death reduction of about 30 percent. But walking more than that, or more than an hour a day at this speed, is no better.  Other studies of walking find similar magnitudes. A large meta-analysis found that, on average, walking 1 to 3 miles at about a 20-minute-mile pace results in a reduction in death risk of about 10 percent.  Many of these studies do not separate out speed and duration, but to the extent they do, it seems like walking faster may be better than walking slower. Here is one study that shows large mortality reductions for fast walking even for short periods, and here is another showing that very slow walking has fewer benefits than faster walking.  At first glance, it may seem obvious that the harder you exercise, the better. If walking faster is more energy-intensive than walking slower, and running is more energy-intensive than walking, it seems like the health benefits of running would be even greater. In some sense, you’d hope so, since most of us find running more difficult than walking.  Broadly, over some range, this seems to be right. The chart below shows results for two studies of runners that, again, relate METs to hazard rates of death. Running — even slowly, like 5 mph	0
During a traumatic divorce, Ronni Shapiro of Westhampton Beach, N.Y., became severely depressed and suicidal. Psychiatrists put her on different antidepressants that only aggravated her situation.  “Within three months, I was on 10 different medications,” Shapiro, 61, said. “It was horrible.”  Eventually, she learned about GeneSight, a new type of genetic testing by Myriad Genetics, meant to help avoid the painful trial-and-error process many depression patients endure in the search for the right medicine. After a simple cheek swab, her results showed that pretty much everything she had previously tried was in the “significant gene interaction” category, meaning that based on her genetic makeup, these medicines would adversely affect her or prove ineffective at normal doses.  Guided by her results, her doctor thought that Wellbutrin would be a more promising option. And though the test is better at saying what won’t work than what will, her doctor’s decision proved the right one.  “I can’t tell you that I am footloose and fancy-free,” Shapiro said. “I still suffer. But when I fall into those dark holes, there’s like a ladder that I can see to climb up, as opposed to feeling helpless.”  As many as two-thirds of people with depression aren’t helped by the first antidepressant they try, leaving many to spend months after they are diagnosed without real help.  >> READ MORE: In despair from major depression, I turned to a last resort: Magnets  In May, Myriad Genetics released the first large-scale test of whether treatment guided by genetics (pharmacogenomics) would improve overall outcomes for patients with major depression. The study found that patients were 30 percent more likely to respond to treatment when their medication selection was guided by the company’s GeneSight test. The test uses a proprietary algorithm to analyze 12 different genes to weigh their combined influence on patient response to more than 55 psychotropic drugs. The patient’s color-coded report would read: “Use as directed” in green, “moderate gene-drug interaction” in yellow, and “significant gene interaction” in red.  Now, another company, Genomind in King of Prussia, is offering free education about its genetic test, Genecept Assay, at Sav-On pharmacies in two Philadelphia-area Acme Markets.  Specially trained pharmacists may decide to counsel patients about the Genecept test if they see a pattern of unsuccessful treatment with medicine for depression, anxiety, and/or obsessive-compulsive disorder.  No magic solution  But while genetic testing offers tools to better guide patients’ treatment, it cannot tell doctors exactly which medicines will work – or necessarily provide the key to enduring remission from depression.  Vincent Sparks of Mullica Hill has benefited from genetic testing, but his mental health issues have persisted. Having battled anxiety and depression most of his life, Sparks, 60, was happy to find a genetic test to help his psychiatrist better direct his treatment. After taking the Genecept test, he discovered that a combination of Prozac and Lamictal was a better genetic fit for him than previous medications. But Sparks continues to struggle.  “I have times where I’m fairly level for a while, but at times it seems like I’m on a roller coaster,” Sparks said. “Sometimes I wish I could just take out my brain and wash it. If I could just put it through the rinse cycle, things would be better.”  Though imperfect, the Genecept test has been shown in peer-reviewed published studies to improve patient outcomes and reduce overall medical costs. “In medicine in general, this will be standard of care at some point,” said Dan Dowd, Genomind vice president. “Twenty years from now, everyone will have some kind of pharmacological genetic test as part of their health record.”  GeneSight’s test is covered by Medicare for patients under the care of psychiatrists and who have failed to achieve satisfactory results with at least one antidepressant. The company has coverage with some commercial payers and is working to widen that coverage, said Myriad Genetics spokesman Ron Rogers. The Genomind Genecept Assay is covered by Medicare and Medicaid. If the out-of-pocket cost for people with commercial plans is more than $300, Genomind will contact the client before processing the test. The company also has a financial assistance program for uninsured patients.  “This is the beginning of personalized precision treatment,” said John Greden of the University of Michigan, primary investigator of the GeneSight study. “One-size treatment will never fit all, and we’re finally getting the tools, not just to say that but to act on it.”  ‘Knowledge is a good thing’  Michael Thase, a psychiatry professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Perelman School of Medicine and director of Penn’s Mood and Anxiety program, was another author of the GeneSight study. He stressed that although the test does not tell you exactly what will work, it can indicate a ho	0
(Reuters Health) - - Exhausted shift workers may be safer driving home at night when they’re exposed to bright light before they hit the road, a small study suggests.  To test the effect of light therapy on driving, researchers did a series of three experiments with 19 adults. In two scenarios, participants spent a night being sleep-deprived in a lab and then spent 45 minutes in dim or bright light before a driving test. For a third test, people got a good nights’ sleep at home and then went to the lab for 45 minutes of bright light exposure before a driving test.  After sleep deprivation in the lab, five people exposed to dim light therapy got in car accidents during the driving simulations. None of the people who slept at home crashed, and neither did any of the sleep-deprived people who got bright light therapy before getting behind the wheel, the study found.  “We experience severe sleepiness toward the end of the night shift, and this may overlap with our commute time,” said senior study author Dr. Ralph Mistlberger of Simon Fraser University in British Columbia, Canada.  “Sleep deprivation makes this worse of course, and together with the clock, this conspires to impair our ability to sustain attention to task (e.g., driving), and avoid distraction, and react quickly to external stimuli like traffic lights, brake lights in front of you, road signs, etc,” Mistlberger added by email.  “Bright light is alerting,” Mistlberger said.  Sleepiness is a leading risk factor for automobile accidents because it can make drivers less vigilant, slow reaction times and dull cognitive abilities, researchers note in Sleep Medicine.  Shift workers with chronic sleep deprivation also face an increased risk of accidents. Strategies like drinking coffee or soda, napping before a drive or blasting music or rolling down the windows in the car may help increase alertness behind the wheel, but none of these strategies is fool-proof.  For the current study, researchers wanted to see if bright light might help reduce driving impairments related to sleep deprivation.  They found participants had lower body temperatures after spending a sleep-deprived night in the lab, as well as longer reaction times and increased sleepiness.  Exposure to bright light didn’t appear to improve reaction times or sleepiness. But light was associated with better driving.  Beyond its small size, other limitations of the study include the reliance on lab conditions for sleep deprivation and light exposure, which may not match what shift workers would experience on the job, the authors note.  “There is evidence that the use of bright light at the office (or even at home directly prior to beginning the work shift) may be beneficial in preventing sleep deprivation-related motor vehicle collisions,” said Russell Griffin, a researcher at the University of Alabama at Birmingham who wasn’t involved in the study.  “That said, there is not enough evidence to date to fully suggest the use of bright light therapy to avoid collision,” Griffin added by email.  The proven way to avoid the effects of sleepiness on the road is to consistently get enough sleep, said Dr. Flaura Koplin Winston, a researcher at the University of Pennsylvania and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia who wasn’t involved in the study.  “Drowsy driving is perhaps the most under-recognized cause of serious crashes and sadly, the evidence is not there on how to counter it,” Winston said by email.  More research is needed on the potential of bright light therapy to make exhausted drivers safer, said Dr. Donald Redelmeier, a researcher at the University of Toronto who wasn’t involved in the study.  But there are still things drivers can do now to stay safer on the road.  “Safety strategies while driving can include minimizing distractions, stopping at stop signs, respecting speed limits, yielding right-of-way, buckling a seatbelt, signaling all turns and not driving after drinking alcohol,” Redelmeier said.

"An Online Program May Help Prevent Depression In Some People  Enlarge this image toggle caption WIN-Initiative RM/Getty Images WIN-Initiative RM/Getty Images  Working through a self-help program online can prevent or delay major depression disorder in people who are vulnerable, a study finds. Similar programs have been used to treat depression, but this may be the first one tested to prevent it, the researchers say.  Online programs for mental health problems can be as effective as face-to-face treatment and offer some advantages: Low cost, available at any time and customizable. But they're not panaceas.  In this experiment, half of the participants were asked to do six half-hour-long exercises that were based on cognitive behavioral therapy and problem-solving therapy, which are techniques commonly used for in-person therapy.  In the cognitive behavioral therapy, participants were asked to identify positive activities they used to engage in and then are asked to actively plan those activities again. At the next session, participants reflect on their experiences.  For the problem-solving therapy, people were asked to create a list of the things that matter most to them in their lives and brainstorm on how to incorporate those things into daily life. They next were asked to categorize problems and worries into ""manageable"" and ""unmanageable""; the main focus in problem-solving therapy is to tackle those problems that are considered manageable.  Both cognitive-behavioral therapy and problem-solving therapy are intended to change negative thinking in order to alter mood and behavior.  After completing each exercise, participants in the intervention group received written individualized feedback from an online trainer. The trainers did not offer any therapeutic advice, only motivation and encouragement to continue the exercises. Participants also could repeat the online sessions as often as they liked.  The control group received information about depression but was under no obligation to read it.  The study, which was conducted by researchers from Leuphana University in Lueneburg, Germany, recruited 406 people with subthreshold depression, which is defined as having some symptoms of depression but not enough to be diagnosed with major depressive disorder. It was published Tuesday in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association.  Of the 406 participants that began the study, 335 completed the telephone follow-up at the end of 12 months. Twenty-seven percent in the intervention group experienced depression compared with 41 percent in the control group.  It is unclear if the people who went on to develop major depressive disorder had experienced it before. Lead author Claudia Buntrock, a PhD candidate in clinical psychology at Leuphana, says that because the study only tracked participants' mental health over the course of 12 months, the long-term effectiveness of the intervention is unknown.  It's also not clear if this kind of program could be scaled up. It took the trainers about 30 minutes to provide feedback for each session, and they also stayed in touch with participants via instant messaging, Buntrock says.  Other experiments with online therapy have found that people didn't continue it if it wasn't guided by an actual human. One reason could be that when people are depressed, they can have a hard time getting motivated to do things.  ""More studies are needed to evaluate the preventive effects of unguided web-based interventions on the onset of major depressive disorder,"" Buntrock wrote in an email. Still, Buntrock seems pleased with the results, especially since the German insurance company BARMER GEK that sponsored the trial is now providing it to its customers.  ""I was surprised by the big response to our study,"" Buntrock wrote. ""And of course, I'm surprised about what happens now; that a health insurance company offers the intervention to its members. It's a success story you might dream of when you start, but it actually seeing to happen is a great feeling."""	0
Eating for two is exciting, but comes with a lot of baggage: weight gain, uncontrollable cravings for ice cream and pickles, and constant concern over whether your growing baby is getting all the nutrients it needs, to name a few.  Now, findings published in Applied Physiology, Nutrition and Metabolism reveal that most women aren’t getting enough omega-3 fatty acids – healthy fats found in fish, walnuts, avocados and supplements. Specifically, they aren’t getting enough DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), an omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (omega 3-LCPUFA) that's critical to a baby's brain development. DHA is primarily obtained by eating fish and other seafood.  For the study, researchers from Canada's University of Alberta studied 600 women during and after pregnancy to monitor their intake of omega 3-LCPUFAs. These include DHA, EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DPA (docosapentaenoic acid). DHA is believed to be the biggest player in neurological health and is the primary structural fat found in the brain.  The American Dietetic Association recommends that healthy adults, including pregnant and lactating women, get at least 500 milligrams per day of omega 3-LCPUFAs. Meanwhile, the International Society for the Study of Fatty Acids and Lipids advises that pregnant and lactating women consume at least 200 mg of DHA per day.  The researchers found that only 27 percent of women during pregnancy and 25 percent of women three-months postpartum were meeting those DHA recommendations.  The Power of DHA  “Omega 3s are needed for the infant’s brain and nervous system to develop properly,” says contributing study author Catherine Field, a registered dietitian and professor of nutrition at the University of Alberta. “Also, the membranes of every cell in a person’s body contain omega-3 fatty acids. They are needed for the cell to grow and function.” After all, during pregnancy and breastfeeding, babies are doing at lot of growing.  What’s more, during pregnancy omega-3 fatty acids are required for mom’s body to produce more red blood cells so that she can provide enough nutrients and oxygen to her growing baby. These fatty acids also help the placenta grow and function as needed, Field says. It’s this placenta that omega-3 fatty acids including DHA diffuse across to reach the baby and spur brain development, says Dr. Vincenzo Berghella, past president of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine as well as professor and director of the division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.  Not surprisingly, low intake of DHA in moms is linked to babies with lower cognitive development (often associated with crying and poor sleep) as well as lower IQs and attention deficit disorders, Field says. What’s more, her previous research in both animals and humans shows that DHA intake during breastfeeding impacts infants’ immune system development, which may explain why babies who receive low amounts of DHA through breast milk have an increased risk of asthma and allergies. She also notes that DHA supplementation may help prevent preterm labor, preeclampsia and postpartum depression.  However, whether DHA benefits more than babies' brain health isn't conclusive. “Data from observational studies and from randomized controlled trials suggest that omega-3 during pregnancy could be associated with several benefits such as lower risk of preterm birth, preeclampsia and other obstetrics complications. However, there are contradicting results,” Berghella says.  In fact, Berghella’s 2015 review of 34 randomized controlled trials found that omega-3 supplementation during pregnancy was not associated with decreases in risk. However, the review did find that women with single-child pregnancies (no multiples) had a 73 percent lower risk of stillbirth or early infant death if they began supplementation by 20 weeks into their pregnancies.  How to Get More DHA  Sushi’s one thing, but during pregnancy, you shouldn’t lay off seafood entirely, Berghella says. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that pregnant and breastfeeding women eat at least two servings of fish or shellfish (about 8 to 12 ounces) every week. But take care to choose low-mercury options such as shrimp, salmon and catfish. The group recommends avoiding shark, swordfish, king mackerel and tilefish, and limiting white tuna consumption to 6 ounces per week.  Hitting those recommendations will get you approximately 1,400 mg of DHA per week, Berghella says. (While that’s not exactly 200 mg per day, if you average your intake out over the course of a 7-day week, you still hit recommended amounts.) In the University of Alberta study, seafood, fish and seaweed products contributed to 79 percent of women’s omega 3-LCPUFA intakes from food. The biggest source: salmon. Good thing, as a 2007 study published in The Lancet found that children born to mothers who reported no seafood intake had the greatest risk of behavioral prob	0
You don’t have to break a sweat to reap the health benefits of physical activity, according to new research in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. In a study of women age 65 and older, just 30 minutes a day of light exercise—like running errands and cleaning the house—was linked to a lower risk of death.  Moderate-intensity exercise, like leisurely bike riding or brisk walking, was associated with an even greater reduction in risk. The authors say that improving doing more light and moderate physical activity could be almost as effective as rigorous exercise at preventing disease and prolonging life. “The paradigm needs to shift when we think about being active,” says senior author Andrea LaCroix, professor of family medicine and public health at the University of California San Diego.  For the study, LaCroix and her colleagues asked 6,000 women, ages 65 to 99, to wear activity-tracking accelerometers for seven days as they went about their daily activities. The women were then followed for an average of three years.  Health Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips. View Sample Sign Up Now  Based on the data from the women’s activity trackers, the researchers found that those who got at least 30 minutes of light physical activity a day were 12% less likely to die, compared to those who got less. Those who got an additional 30 minutes of moderate activity were 39% less likely to die.  Light physical activity includes just about any type of behavior that isn’t sitting down: walking to the mailbox, strolling around the neighborhood and doing laundry. Activities like these account for more than 55% of older adults’ daily activity, says LaCroix, so the fact that they were protective in this study is very good news.  “We’ve always been told that this type of activity isn’t enough to do you good,” says LaCroix. “But what we have here is solid evidence that light physical activity reduces a woman’s risk of dying over the next three to four years—and we see the benefits are substantial and independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.”  MORE: TIME’s Guide to Exercise  The study could not show a cause-and-effect relationship between activity level and risk of death, only an association. But the link was present in all types of women in the study, including those of all races and ethnicities, women who were obese and those who were not, women with high and low functional abilities and women older and younger than 80.  As adults get older, they expend more energy doing the same activities they did when they were younger, LaCroix says—so they don’t need to exercise as much, or as intensely, to burn the same amount of calories or get their heart rate up. “We know that people of different ages need different amounts and intensities of exercise to get the same result,” she says. “It’s not one size fits all.”  But national guidelines still recommend that adults over age 65 follow the same guidelines as younger people: to get at least 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week. And recent analyses, compiled from studies in which adults self-reported their levels of physical activity, have suggested that older adults have to log moderate-to-vigorous exercise in order to reduce their risk of early death.

"En Español  By Alan Mozes  HealthDay Reporter  SUNDAY, April 14, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- A method designed to target, freeze and destroy a tumor's cellular function seems effective in combating lung tumors, a small ongoing study finds.  At least in the short-run -- meaning three months after the procedure -- the intervention known as ""cryoablation"" appeared to kill all targeted tumors that had spread to the lung from elsewhere, preliminary results suggest.  However, some patients developed new tumors in that time period, the researchers noted.  The study authors cautioned that while the initial findings are encouraging, the treatment should not be seen as a cure for this type of metastatic (spreading) lung disease. Rather, they said that for certain patients who may not be eligible for more standard surgical approaches, the therapy has potential as an alternative means for offering an improved quality of life for a longer period of time.  ""'Promising' is the perfect way to describe our findings,"" said study lead author Dr. David Woodrum, an interventional radiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. ""But whether or not this minimally invasive approach would ultimately become a primary method of treatment in the future will depend on the long-term results of this trial, which is still under way. At this point I would say that cryoablation has the most applicability as a kind of last-ditch treatment for patients who are not good surgical candidates for a variety of reasons.""  Woodrum and his colleagues are scheduled to discuss their findings Sunday in New Orleans at the annual meeting of the Society of Interventional Radiology. Funding for their work was provided by Galil Medical, a medical device manufacturer based in Arden Hills, Minn.  Because this study was presented at a medical meeting, the conclusions should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.  The U.S. National Cancer Institute points out that while cryoablation (also known as cryosurgery) is a well-known practice, researchers are still in the process of assessing its long-term benefits.  The procedure is performed by an interventional radiologist on patients coping with metastasized lung tumors, the researchers noted. Using CT-imaging equipment, the physician inserts a small needle-like instrument directly into the tumor to deliver the freezing power (at temperatures as low as minus 100 degrees Celsius) of liquid nitrogen to cancer cells, while sparing healthy surrounding tissue.  To date, the team behind the new study has used the procedure to tackle a total of 36 tumors in 22 American and French patients --13 men and nine women -- whose average age was 60. Fifteen patients had just one tumor, while the rest had two or more. None of the patients was deemed eligible for standard surgical interventions.  The targeted tumors were less than 3.5 centimeters (about 1.4 inches), which Woodrum described as being ""small to medium in size.""  The procedure was performed under either general anesthesia or conscious sedation, and lasted anywhere from 45 minutes to nearly three hours. Typically, patients were able to return home the following day.  The result: Among the 15 patients seen roughly three months post-procedure, tumor control was found to be 100 percent, although six patients were found to have developed new lung tumors in the interim.  Among five patients seen six months after the procedure, tumor control continued to be 100 percent.  The authors noted that side effects were minimal, typically involving air or fluid around the lungs after the procedure, and in all cases were resolved quickly.  The team concluded that cryoablation appears to be both safe and effective, at least in the short-term. But they acknowledged that more research needs to be done to track the treatment's impact over the long haul.  ""It would be overreaching to say that we're curing cancer with this,"" Woodrum said. ""But this is one of many therapy options that is looking to turn cancer into a chronic fight, and to give patients for whom the choices are limited a chance at a good quality of life with minimal treatment complications.""  For his part, Dr. David Carbone, a professor and director of the James Thoracic Center at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, said that the findings regarding cryoablation are ""not incredibly novel,"" given that the procedure has been around for years.  ""And I would say that there are multiple different technologies for doing this kind of very localized approach,"" he added. He mentioned stereotactic radiosurgery -- which targets the tumor with high-power X-rays -- as another way to go.  ""While I've done cryoablation myself in the past, it's not what I typically do,"" Carbone noted. ""Stereotactic is noninvasive and doesn't require general anesthesia, so that's what I'd tend to do, although certainly what approach is ideal will depend on a particular patient's situation and symptoms. But there's no si"	0
Leonard Guarente, one of the best-known antiaging researchers in the region, and the roster of eminent scientists have formed Elysium Health, which on Tuesday will debut its first product, a pill called Basis. They say it will enable the body to produce more of a natural compound that supports a healthy metabolism.  A leading biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with backing from five scientists who are Nobel prize recipients, is wading into the murky world of dietary supplements with a new antiaging pill that is said to restore muscle tissue, improve brain function, and increase energy levels by improving “metabolic health.”  Advertisement  Many products in the supplement business are launched with questionable science, but Elysium said studies in mice show a clear connection between increased levels of this compound, called NAD, and improved health in older mice.  “There have been a lot of new findings in the past five years identifying some extremely promising compounds that promote wellness and health. [We want to] make them available for people to improve their health before they get sick,” said Guarente, an Elysium Health founder and its chief scientific officer. “We are filling a space by combining natural compounds with scientific validation.”  The active ingredients in Basis are nicotinamide riboside, a substance that makes NAD and is found in traces in many foods such as milk, and pterostilbene, an antioxidant found in blueberries. Both substances are available individually as dietary supplements.  At a recommended dose of two gel caps daily, a month’s supply of Basis will cost $60 ($50 with a membership) and will be available online only. The company’s chief executive is Eric Marcotulli, previously a partner at the Silicon Valley venture firm Sequoia Capital.  Among the scientific heavyweights advising Elysium Health are Martin Karplus, emeritus professor of chemistry at Harvard and a 2013 Nobel Laureate; Tom Sudhof, a Stanford School of Medicine professor who received a Nobel in 2013; Eric Kandel, a biochemist and biophysicist at Columbia University and a 2000 Nobel Laureate; Aaron Ciechanover, distinguished research professor at Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and a 2004 Nobel recipient; and Jack Szostak, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School who received a Nobel in 2009.  Advertisement  Szostak said his role at Elysium Health is to scour scientific literature for new natural compounds that are shown to improve health and bring them to the company’s attention as potential ingredients in new products.  “What interests me in this is that it is a different challenge, to apply what we are learning through basic research, not just to curing disease but to keeping people healthy,” said Szostak, who runs a research lab at Massachusetts General Hospital. “If you go to Whole Foods or CVS, you see miles of dietary supplements and vitamins. Most of them have no scientific basis, and you don’t know what you are getting.”  Guarente was involved in several other efforts to develop antiaging medicines that did not pan out. He was a founder of Elixir Pharmaceuticals and then became involved with Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, which conducted research into the potential antiaging properties of a chemical found in red wine.  With Elysium, Guarente and his colleagues are entering an industry with a mixed reputation. At $25 billion annually and growing, vitamins and supplements are hugely popular among consumers. But the business has often been criticized by mainstream medicine for making ambitious claims about quick cures and miraculous health improvements that are not subjected to rigorous scientific scrutiny.  Advertisement  If Elysium Health were developing Basis as a drug, it would have to conduct clinical trials with humans to prove that it works, and the Food and Drug Administration would have to sign off on its scientific evidence before it could be sold as medicine.  But as a supplement, Basis and similar products only have to be shown to be safe for humans to take, with labels that are not misleading. With Basis, for example, there is no scientific evidence yet that the pill would produce the same beneficial effect in humans as in mice.  Indeed, one scientist not involved with Elysium questions the company’s marketing pitch, saying there is too little information to know what Basis can do.  “It is not quite clear to me what they want to target with this pill,” said Pere Puigserver, a biology professor at Harvard Medical School. “What does it mean, to improve metabolic health? And what exactly is being repaired in the body? And is the outcome the same for everyone?”  Puigserver, who runs a cancer biology lab at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, noted that addressing health and aging through metabolism involves a complex web of pathways and mechanisms.  “We need more information on how this works precisely in people before we can advise them to take anything,” he said.

The Pap test has already reduced the incidence of cervical cancer by more than 60%. Now it may become a key step in the early detection of two other gynecological malignancies — ovarian and endometrial cancers — that have been notorious killers because they’re typically caught so late.  A new study has found that by genetically analyzing the harvest of cells from a Pap smear, doctors could identify 81% of endometrial cancers and 33% of ovarian cancers. Some of those cancers were in their earliest stages, when they’re more likely to respond to treatment.  When the Johns Hopkins University researchers tested an alternative means of collecting cells — a longer brush that sweeps cells from the lining of the uterus — they positively identified endometrial cancer in 93% of cases and ovarian cancer in 45% of cases.  And when they added a blood test to the ovarian cancer screening regimen, they were able to detect that deadly cancer in 63% of patients who had it.  Advertisement  “Having the possibility to detect these cancers earlier is very exciting,” said Dr. Nickolas Papadopoulos, a coauthor of the study, which was published Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine.  It’s the latest example of how scientists hope to detect cancer earlier and with greater precision by looking in blood and other easily accessible fluids for cells that bear the telltale genetic mutations of cancer.  While such “liquid biopsies” have not yet made their way into widespread use, they hold the promise of revolutionizing cancer screening.  In January, the same research team presented promising findings in the journal Science on a blood test called CancerSEEK that’s capable of detecting malignancies of the liver, stomach, pancreas, esophagus, colon, lung and breast. Earlier this week, they published findings in the journal eLife on a urine test to detect cancers of the urothelial tract or urinary bladder.  Advertisement  As a screening test for cervical cancer, the Pap smear has been a staple of gynecological checkups for more than six decades. It’s named for Dr. George Papanicolaou, the physician who first showed that cancerous cells of the cervix could be detected by microscopic inspection.  The Pap test has dramatically driven down deaths from cervical cancer, which used to be one of the most common cancers in women. However, the test does a poor job of detecting endometrial or ovarian cancer, which together kills about 25,000 women in the United States each year.  Women thought to be at high risk of those cancers are sometimes screened with a blood test that detects an immune system biomarker called CA-125, or with a transvaginal ultrasound that looks for telltale thickening of the uterus’ endometrial wall. But those tests fail to detect many cancers, and also send up a lot of false alarms. So they’re frequently not used until a woman complains of symptoms.  The result is often a diagnosis at an advanced stage, when treatments are more invasive and less likely to be successful.  Tumor cells from ovarian and endometrial cancers shed and are carried into the uterine cavity and endocervical canal, where they can be collected with the Tao brush or the Pap brush. (Y. Wang et al. / Science Translational Medicine )  In the new study, the researchers measured the accuracy of their PapSeek test on 1,658 women. They already knew that 1,002 of the women were free of either cancer and 656 of them had either ovarian or endometrial cancer.  Researchers collected cervical fluid samples with a Pap smear brush and a slightly longer tool called a Tao brush, which reaches beyond the cervix and into the uterus, nearer to where ovarian and endometrial cancers take hold. Then they used the PapSeek test to sequence the samples, focusing on 18 genes that tend to develop mutations in those cancers. The test also checked the samples for aneuploidy, the presence of abnormal numbers of chromosomes in cells.  When the researchers used the longer Tao brush, they were able to detect endometrial cancer in all but 7% of the women who had the disease, and close to half of the ovarian cancers. Combined with the fact that these tests were performed with a mere swipe of the uterine wall, these measures of “sensitivity” — the ability to detect cancers that are actually there — represent a major improvement over the screening tests currently available.  Advertisement  When they supplemented the analysis of Pap and Tao brush samples with a hunt for mutated cells in the women’s blood, they were able to detect ovarian cancer in well over half of those who had it.  When endometrial and ovarian cancers are especially aggressive and when they have progressed to advanced stages, they are easier to find with existing screening methods. But an important measure of a test’s usefulness is whether it can detect the most aggressive types of cancer before they have metastasized.  By that measure too, the PapSeek test looked promising. When it was used to scan the Tao bru	0
Repairing a rotator cuff tear via surgery can be a tough decision for older people -- not every surgeon wants to fix their tears that way, believing it may lead to longer healing time or poor outcomes. But a new study shows that people older than age of 70 had good results after arthroscopic surgery of their rotator cuff tears.  The study, published recently online in Arthroscopy: The Journal of Arthroscopic and Related Surgery, looked at results two years after surgery among 39 people age 70 and older who had a full-thickness tear in their rotator cuff. The participants had already gone through more conservative treatment such as taking pain medication or undergoing a debridement, a procedure that removes dead or damaged tissue or foreign matter from an injured area.  Overall it was good news for patients afte rthe minimally invasive surgery: About 96% experienced significant pain reduction, and of the seven who were working before surgery, all returned to their jobs at pre-surgery levels.  Generally, range of motion improved substantially, as did muscle strength. The vast majority of patients said function had improved in their shoulders, and 94% said if they had to do it all over again they’d still have the surgery.  Advertisement  “In people over the age of 70, pain is the main issue, and pain relief is a fairly reliable outcome after surgery,” said Dr. Nikhil Verma, the study’s lead author, in a news release. Verma is an orthopedic surgeon at Rush Medical College in Chicago.  -- Jeannine Stein / Los Angeles Times	1
"June 7, 2011 - People with well-controlled type 1 diabetes had even better sugar control, used less insulin, and lost an average of 10 pounds in six months when taking the type 2 diabetes drug Victoza in a small clinical study.  Those who continued treatment for a full year continued these improvements and felt much better overall, says study leader Paresh Dandona, MD, of the State University of New York, Buffalo.  ""It is a dramatic change. They can see that their unexpected and unpredictable oscillations of blood sugar are minimized. They also lost weight,"" Dandona tells WebMD. ""Over a protracted period of time, as their diabetes continues to be well controlled, there is delightful improvement in patients' well-being.""  At the annual meeting of the Endocrine Society in Boston, Dandona reported the results of a study in which 14 adults, whose type 1 diabetes was well controlled with insulin given via an insulin pump, received once-daily Victoza for either one week or 24 weeks.  Continuous glucose monitoring showed that their blood sugar was as tightly controlled as possible with insulin treatment. Yet all patients' blood sugar peaked and dipped at unpredictable intervals.  Adding Victoza to insulin therapy quickly eliminated these peaks and dips in blood sugar. After one week, average fasting and weekly blood sugar levels each dropped by about 15%.  And during Victoza treatment, patients needed less and less insulin. Their average dose of mealtime insulin decreased by seven units (30%) and their need for all-day insulin dropped by eight units (32%).  Patients who continued treatment for 24 weeks had further decreases in insulin doses, and lost an average of 10 pounds. This appeared to be due to reduced appetite and food intake. Hemoglobin A1c levels dropped from 6.5% to a normal level of 6.1%.  ""Some patients have now been treated for up to a year, and the effect is as good as it was at the beginning,"" Dandona said at a news conference webcast from Boston."	0

LUNG CANCER BURDEN LUNG CANCER BURDEN The five-year survival rate is 16%. Source: American Cancer Society LIVING WITH CANCER FORUM LIVING WITH CANCER FORUM For readers, by readers: Patients, survivors, loved ones touched by any type of cancer invited to share questions, advice, experiences ON THE WEB ON THE WEB • Q&A on the National Lung Screening Trial • Fact Sheet on the NLST • More information on lung cancer and screening    • The full study, ""The National Lung Screening Trial: Overview and Study Design"" has been published by Radiology. For the first time, a large study shows that using CT scans to screen smokers and ex-smokers for lung cancer can reduce lung cancer deaths by 20% — potentially saving thousands of lives — by catching lethal tumors at an earlier, more treatable stage, according to a study released Thursday. Nearly 160,000 Americans a year die from lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer deaths in the world, according to the American Cancer Society. In addition to reducing lung cancer deaths, the screenings also reduced deaths from any cause by 7%, according to the National Cancer Institute, which funded the eight-year, $250 million study of 53,000 people older than 55. ""This is good news,"" says Bruce Johnson of Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, who wasn't involved in the study. ""The reduction in deaths is comparable to mammograms, which reduce deaths by 14% to 15%."" Q&A: Should smokers get scans now? Until now, there has never been a reliable way to catch lung cancers early, when doctors can save about 70% of patients. Today, about 75% of patients are diagnosed with incurable disease. Chest X-rays, an earlier form of screening tested repeatedly in the 1970s, has never been shown to save lives, says Ned Patz, a professor of radiology at Duke University Medical Center who helped design the trial. CT scans use a higher dose of radiation and are far more sensitive, able to pick up much smaller tumors. In this study, doctors randomly assigned half of patients to get three annual screenings with either a chest X-ray or a low-dose CT scan, the study says. Everyone in the study was a smoker or ex-smoker with 30 ""pack-years"" of smoking. That's equivalent of smoking a pack a day for 30 years or two packs a day for 15 years, for example. About 1.3% of those given CT scans died over five years, compared to 1.7% of those screened with chest X-rays, according to the National Cancer Institute. With 100 million smokers and ex-smokers in the USA, doctors acknowledge that the results may spur many people to ask for the scans. Any hospital can perform the scan, Johnson says. But Patz notes that doctors and healthcare leaders will have to look at the results carefully before recommending mass screenings. Avoiding smoking — which causes 87% of lung cancers — is still the best way to avoid smoking-related illness, which kills more than 400,000 Americans a year, Johnson says. But Johnson notes that most lung cancers today are diagnosed in people who don't smoke, either because they've already quit or have never used tobacco. Many worried ex-smokers will be relieved to hear there is something they can do to reduce their risk of death, he says. Researchers say they don't know if CT screenings help non-smokers or people younger than 55. NCI director Harold Varmus says his agency isn't making any recommendations. The American Cancer Society will consider the results, but also hasn't yet changed its recommendations, says chief medical officer Otis Brawley. ""Right now, no medical groups endorse screening for lung cancer. The best advice we can give is to encourage people to have conversations with their doctors about whether lung cancer screening is right for them,"" Brawley says. Brawley cautioned that screening's benefits in the real world may not be the same as in the study. Participants in the study were all ""highly motivated"" and informed patients living in large cities, treated through a careful program at major cancer centers, Brawley says. People who are screened at community hospitals without established systems for following up on suspicious screening results may not fare as well. Right now, neither Medicare nor private insurance companies pay for lung cancer screenings with CT scans, says Varmus. He noted that the Medicare program is going to look at the results to decide on coverage. In general, CT screenings cost about $300, Varmus says. About 25% of patients in the study screened with a CT needed follow-up tests, which add to the expense. Patz says patients should think carefully before requesting a screening. While CT scans are painless, they expose patients to radiation that can potentially cause new cancers, Patz says. It's possible that a person scanned frequently for lung cancer could develop breast cancer as a result"	0
About one in three couples struggling with infertility can trace their issues to poor quality semen, and men are given all kinds of advice about ways to produce healthier sperm. Among the most dispensed: eat a healthy diet, keep a healthy weight, avoid alcohol and tobacco and stay away from certain medications, such as blood pressure and depression drugs.  Now, researchers publishing in the journal Reproduction have found that another lifestyle change—exercise—may also help improve sperm quality.  In the study, Behzad Maleki at Justus-Liebig University in Germany and his colleagues recruited 280 sedentary, middle-aged men and randomly assigned them to one of three exercise regimens, or to no exercise, and followed them for six months. They wanted to see what effect different types of exercise, and different intensity activity, had on sperm quality and count. One group exercised at moderate levels continuously by walking or jogging on a treadmill, while another followed the same protocol but at a higher intensity. Another group did high intensity exercise on the treadmill but in short interval bouts.  Compared to the control group that didn’t exercise, all of the men who followed a physical activity program showed improvements in a variety of measures of their sperm. After six months, they showed less DNA damage, healthier sperm shape and lower levels of metabolic stress factors. They also showed higher numbers of sperm precursors.

View Sample Sign Up Now  “This fits reasonably well with what we thought about the effects of exercise,” says Dr. Peter Schlegel, vice president of the American Society of Reproductive Medicine and chairman of urology at New York Presbyterian/Weill Cornell Medical Center. “But this is a much better done study than almost anything that’s been done before on the subject.” He notes that most previous studies did not randomly assign people to exercise groups and compare the outcome on sperm quality, but rather recorded sperm measures among men who reported their exercise habits after the fact.  In the current study, the men in the moderate intensity, continuous activity program showed the most improvements compared to men in the other two more intense groups. While it’s not entirely clear why, part of the reason may have to do with the fact that extreme exercise generates body heat, which can be detrimental to sperm health; for marathoners and people training at intense levels, finding ways to dissipate body heat is a major concern. Schlegel also says that regular exercise can improve circulation and make the blood vessels healthier, which may benefit the testes, an organ that’s sensitive to and requires good blood flow.

LONDON (Reuters) - Giving the antidepressant drug Prozac to people who have just had a stroke could help them to regain more control over their movements and allow more of them to live independently, scientists said Monday.  The antidepressant drug Prozac, also known as fluoxetine, are seen on a table in Leicester, central England February 26, 2008 in this posed photograph. REUTERS/Darren Staples  In the largest study yet of the effect of this type of antidepressant on stroke recovery, French researchers found that stroke patients given Prozac improved their scores in motor skills tests more than those given a placebo, or dummy pill.  Experts commenting on the findings said they had “enormous potential to change clinical practice” and raised the question of whether most stroke patients with motor skill problems should be treated with this relatively cheap type of antidepressant.  Stroke is the single largest cause of adult disability and the third-largest cause of death in the developed world.  The cost of caring for its victims, who often have motor function difficulties like paralysis or weakness on one side, puts a heavy burden on already stretched healthcare systems.  A few previous small trials had already suggested that giving drugs like Prozac, which belongs to a drug class known as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), might improve motor skill recovery after stroke.  Prozac was developed by Eli Lilly and is now available in a cheaper generic form as fluoxetine.  Hemiplegia — paralysis to one side of the body — and hemiparesis — weakness on one side of the body — are the most common disabilities after stroke and scientists believe SSRIs might help improve movement by increasing the level of the brain chemical serotonin in the central nervous system.  “The positive effect of the drug on motor function... suggests that the neuronal ... action of SSRIs provides a new pathway that should be explored further,” said Francois Chollet of Toulouse University Hospital, who led this research.  In the study, conducted between March 2005 and June 2009 and published in The Lancet Neurology journal Monday, 118 patients in France were given either Prozac or a placebo for three months starting between five and 10 days after they had suffered a stroke.  All patients were also given physiotherapy, and had their motor skills tested at the start of the trial and on day 90.  Significantly greater improvements in motor function were recorded after three months in patients taking Prozac, where the average test score improved by 34.0 points, than in the placebo group, where the average improvement was 24.3 points.  There were also more independent patients and depression was less common in the Prozac group than in the placebo group, and side effects of the drug were rare and mild, researchers said.  Commenting on the study, Robert Robinson and Harold Adams from the University of Iowa in the United States, said it could change the way doctors treat stroke victims in future, but more research is needed to see if the effects continue over time.  Roger Bonomo, director of stroke care at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, said another way to look at the implications of this trial would be as justification for treatment of post-stroke depression before it progresses.  “Depression after stroke is a common enough complication to have raised the question of treating with antidepressants early after stroke,” he said in an emailed comment. “If motor function is also more likely to improve, then treating before symptoms of depression emerge is likely to be even more beneficial.	0
"Ten-year-old Alexis Carey has a rare but intractable form of epilepsy, Dravet Syndrome. The genetic disease causes severe and multiple seizures, which often leave parents guessing if the terror of watching their child seize up will pass or turn fatal.  Her Boise, Idaho, family learned that oil extracted from marijuana had helped other children and wanted to see if it would help Alexis too.  ""Parent to parent, when you're in a small community and 10 people that you know are all having success, that's no longer anecdotal,"" Clare Carey, her mother, said. ""That's hope.""  But Idaho's stringent marijuana laws do not allow for medicinal use. The family began lobbying lawmakers to decriminalize the oil almost two years ago. Now, they've got some legislative backers and an upcoming hearing, as Idaho joins a larger movement to loosen laws to allow the use of marijuana extract oil.  Twelve states have legalized the oil while still banning medical marijuana. Virginia legalized the oil Feb. 26. In Utah, lawmakers have given initial approval to let those with chronic and debilitating diseases consume edible marijuana products, while still banning smoking.  Marijuana extract oil first received attention when a Colorado family fought and won for access for their daughter who also had Dravet Syndrome. It is similar to hemp oil, which is legal in Idaho and can be bought in grocery stores.  With no known cure for Dravet Syndrome, children are often prescribed a cocktail of medications to counter the seizures. However, the heavy drugs often come with side-effects that can permanently damage a child's developing liver, kidneys and other organs.  Proponents of cannabidiol oil, a non-psychotropic extract of marijuana, argue that it reduces the amount and length of seizures in children.  Over time, Carey hopes that the oil would also reduce the number of medications her daughter relies on.  ""Like any parent, you never give up hope that you can get complete seizure control,"" she said. ""Children die from Dravet by any one of the seizures. Alexis could have a seizure that may not stop, we never really know.""  Alexis began having seizures when she was two months old. But even in 2003, her mom says a lack of awareness of the disease led to many doctors not automatically suspecting it could be a rare, genetic disorder.  It wasn't until Alexis lost all speech and potty control when she was 2 that doctors determined she had Dravet Syndrome, Carey said.  Since then, Alexis' parents have put her on a variety of diets and medications to help reduce the seizures but the disease is tricky to manage. Dravet Syndrome often causes a variety of different kinds of seizures but medications typically target one particular type.  Alexis' seizures usually occur at night, which means one of her parents regularly sleep with her and monitor her sleep patterns. During the day, Alexis requires constant supervision. While most 10-year-olds freely run and jump around, Alexis walks— albeit sometimes unstably and with help going up and down stairs.  Carey says working with Idaho's Republican-controlled Legislature has been easier than anticipated.  Lawmakers who resisted the idea at first blush have warmed up to the idea, she said.  This year, the bill is endorsed by Republicans Sen. Curt McKenzie and Rep. Tom Leortscher. Both are chairs of the legislature's State Affairs Committees, panels that often get tossed controversial legislation and have a high bar for clearance.  The measure unanimously passed the Senate committee during its introduction hearing, which means it now goes on to a full hearing in front of the committee.  Yet the bill must survive a Statehouse that approved a resolution in 2013 vowing never to legalize marijuana for any purpose."	1
"Enlarge By Muhammed Muheisen, AP Women practice tai chi in Beijing, China, June 27. Tai chi, sometimes known as ""shadow boxing,"" is a form of martial arts which combines slow graceful movements with meditation. HEALTH REPORTER TWEETS HEALTH REPORTER TWEETS Tai chi, an ancient Chinese practice of exercise and meditation, may relieve symptoms of a painful chronic condition called fibromyalgia, a small new study shows. Tai chi involves gentle, flowing movements in which students shift their weight and breathe deeply, cycling through a series of stances with poetic names, such as ""white crane spreads its wings."" The philosophy of tai chi involves moving a person's vital energy, or qi (""chee""), through the body. In the study, doctors randomly assigned 66 fibromyalgia patients to take either a 12-week tai chi class or attend a ""wellness education"" class that included stretching exercises, according to a study in today'sNew England Journal of Medicine. Fibromyalgia patients experience pain, stiffness, fatigue and other problems. 'CHI RUNNING': Athletes say it's injury-free ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE: Americans spend $34 billion a year All participants attended two hour-long classes a week and had instructions to practice at home 20 minutes a day. Most were women with an average age of 50, and most were overweight. After finishing the course, 79% of tai chi participants said their symptoms had improved, compared with 39% of those in the educational class, the study shows. It was financed by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, a branch of the National Institutes of Health. Tai chi students reported improvements in mood, sleep, quality of life and their ability to exercise. Even three months after the classes ended, 82% of tai chi students still felt better, compared with 53% of the comparison group, the study says. A study in 2007 from the National Institutes of Health found that 2.3 million American adults had used tai chi in the past year. In an accompanying editorial, Harvard Medical School's Gloria Yeh and others note that the study had limitations. Yeh notes that researchers don't know which aspects of tai chi were most helpful: the exercise, deep breathing, relaxation exercise, meeting new friends or learning from a charismatic teacher. Because all students knew which type of class they were taking, it's possible that tai chi could act like a placebo, so patients improved simply because they expected to. Yeh suggests conducting a larger, longer study — with multiple teachers, at different locations, perhaps comparing it with yoga and other therapies — to really understand tai chi's benefits. But Callahan notes that tai chi has few drawbacks. Even the cost of a class, which can top $50 a month, is modest compared with the cost of many medications. And unlike drugs, tai chi had no harmful side effects, she says. Guidelines: You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

"Dec. 1, 2011 (Chicago) -- An experimental treatment that involves spinal injections of ozone gas and steroids relieved pain in over two-thirds of 327 people with back problems related to a herniated disc.  This condition occurs when the cushions, or discs, that serve as shock absorbers for the spine become inflamed and bulge or break open. When inflamed, discs press against nearby nerves. People with this condition can experience pain, numbness, and weakness in the back, buttocks, and legs.  None of the people in this study had been helped by other nonsurgical therapies, and supporters say the new therapy could become a standard treatment for such patients. But a back pain specialist who spoke to WebMD says that further research is needed.  In the study, 119 people (37%) reported no pain at six months. About another third reported less frequent episodes of low back pain, ""maybe once a day,"" says researcher Thomas Lehnert, MD, an assistant professor of radiology at Frankfurt University in Germany.  Another 22% reported only a little improvement, with pain persisting. And 7% had no improvement or their pain got worse. A few patients resorted to back surgery.  Still, ozone therapy could even help many patients with unrelenting back pain to avoid surgery, Lehnert tells WebMD. Before the treatment, patients had tried everything without success and were considering an operation, he says.  Studies suggest that ozone therapy works by reducing inflammation, shrinking herniated discs, and relieving pressure on the nerves bringing pain signals to the brain. The steroid further reduces inflammation.  Lehnert presented the findings here at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America."	0
Photo  Can a cup of blueberries keep the doctor away? Maybe.  Researchers conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 40 postmenopausal women ages 45 to 65 with high blood pressure. Half ate 22 grams of freeze-dried blueberry powder (equivalent to a cup of blueberries) daily for eight weeks. The others consumed an identical-looking and tasting placebo.  The study, in The Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, found that those who ate the blueberry preparation saw an average 5.1 percent decrease in systolic blood pressure (the top number) and a 6.3 percent decrease in diastolic pressure. Levels of nitric oxide, known to be involved in relaxing and widening blood vessels, increased significantly in the blueberry eaters. There were no significant changes in the placebo group.  The improvement, the scientists write, was moderate compared with that of blood pressure medicines. But, they say, eating blueberries in larger amounts or for longer periods could increase the effect.  The lead author, Sarah A. Johnson, a postdoctoral researcher at Florida State University, said she saw no reason for people to radically change their diet, but that if they are not eating blueberries, they might want to try them. “There is something very special about the composition of blueberries that is responsible for their effect on blood pressure,” she said. “Other fruits and plant extracts have not produced the same result.”	1
NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Acupuncture may help relieve chronic back, joint and shoulder pain, according to a new review of the evidence - but some of its benefit is likely due to the “placebo effect,” researchers concluded.  A patient lies on a bed as he undergoes acupuncture treatment at Beijing's Capital Medical University Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital April 6, 2010. REUTERS/David Gray  In an analysis of 29 studies, they found people who got acupuncture typically reported more pain relief than those who didn’t.  But patients treated with fake or “sham” acupuncture - using retracting needles that don’t stick in the skin, for example - estimated their pain at somewhere in between the other two groups, suggesting that they also got some benefit from the procedure.  “A doctor who has a patient in pain has a lot of options,” such as medications and physical or talk therapy, said lead author Andrew Vickers, from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.  “This provides evidence that they would be justified in considering… acupuncture,” he told Reuters Health.  Acupuncture has been controversial among doctors as a possible treatment for a range of conditions including chronic pain and fibromyalgia.  Some think it has potential as an add-on or alternative to standard treatment, while others argue any acupuncture-related benefits are likely the result of hopeful patients getting treatment they strongly believe will help them.  That either means many of the three million Americans that get acupuncture every year are “wasting their time” - or others who forgo it are missing out on potential benefits, Vickers said.  To try to help sort out which is the case, he and his colleagues analyzed 29 studies they deemed to be high-quality comparisons of acupuncture, fake acupuncture and no treatment. Those trials included close to 18,000 patients in the United States and Europe with back and neck pain, shoulder pain, chronic headaches or joint pain due to osteoarthritis.  The researchers found that on average, people treated with acupuncture reported a “modest” improvement in symptoms compared to those who had sham treatment, and a larger effect compared to untreated patients.  They estimated in their Archives of Internal Medicine report that about 50 percent of patients had their symptoms cut in half with acupuncture, compared to almost 43 percent of those treated with sham acupuncture and 30 percent with no acupuncture-like therapy.  A typical acupuncture session runs for about $100 and is often not covered by health insurance.  USUALLY NOT THE FIRST STEP  “I have a long list of chronic pain patients coming to seek acupuncture,” said Jongbae Park, head of Asian Medicine & Acupuncture Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine.  It’s usually “not their first approach to address the condition,” he said - rather people seek acupuncture when traditional care fails to stop their pain.  Park, who was not involved in the new study, said acupuncture focuses on healing the underlying tissue injury that is causing pain, rather than treating the pain itself as medications would.  “I am a biased clinician,” Park told Reuters Health. But, he added, “I would sincerely say more than 75 percent of my patients will see improvement.”  Vickers said people who are considering acupuncture should first make sure their acupuncturist is appropriately qualified and licensed. In those cases, he said, acupuncture is very safe - and the main downsides are costs and the inconvenience of getting to a clinic.

"The FDA has approved a new flu medication in the form of a single-dose pill.  Interested in Flu Season? Add Flu Season as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Flu Season news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest  The medication, called XOFLUZA, was designed to make the flu shorter if taken within 48 hours of onset and can be prescribed to patients 12 and older once they've been diagnosed with the illness, according to the FDA.  The new medication is designed to significantly reduced the duration of flu symptoms by more than one day, when compared to a placebo in clinical trials, the FDA said.  Researchers believe the medication will prevent patients from spreading the flu, which could help reign in contagion rates following the 2017-2018 flu season, which saw 900,000 hospitalizations and 80,000 deaths -- the deadliest season in four decades, according to the FDA. The medication was approved under a priority review.  The medication is the first in a new class of antiviral medications that blocks an enzyme within the flu virus, which stops viral replication early in the influenza cycle, the FDA announced.  STOCK PHOTO/Getty Images  XOFLUZA is similar to Oseltamivir, also known under the brand name Tamiflu, but ""decreases viral shedding faster"" and is associated with less side effects, Dr. Todd Ellerin, the infectious disease specialist at South Shore Hospital in Massachusetts, told ABC News.  ""Like Tamiflu, it seems to work better the quicker it gets into the patient,"" Ellerin said.  In clinical trials, XOFLUZA demonstrated efficacy against a wide range of influenza, including Tamiflu-resistant strains, and has also proved effective against some strains of Asian bird flu, such as H5N1, according to the FDA.  The medication is the ""first new flu medicine"" of its kind -- with a novel proposed mechanism -- in nearly 20 years, said Dr. Sandra Horning, chief medical officer and head of global product development at Genentech, the company selling the pill in the U.S., in a statement to ABC News.  ""If patients see their doctors within 48 hours of symptom onset, one dose of XOFLUZA can significantly reduce the duration of flu symptoms,"" Horning said.  STOCK PHOTO/Getty Images  Since it was tested in healthy, adult patients, it is unclear how effective it will be in the most severe cases or for the most vulnerable patients, Ellerin said.  The pill will be available across the U.S. in the coming weeks, according to the FDA."	1
"""I was a skeleton when I walked out. ... But I walked out being told they couldn't find any cancer cells in my body. When you've already accepted your fate, to have it 180 degrees changed, it's unnerving."" - Bill Ludwig, 70, Penn’s first T-cell patient. DAVID MAIALETTI / Staff Photographer  Four years ago, University of Pennsylvania researchers published early but electrifying results. An experimental T-cell therapy eradicated end-stage leukemia in two patients, and put a third in remission. Soon after that, pharmaceutical giant Novartis partnered with Penn, aiming to commercialize the breakthrough. Since then, a more modest picture of success has emerged in treating the blood cancer, a type called chronic lymphocytic leukemia that usually strikes in middle age or later. Of the first 14 CLL patients given the T-cell therapy, four had their cancers disappear - including the first two, who are now about five years cancer-free. Four others got better but then their cancer progressed. And six had no response to the T-cell therapy.  In addition to those results, published last week in Science Translational Medicine, the Penn team has orally presented data for a total of 38 CLL patients.  Cancer disappeared in nine (24 percent), and temporarily regressed in another nine.  CLL typically progresses more slowly than other types of leukemia, and may be held in check for years with chemotherapy.  In comparison, Penn's T-cell therapy has been spectacularly effective in more than 50 children and adults with a fast-progressing type of blood cancer called acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Long-lasting, complete remissions have occurred in more than 60 percent of patients.  Other major centers that are developing T-cell therapies, including Memorial Sloan Kettering and the National Cancer Institute, also have found that the approach works far better in ALL than CLL.  The method is complex and costly, and often triggers life-threatening complications. It involves genetically engineering each patient's disease-fighting T cells to recognize and attack their cancer cells.  When it works, the therapy also offers the hope of a rarity in terminal-stage cancer: a onetime curative treatment. Stem-cell transplantation, a risky, last-resort treatment that can sometimes be curative, is not a suitable option for most patients with CLL.  ""The field of CLL is exploding now,"" said Penn leukemia specialist David L. Porter, the director of blood and bone marrow transplantation. ""At the very limit of this [T-cell] treatment, one could consider it like a stem-cell transplant. It's a highly technical approach, but it clearly has a role for a select group of patients. There is something very attractive about a once-and-done therapy.""  Walter J. Urba, director of research at Providence Cancer Center in Portland, Ore., wrote an editorial four years ago cautioning that only wider testing would show whether Penn's ""impressive"" initial results were ""an authentic advance"" for CLL.  Last week, Urba said Penn's T-cell therapy ""remains very exciting,"" despite the costs and toxic side effects.  ""Everything we do in oncology is a risk-benefit balance,"" Urba said. ""I suspect that over time we'll have better T-cell therapies, maybe given with other immune therapies.""  Indeed, Penn and other centers have begun testing next-generation T cells in more blood malignancies including lymphomas, and against the ultimate biological challenge - solid tumor cancers.  For Penn's very first T-cell patient, Bill Ludwig, 70, the pace of progress is thrilling, humbling, and yet, a bit of a letdown.  The retired corrections officer from Bridgeton, N.J., was losing his decadelong battle with CLL when he agreed to try the novel therapy in August 2010.  ""I didn't hesitate because I had no options left,"" he recalled last week. ""And also, these people at Penn had been so wonderful to me and my family for 10 years. I felt obligated to say yes. Did I ever think it would be successful? Not in a million years.""  He suffered catastrophic side effects as his immune system went into overdrive and his body struggled to eliminate seven pounds worth of dead cancer cells.  ""I was in intensive care, with all my major organs shutting down,"" he said. ""My lower extremities were twice the size they should have been. They called my wife and said, 'He's not going to see the sunrise.' ""  They were wrong.  ""I was a skeleton when I walked out"" a month later, he said. ""But I walked out being told they couldn't find any cancer cells in my body. When you've already accepted your fate, to have it 180 degrees changed, it's unnerving.""  Ludwig and his wife have since bought a recreational vehicle and traveled the country, seen grandchildren graduate high school, and welcomed three great-grandchildren.  Still, he can't help feeling disappointed that the phenomenal early success of the therapy was just that.  ""When two out of three are successful, you think maybe it will be 9 out of 10, or 19 out of 20. I figur"	0
Adding small amounts of powdered ginger to food may help take the edge off seasonal allergy symptoms, according to an animal study published online in the Journal of Nutritional Biochemistry. Daily intake of dried ginger significantly reduced sneezing and other signs of allergy in rodents with induced allergic rhinitis, or hay fever.  A major component in ginger, 6-gingerol, suppresses the activation of T lymphocytes, or T cells, a type of white blood cell that plays an important role in sensitizing people to specific allergens, the researchers said.  Ginger is a popular spice produced from the root of the ginger plant, Zingiber officinale. Some herbal remedies for nausea and other ailments also contain ginger.  Experiments in Japan involved mice fed a normal diet containing 2% powdered ginger or a control diet without ginger. After two weeks on the diets, the ginger-fed mice received two injections of purified egg proteins called ovalbumin (OVA) to stimulate allergic rhinitis symptoms. Control mice received either OVA or placebo injections.  The mice underwent an immune challenge two weeks later in which a small amount of OVA was inserted into the nose. Allergic symptoms, such as sneezing and nasal rubbing, were counted for the next 10 minutes.  Mice in the ginger-fed group sneezed 2.1 times each, on average. This compares with 15.2 sneezes per mouse in the OVA-injected controls and roughly one sneeze in the placebo-injected animals. Fewer nasal rubbing movements were recorded in the ginger-fed mice compared with OVA-injected controls, but not the placebo group.  Ginger-fed mice had lower levels of immunoglobulin E, or IgE, a type of allergic antibody, and mast cells, which release chemicals called histamines that cause sneezing and other allergic symptoms, the study showed. T cells stimulate the production of IgE to specific allergens. IgE binds to receptors on mast cells, triggering the release of histamine.  The study used powdered ginger, the type used in cooking, containing 0.5% 6-gingerol. Previous studies suggest powdered ginger contains higher concentrations of 6-gingerol than fresh ginger, researchers said.  Caveat: The antiallergic effects of ginger may vary with the 6-gingerol content, researchers said. Ginger has not been tested on people with allergic rhinitis.

"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Older people who use olive oil in their cooking and on their salads may have a lower risk of suffering a stroke, researchers reported Wednesday.  Olive oils are seen at ""Barcelona Degusta"" the 3rd edition of the consumer food show in Barcelona March 6, 2009. REUTERS/Albert Gea  In a study that followed older French adults for five years, researchers found that those who regularly used olive oil were 41 percent less likely to have a stroke than those who never used the oil.  The findings, reported in the journal Neurology, hint that the well-known connection between olive oil and heart disease might extend to stroke as well. Olive oil is a key ingredient in the so-called Mediterranean diet. And some clinical trials have suggested that the diet helps control risk factors for heart disease, like high blood pressure, abdominal obesity and elevated levels of “bad” LDL cholesterol.  High olive oil intake is also linked to a lower risk of heart attack, and a longer lifespan among heart attack survivors. These latest findings support the general advice that people replace dubious dietary fats — namely, saturated fats and “trans” fats — with olive oil and other unsaturated fats, according to an expert not involved in the study. But he also stressed that the study does not prove that olive oil, per se, helps prevent strokes.  “We need to remember that this is an observational study,” said Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, a neurologist at Columbia University Medical Center in New York who wrote an editorial published with the study.  The study found a correlation between people’s olive oil use and their stroke risk, he told Reuters Health — but that doesn’t necessarily translate into cause-and-effect.  “People who use a lot of olive oil may be very different from people who don’t,” Scarmeas said.  Olive oil users may, for example, have higher incomes, eat better overall or exercise more often than people who never use the oil. The researchers on the new study, led by Cécilia Samieri of the French national research institute INSERM, tried to account for those differences. And after they did, olive oil was still linked to a lower stroke risk.  But it’s impossible to fully account for all those variables, Scarmeas noted. What’s needed, he said, are clinical trials where people are randomly assigned to use olive oil or not, then followed over time to see who suffers a stroke. Such clinical trials are considered the “gold standard” of medical evidence.  The current study included 7,625 French adults age 65 and older who reported on their diets and other lifestyle factors. People who said they used olive oil for both cooking and as a dressing were considered “intensive users.”  Over the next five to six years, those intensive users suffered strokes at a rate of 0.3 percent per year. That compared with just over 0.5 percent among non-users, and 0.4 percent among moderate users.  When the researchers factored in other diet habits, exercise levels and major risk factors for stroke — like high blood pressure and diabetes — heavy olive oil use was tied to 41 percent reduction in the odds of stroke.  Samieri’s team also took blood samples from another 1,245 older adults, measuring their levels of oleic acid — a monounsaturated fat that accounts for most of the fatty acids in olive oil. The one-third of participants with the highest oleic acid levels were 73 percent less likely to suffer a stroke than the one-third with the lowest levels.  The findings, according to Scarmeas, argue for more research into olive oil’s potential benefits against not only heart disease, but stroke and other neurological diseases as well.  For now, he suggested that people choose olive oil and other unsaturated fats over saturated fats (found largely in meat and dairy) and trans fats (found in some processed foods, like crackers, cookies and chips).  “It’s better to rely on this type of fat for your overall health,” Scarmeas said.  That said, no single food is consumed in isolation, he points out in his editorial. Olive oil is one part of the Mediterranean diet that has been tied to heart benefits. The diet also boasts plenty of fruits and vegetables, legumes, whole grains, fish and moderate amounts of red wine.  SOURCE: bit.ly/SUxCM Neurology, online June 15, 2011."	0
"En Español  MONDAY, May 25, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Too few women at high risk for osteoporosis are being tested for the bone-depleting condition, while too many women at low-risk are being screened, a new study suggests.  A team led by Dr. Anna Lee Amarnath of the University of California, Davis, examined the medical records of nearly 51,000 women, aged 40 to 85, living in the Sacramento area.  The researchers looked at whether or not women were getting a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) test, which measures bone mineral density.  The result: Osteoporosis screening rates jumped sharply at age 50, despite guidelines suggesting that screening only begin at age 65, unless a woman has certain risk factors.  However, the study also found that those risk factors -- a small body frame, a history of fractures, or taking medications that could thin bones -- had only a slight effect on a woman's decision to get her bones tested.  Over seven years, more than 42 percent of eligible women aged 65 to 74 were not screened, Amarath's team found, nor were nearly 57 percent of those older than 75.  However, nearly 46 percent of low-risk women aged 50 to 59 were screened, as were 59 percent of low-risk women aged 60 to 64.  The study was published online May 19 in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.  ""DXA screening was underused in women at increased fracture risk, including women aged 65 years and older. Meanwhile, it was common among women at low fracture risk, such as younger women without osteoporosis risk factors,"" Amarnath said in a journal news release.  What to do? Reminder notes to doctors and patients might help, one expert said.  ""Health systems should invest in developing electronic health records systems that prompt providers at the point-of-care when screening is needed and when it can be postponed,"" study senior author Joshua Fenton, an associate professor of family and community medicine at UC Davis, said in the news release.

"latimes.com/health/la-he-skeptic-telomeres-20101220,0,5791340.story  By Chris Woolston, Special to the Los Angeles Times  December 20, 2010  Advertisement  We all know what aging looks like from the outside: wrinkled skin, gray hair, a growing need to turn up the volume on ""Jeopardy."" But in recent years, scientists have made some breakthrough discoveries about how we age on the inside, right down to our genes. The science of aging has created a glimmer of hope that we could someday slow the process — a dream that has already spread beyond the lab to the marketplace.    Anti-aging research used to be mainly about finding new ways to get lab mice to take their vitamins. But if you visited a lab today, you'd be more likely to hear scientists talking excitedly about telomeres, protective strands of DNA at the end of chromosomes that seem to play an important — some would say crucial — role in aging.    Whenever a healthy cell divides, the telomeres get a little shorter. In fact, you could tell a lot about the age of a person simply by looking at the length of his or her telomeres. Studies have found that in people older than 60, short telomeres are one sign that the end may be relatively near: Older people with short telomeres seem to be especially vulnerable to disease, including heart disease and infections. But telomeres aren't as reliable as a clock or even a tree ring. Recent studies suggest that you can help your telomeres stay relatively long and youthful if you get regular exercise, eat a healthful diet and avoid stress.    At a time when people are willing to spend big bucks to look and feel younger, it's not surprising that telomeres have become a buzzword in the supplement industry. One expensive option, TA-65, supposedly works by stimulating telomerase, a natural enzyme that helps restore telomeres after a cell divides. (The TA stands for ""telomerase activator."")    Created by Geron Corp., a biotech research company, TA-65 contains extracts of astragalus, an herb often used as an immunity-booster in traditional Chinese medicine. Although TA-65 is legally classified as a dietary supplement, TA Sciences, the company that bought the licensing rights from Geron, makes it available only through select doctors who have paid a fee and have passed a test on telomere biology. Seven doctors offer TA-65 in California, including two in Los Angeles, according to the company website.    When TA-65 was first released in 2007, patients spent $25,000 a year on the supplement and accompanying tests. Now patients spend $1,200 to $4,000 for a six-month supply, depending on the dose. The company recommends taking the supplement for two years. Patients must spend an additional $500 on doctor's fees, and they have the option of spending several hundred to a couple of thousand dollars more on tests to check the results.    Reneuve, a supplement sold online, supposedly lengthens telomeres by giving users an extra-large dose of telomerase. You won't see telomerase in the list of ingredients, but Reneuve does offer ""select proprietary glandular extracts"" from pig thymuses that provide ""enough telomerase enzyme for the cellular infrastructure of one adult.""    A single 30-milliliter vial of Reneuve purchased through the company website costs $250. Users are instructed to drink the vial in a single sitting, perhaps with some Mountain Dew or Gatorade. The effects are said to last six months.    Claims    The TA Science website says the company ""is the first and only … in the world to offer Telomerase-Activating products to combat the effects of aging through leading-edge science."" Company founder Noel Patton says, ""Our product is not the fountain of youth. You won't miraculously turn into a 20-year-old again. But it is a fountain of youth for certain cells.""    Specifically, Patton says, the product will ""strengthen and rejuvenate"" the immune system. He points to an unpublished company-run study that compared an astragalus supplement similar to TA-65 to a placebo in 36 men ages 60 to 85. The study reportedly found that men who took the supplement for six months developed stronger immune system cells, better eyesight, improved sexual satisfaction and younger-looking skin. He also says that tests paid for by patients show that the supplement improves bone density, cognitive function, cholesterol levels and control of blood sugar.    The Reneuve website says the product uses "" Nobel Prize-winning technology to supply immune-system enhancing and anti-aging enzymes to the body."" It also says that, thanks to Reneuve, ""aging is now a choice, not a fact."" Rasjesh Sharma, the chief scientific officer of Reneuve, declined to be interviewed but said in an e-mail that the supplement helps replace the telomerase that people make naturally until they turn 25.    The bottom line    Dr. Richard Cawthon, who studies the link between telomeres and disease at the University of Utah School of Medicine in Salt Lake City, says he would love to take "	0
"A large, new study may be reassuring to women considering mastectomies because of a history of breast cancer in their families.  Stanford University researchers affirmed that women with mothers and sisters who carry one of the BRCA gene mutations but who aren't carriers themselves don't have an especially heightened risk of breast cancer.  The findings run counter to an influential 2007 study, which found that such women could have as much as a five-fold higher risk of developing the disease as the general population, even if they tested negative for the two genetic mutations known as BRCA1 and BRCA2.  That report raised concerns among doctors and patients alike that a negative BRCA test didn't necessarily mean women had escaped the risk associated with the mutations, which significantly raise a woman's risk of breast and ovarian cancer. Some women who test positive opt for prophylactic surgery to remove their breasts or ovaries.  ""Women who test negative for BRCA don't require excessive interventions just because BRCA is in the family,"" said Allison Kurian, an assistant professor of both medicine and health research and policy at Stanford and lead author of the study.  The findings, published online Monday by the Journal of Clinical Oncology, are based on an analysis of 3,047 families, including 292 with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, enrolled in a breast-cancer family registry. Researchers said it was the largest study yet undertaken to assess breast-cancer risk among non-carriers of inheritable mutations.  The results support current guidelines that say non-BRCA mutation carriers in families affected by the BRCA genes don't need special screening beyond mammography as recommended for the general population, and needn't consider preventive surgery.  The BRCA mutations are associated with a five-fold risk of getting breast cancer and a 20-fold risk of ovarian cancer compared with people without the mutations, according to the National Cancer Institute. The chance that women who inherent the genes will get breast cancer during their lives is 45% to 65%; the likelihood is 11% to 40% for ovarian cancer.  The heightened risk has prompted women whose mothers or sisters were diagnosed with BRCA-positive tumors to get tested themselves, with the assumption that a negative test meant their chances of developing the cancers was low.  That's why the 2007 study was so troubling. It ""cast doubt on the whole meaning of a negative test result,"" Dr. Kurian said. ""We all see genetic tests as giving relatives an out when it's negative.""  Dr. Kurian said the earlier study had methodological flaws that may have led to an overestimate of risk for non-BRCA carriers.  Several other published studies have subsequently contradicted the 2007 findings. Monday's study, though, is special because it is population-based, not based on patients going to a clinic. Therefore it has a broader representation of mutation-carrying families, said Mark Robson, clinic director of the clinical genetics service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. Dr. Robson, who wasn't an involved in the study but his team did a study that also contradicted the 2007 research, wrote an editorial accompanying it.  Eric Winer, chief of the division of women's cancers at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston who wasn't involved in the current research, said the study shows that for women in families with an inherited breast-cancer gene but who don't inherit it, the risk of developing cancer does not appear to be significantly increased. They may still face a slightly elevated risk because they have a family member with the disease.  Write to Ron Winslow at ron.winslow@wsj.com and Shirley S. Wang at shirley.wang@wsj.com"	0
"By MARIA CHENG, AP Medical Writer  LONDON (AP) — If you spend all day sitting on your rear end, then you might want to schedule some time for a brisk walk — just make sure you can spare at least an hour.  Scientists analyzing data from more than 1 million people found that it takes about 60 to 75 minutes of ""moderate intensity"" exercise to undo the damage of sitting for at least eight hours a day. Not exercising and sitting all day is as dangerous as being obese or smoking, they found.  And the added risk of parking yourself in front of a television for 5 hours or more a day after sitting at the office is so high even the hour of exercise is not enough to reverse the damage.  ""We cannot stress enough the importance of getting exercise, whether it's getting out for a walk at lunchtime, going for a run in the morning or cycling to work,"" said Ulf Ekelund of the Norwegian School of Sports Sciences in Norway, one of the study authors, in a statement.  It has been long suspected that sitting a lot, at work or at home, is not healthy. Previous studies have found that prolonged sitting can raise the chances of heart disease, various cancers and an earlier death.  In the new research , experts combed through 13 papers with data on factors including how long people spend sitting, their physical activity levels and their television-watching habits. The majority of studies included people older than age 45. All except one were done in the U.S., Western Europe and Australia.  Researchers found that people with the highest levels of moderate physical activity — 60 to 75 minutes daily— erased the higher risk of death linked to being seated for more than eight hours a day. But even that exercise regime was not enough to counter the hazards of also watching more than five hours of television a day.  The paper was published online Wednesday in the journal Lancet.  Lars Bo Andersen, who co-authored an accompanying commentary, called the new research ""very convincing,"" explaining that too much sitting increases the risk of problems including diabetes and heart disease because it can make insulin levels spike and might slow the body's metabolism.  Andersen said that watching lots of television was probably even worse than sitting at the office all day because it likely includes other unhealthy habits.  ""A lot of people don't just watch TV, they eat fatty snacks at the same time,"" said Andersen, of Sogn and Fjordane University College in Norway.  Andersen said that some cultures make it easier than others to squeeze in an hour of exercise every day, noting that in Denmark and much of Scandinavia, about half of all people either cycle or walk to work. But he said that getting the recommended amount of physical activity shouldn't be overly arduous and doesn't necessarily mean going to the gym for an intense work-out.  ""If you are walking and can feel yourself getting a little warm and your breathing is a little heavier, that's enough,"" he said. ""You don't have to be sweaty and out of breath to get the benefits."""	0
"By Steven Reinberg  HealthDay Reporter  WEDNESDAY, July 14, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- A weight-loss pill called lorcaserin not only helps people drop pounds but does so with few side effects, new industry-funded research reports.  A potential player in fighting the obesity epidemic, lorcaserin is a new type of weight-loss drug that works by acting on serotonin, a chemical associated with feelings of well-being and feeling full, and does not appear to increase blood pressure or cause any other heart problems, according to the researchers, whose work was sponsored by the drug manufacturer.  ""In this long-term study of lorcaserin for treating patients for obesity, there was good weight loss, outstanding safety profile and the drug was extremely well-tolerated,"" said lead researcher Dr. Steven Smith from the Translational Research Institute for Metabolism and Diabetes in Winter Park, Fla.  ""As patients are looking for additional options and physicians are looking for new tools, [lorcaserin] provides us with a look into the future for what's going to be available for helping patients lose weight,"" he added.  The report is published in the July 15 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, and was sponsored by Arena Pharmaceuticals, of San Diego, Calif., which used its own doctors as part of the study group.  The drug is one of three new anti-obesity drugs being considered for approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. On Thursday, an FDA advisory panel is expected to review Qnexa, made by Vivus, from a combination of phentermine and topiramate. It helped patients in clinical trials lose as much as 13 percent to 15 percent of body weight.  FDA briefing documents posted online Tuesday acknowledged Qnexa's effectiveness in helping patients lose weight, but said the review panel should take into account a number of potential nervous system and psychiatric side effects, the Associated Press reported.  The third new drug is Orexigen Therapeutic's Contrave, which is a combination of the antidepressant Wellbutrin and the addiction drug naltrexone.  For the lorcaserin study, Smith's team randomly assigned 3,182 obese or overweight people to lorcaserin or placebo. Patients took lorcaserin twice a day for a year and also took part in diet and exercise counseling.  After one year, 47.5 percent of those taking lorcaserin had lost 5 percent or more of their body weight. ""That's about 20 pounds,"" Smith said.  Among those taking the placebo, only 20.3 percent had achieved that amount of weight loss, the researchers found.  After the first year, people taking lorcaserin were randomized to lorcaserin or placebo for an additional year. Among people who stayed on lorcaserin, 67.9 percent were able to maintain the weight loss they had seen in the first year. Among those who were switched to a placebo, 50.3 percent were able to maintain their weight loss, Smith's group reported.  Smith's team noted that for those taking lorcaserin, there was no increase in heart valve problems as had been seen with the discredited diet drug Fen-Phen. However, common side effects included headache, dizziness and nausea.  Dr. Arne Astrup, from the department of human nutrition at the University of Copenhagen in Denmark and author of an accompanying journal editorial, said that ""the trial on lorcaserin provides evidence of a safe weight-loss medication, that seems to provide benefits in terms of reducing risk of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.""  Also, it does not have the same problems as the previous weight-loss drugs, Fen-Phen (Phentermine), Acomplia (rimonabant) or Meridia (sibutramine), which had been associated with heart problems, he said.  ""If weight-loss drugs are tailor-made to hit only the right receptor, based on physiological knowledge, it seems to be possible to develop weight-loss medications that do not possess any serious adverse effects,"" Astrup added.  However, one expert was not sold on this new drug.  ""What's most impressive about this two-year clinical trial is how unimpressive it is,"" said Dr. David L. Katz, director of the Prevention Research Center at Yale University School of Medicine.  Nearly half of the people dropped out in the first year, he pointed out, and by year two, more than half the remainder had also dropped out.  ""Among those who remained, lorcaserin produced relatively modest weight loss when combined with diet and exercise counseling, and that weight loss was maintained in over half of the participants only so long as they kept taking the drug. And the paper made no mention of the costs attached to long-term pharmacotherapy,"" Katz added.  ""This close look at lorcaserin reaffirms that better daily use of feet and forks holds far greater promise for meaningful, sustainable and affordable weight control than pharmacotherapy,"" Katz said.  According to the Associated Press, lorcaserin will be reviewed by an FDA panel in September, and Contrave will be reviewed in December.  More information  For m"	0
WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A drug approved to treat a range of conditions may also work to prevent lung cancer in people who have given up smoking, U.S. researchers reported on Tuesday.  The drug, called iloprost, is approved in inhaled forms to treat pulmonary hypertension, when blood pools near the lungs, a connective tissue disease called scleroderma and a nerve condition called Raynaud’s phenomenon.  Dr. Robert Keith of the Denver Veterans Affairs Medical Center and colleagues tested an oral version to see if it might prevent lung cancer in smokers and former smokers.  “Oral iloprost showed promise for preventing lung cancer in former, but not current, smokers in a phase II clinical trial,” they wrote in a summary presented to a meeting of the American Thoracic Society in New Orleans.  Iloprost is a version of prostacyclin, a drug in the prostaglandin class that prevents lung cancer in mice.  Keith, who has been testing several drugs to prevent lung cancer, looked at biopsies taken from the lungs of 125 current and former smokers.  They treated half with placebo and half with iloprost, and then performed bronchoscopy examinations to assess precancerous changes in the lungs.  Six months later, “former smokers showed significant improvements on all measures, indicating that treatment with iloprost may reduce the risk of developing lung cancer among former smokers,” the researchers said.  “Interestingly, current smokers did not show any significant improvements,” they added.  “Oral iloprost significantly improves endobronchial dysplasia in former smokers and deserves further study to determine if it can prevent the development of lung cancer.”  ITALIAN RESEARCH  Swiss drug maker Actelion markets inhaled iloprost under the brand name Ventavis.  It is also sold in an intravenous form under the trade name Ilomedin by Schering, acquired by Merck.  In April, researchers said a natural supplement derived from food, called myo-inositol, seems to stop the precancerous changes that lead to lung cancer.  Cigarette smoke causes 90 percent of all cases of lung cancer, which kills 1.2 million people a year globally. But only about 10 percent of smokers ever develop lung cancer, although they often die of other causes like heart disease, stroke or emphysema.  Separately, Italian researchers reported that advanced lung cancer patients given the targeted therapy drug Tarceva as so-called maintenance treatment — after they finished a course of standard chemotherapy — lived a little bit longer.  Federico Cappuzzo from Ospedale Civile di Livorno in Italy and colleagues did a phase 3 trial in 889 patients who had already had chemotherapy and whose tumors had not come back.  They received either Tarceva, a drug sold by Roche and OSI Pharmaceuticals and known generically as erlotinib, or a placebo until they got worse or died.  The patients who got Tarceva lived a little longer without their tumors growing — 12 weeks versus 11 weeks on average and they lived a month longer on average — 12 months versus 11 months.  This was seen even among patients who did not have the EGFR genetic mutation that Tarceva targets, they reported in Lancet Oncology.  Fewer than half of all lung cancer patients who do well after a first course of chemotherapy get more treatment, but the Italian group said their study shows this is worth doing.	1
"(CNN) Australian researchers have developed an experimental blood test they say is the first blood test capable of detecting melanoma -- an aggressive form of skin cancer -- in its early stages with a high degree of accuracy.  The test could speed up the diagnosis process, saving thousands of lives.  Scientists at Edith Cowan University in Western Australia tested blood samples for the antibodies typically created by the immune system in response to melanoma and identified them with significant accuracy.  Antibodies ""are easily accessible in the blood, so it provides a fantastic test to identify an early-stage cancer,"" said project lead Professor Mel Ziman, leader of the university's Melanoma Research Group on Monday.  In the study , published Tuesday in the journal Oncotarget, Ziman's team screened 245 blood samples from both melanoma patients and healthy volunteers. The researchers were able to identify people with melanoma with 79% accuracy and people without a melanoma with 84% accuracy.  ""In order for it to be valued by clinicians we would need to get to 90% accuracy in detection,"" she said. ""So we are doing a clinical trial with 1000 participants to refine our test to get to this point.""  If further trials are successful, Ziman estimates the test could be distributed internationally in up to five years.  Patients who returned a positive result would still need a biopsy to confirm the blood test and determine how far the cancer had developed, Ziman said.  Multiple groups worldwide are working to develop blood tests that detect a range of cancers. A recent study showed promise for a test detecting tumors of the ovary, liver, stomach, pancreas, esophagus, colorectum, lung and breast, while another study claimed to detect 10 cancers, including 90% accuracy for ovarian cancer.  The Australian team believe theirs would be the first to detect melanoma.  'In the wrong place with the wrong skin color'  Melanoma cancers are dangerous, abnormal growths on the surface of the skin caused by sun damage, which can spread throughout the body if left untreated.  A melanoma skin cancer.  The problem is particularly serious in Australia, where melanomas were the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer in 2017 and cause about 1,700 deaths a year, according to the university.  This is in large part due to high levels of UV exposure caused by the region's proximity to the ozone hole over the Antarctic.  ""We're in the wrong place with the wrong skin color. We've had a lot of migrants from European nations, so they're fair-skinned ... and we do have a very intense sun here,"" Ziman said.  If detected early, skin cancers have a survival rate as high as 95%, the research team said, but it drops to just 50% if diagnosed late.  Surgery to remove the growth is the most common form of treatment.  Simpler detection  Ziman said current methods of melanoma detection are expensive and invasive, involving a trip to a clinician, who must biopsy the lesion to discover whether it is cancerous.  For potential sufferers in remote areas, away from skin specialists, diagnosis can be especially tricky, he said, making a simple blood test an easy alternative to identify those at risk.  Over three years, the research team identified a combination of 10 types of antibodies that best signal the presence of a melanoma.  Antibodies are the products of the body's immune system, created to battle not only bacteria and viruses but abnormal cancer cells, Ziman said.  Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.  Dr. Jodie Moffat, head of early diagnosis at Cancer Research UK, agreed that a test which finds melanoma earlier could help reduce deaths from the disease, adding that ""melanoma can be more than skin deep, and it's much harder to treat when diagnosed at a late stage after it has spread.""  However, she stressed the fact this new test has not undergone clinical trials.  ""We need to know how accurate it is, if it can save lives, and how it could work in practice. So, although a blood test to find skin cancer earlier is certainly exciting, research in this field still has hurdles to overcome,"" she said.  In the meantime, ""people can help spot skin cancer early by knowing what's normal for their skin,"" said Moffat. In turn people should talk to a health professional about any ""unusual or lasting changes to a mole, freckle or normal patch of skin."""	0
COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Merck & Co scored a double hit on Sunday with new clinical data showing its Keytruda immunotherapy offered big benefits in previously untreated lung cancer patients, either when given on its own or with chemotherapy.  As a monotherapy, Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy alone in pre-selected patients whose tumors had been tested using a biomarker.  And when given with two older chemotherapy drugs in non-selected patients, it was almost twice as likely to shrink tumors as chemotherapy alone.  Another similar drug from Roche also demonstrated broad efficacy as a so-called second-line option in patients who had received prior treatment.  “Remember this day. It’s a new day for lung cancer treatment,” Stefan Zimmermann of Lausanne’s University Hospital told reporters at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress as the results were presented.  An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where the Merck monotherapy results were published, said Keytruda could become “a new standard of care”.  The various findings suggest that treating lung cancer - the biggest cancer killer globally - with powerful new immune system-boosting medicines is going to involve more permutations than some experts originally expected.  Rival drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb had tried a catch-all approach with its Opdivo drug but it failed to help previously untreated patients when given on its own in a trial that included people with low levels of a protein called PD-L1.  Keytruda, as a sole agent, was targeted only at patients with high PD-L1, making them more receptive to immunotherapy.  Lead researcher Martin Reck of Germany’s Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf predicted that testing for the PD-L1 biomarker would now become standard “from today”.  U.S. regulators are expected to decide whether to approve Keytruda for first-line non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type, by Dec. 24.  Merck had already said in June that Keytruda worked in the trial but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed at ESMO.  COMBINATION THERAPY  The second trial, mixing Keytruda with chemotherapy, was much smaller but was notable because it was the first time that a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been shown to work in a randomized Phase II study.  Many experts have been skeptical about this approach and investors’ expectations, up until now, have been quite low.  In the event, researchers reported that Merck’s combination cut the risk of disease progression or death by 47 percent compared to chemotherapy alone after 10.6 months, while 55 percent of patients saw their tumors shrink versus 29 percent.  Patients in this trial were not selected by PD-L1 expression but the study did find that those with higher PD-L1 had a higher response.  Roger Perlmutter, Merck’s head of research, said both trials suggested Keytruda could offer a broad array of patients meaningful improvement over standard platinum-based chemotherapy, which is now more than two decades old.  Drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo work by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body’s natural killer cells to home in on tumors.  They are expected to sell tens of billions of dollars in the years ahead, with lung cancer the largest market.  Up until now, Bristol has dominated the field but investors have started to shift their bets, with forecasts for Opdivo declining while those for Keytruda have risen.  The current consensus forecast among analysts is for Keytruda sales to reach $8 billion in 2021, with Opdivo selling $10.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Results of Bristol’s failed Opdivo trial, which included patients with tumors testing only 5 percent or higher for PD-L1 against the 50 percent cut-off used by Merck, were also presented at ESMO.  These showed progression-free survival was 4.2 months with Opdivo and 5.9 months with chemotherapy, although the difference was not statistically significant. Overall survival was 14.4 months with Opdivo versus 13.2 months.  The failure of Opdivo to work for “all comers” in lung cancer was first announced in August, without any details. It was a major setback for Bristol, wiping out around a quarter of the company’s market value, and it has caused investors to rethink prospects for immunotherapy treatments.  Many now believe that combination therapy is the way ahead, with Bristol and AstraZeneca working primarily on using two immunotherapies together, while Roche and Merck look at adding chemotherapy.	0
Antidepressants relieve hot flashes  By Rob Stein  An antidepressant can help alleviate hot flashes that plague many menopausal women, according to new federally funded research.  A study involving 205 women found those taking the antidepressant Lexapro experienced a 47 percent reduction in number of hot flashes they were experiencing and the hot flashes they did have tended to be less severe, researchers reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association.  For years, many women took hormones to alleviate hots flashes. But hormone use plummeted after the federal government's massive Women's Health Initiative shocked women and doctors by concluding the risks of the medication outweighed its benefits.  Since then, many women have been suffering through hot flashes and searching for effective alternatives. Some small pilot studies have indicated that the newer class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin and serotonin norepinephrine reupdate inhibitors (SSRIs and SNRIs) might be effective.  In the new study, Ellen Freeman of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia and colleagues gave 205 women who were either starting to go through menopause who had already gone through menopause either Lexapro or a placebo for eight weeks. When the study started, the women were having an average of nearly 10 hot flashes each day.  The number of hot flashes among the women taking Lexapro, which is also known as escitalopram, dropped to about five on average after eight weeks--a 47 percent decrease or about 4.6 fewer hot flashes per day, the researchers reported. The severity of the hot flashes also decreased. Among those taking a placebo, the number of hot flashes dropped to 6.43 per day, a 33 percent decrease of 3.2 fewer hot flashes per day. Lexapro seemed to work even among women who were not anxious or depressed.  The hot flashes increased after the women stopped taking the drug but not among those taking a placebo.  Although the benefit was modest, it appeared to be significant enough that women might consider trying it, the researchers said. The study is the first to examine whether there are any racial differences in how well an antidepressant works in alleviating hot flashes. African-American women are more likely than white women to report hot flashes. The study found none.	1
"By Amanda Gardner  HealthDay Reporter  FRIDAY, Jan. 1, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Three-quarters of patients undergoing surgery for stubborn sinusitis saw significant improvements in their quality of life, new research shows.  Most of the remaining 25 percent also saw some improvement, just not as dramatic, said Dr. Timothy Smith, lead author of a study appearing in the January issue of Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck Surgery.  ""Certainly this reinforces our belief that sinus surgery increases the quality of life of patients, and I see that clinically as well as scientifically,"" added Dr. Jordan S. Josephson, a sinus and allergy specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""Previous studies have been single-center studies, and this is a bigger study using multiple centers and using a fairly large population, so it further says sinus surgery is a really good thing to do if you need it.""  Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) affects a sizable minority -- 14 percent to 16 percent -- of U.S. residents. The condition, marked by symptoms such as sinus pain and pressure, headache, stuffy nose and sneezing, can compromise quality of life more than even congestive heart failure, back pain or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the study authors said.  Endoscopic sinus surgery has been performed in the United States since the mid-1980s, said Smith, who is director of the Oregon Sinus Center at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland.  ""It's a minimally invasive type of surgery performed with a telescope that goes into the nostril,"" then basically snips away abnormal and interfering tissue while leaving normal tissue behind, Smith explained.  Smith and his co-authors studied 302 patients with CRS from three academic medical centers, following them for an average of a year and a half after their surgery.  ""These were patients who have chronic sinusitis so, by definition, they have at least three months of symptoms and they have evidence of an ongoing inflammation or infection of their nose and sinuses on either a CT scan or an examination of the nose and sinuses,"" Smith said.  Following the surgery, about 76 percent of patients had ""clinically significant"" improvement in quality of life, as measured by various validated scales.  Patients with worse disease at the outset seemed to fare the best after the procedure, as did those undergoing surgery for the first time. This second finding is probably explained by the fact that people going for second or further surgeries were probably sicker to begin with, Josephson said.  None of which is to say that patients shouldn't try medical therapies first, he added.  ""I don't think it means everyone with CRS should consider surgery. They should try medical therapy, and if medical therapy fails and the surgeon feels that part of the problem is anatomic, then surgery would be a good tool for them to use,"" Josephson said. ""Some people with stage 1 and 2 diseases may even get cured. This is a wonderful renewed hope of feeling better.""  More information  The U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has more on sinusitis."	0
If taking more vitamin and mineral supplements is part of your plan for a healthier new year, a new study may prompt you to reconsider.  Researchers who scoured the medical literature for evidence that calcium and vitamin D pills could help prevent bone fractures came up empty.  Their analysis focused on adults older than age 50 who lived on their own (that is, not in a nursing home or other type of residential care facility). Fractures are a serious health concern for this population — previous studies have found that about 40% of women in this age group will wind up with at least one “major osteoporotic fracture” at some point in their lives, and that among adults who break a hip, 20% died within a year of their injury.  The researchers, led by Dr. Jia-Guo Zhao of Tianjin Hospital in northeastern China, combed through clinical trials, systematic reviews and other reports published in the last decade, since late 2006. They identified 51,145 people who were included in studies assessing the role of calcium and/or vitamin D in preventing bone fractures.  Their findings appear in Tuesday’s edition of the Journal of the American Medical Assn.  Among the 14 trials that pitted calcium supplements against either a placebo or no treatment, there was no statistically significant relationship between use of the mineral (in pill form) and the risk of suffering a hip fracture. Nor was there any clear link between calcium supplements and fractures involving the spine or other bones.  Even when the researchers accounted for each study participant’s gender, past history of bone fractures, the amount of calcium they consumed in their diets and the dose of the calcium pills they took (if they did), there was still no sign that supplements were helpful.  An additional 17 trials examined the role of vitamin D, which helps the body absorb calcium. Once again, they found no statistically significant link between supplement use and hip fracture risk. Ditto for fractures in the spine and elsewhere.  Upon drilling down to certain subgroups, they found that for people who started out with at least 20 nanograms of vitamin D per milliliter of blood, adding more vitamin D through supplements was associated with a greater risk of hip fractures. The same was true for people who took high doses of vitamin D supplements just once a year.  Finally, there were 13 trials involving people who took a combined calcium-vitamin D supplement. As before, there was no statistically significant link between supplement use and the risk for any kind of fracture or combination of fractures. That held up even when accounting for gender, past fractures, supplement dose, dietary calcium or baseline blood levels of vitamin D.  The researchers noted that thousands of people in this final group were participants in the Women’s Health Initiative, a long-term study sponsored by the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute in the U.S. Earlier reports based on data gathered by the Women’s Health Initiative found that calcium and vitamin D supplements were associated with a lower risk of fractures, but only for women who took hormone therapy after menopause. To get a clearer picture of the direct link (if any) between supplements and fracture risk, Zhao and his colleagues opted not to include data from women on hormone therapy.  It’s still possible that calcium and vitamin D supplements are useful for people who live in nursing homes or other residential facilities, the study authors wrote. Such people are more likely to have osteoporosis, due to a combination of poor diet, less sun exposure (which the body needs to synthesize vitamin D) and other factors.  But for older adults who live on their own, they wrote, the results are clear: “These findings do not support the routine use of these supplements.”  CAPTION Revelers joined community members and indigenous leaders from around the world at the Symbiosis Gathering in Big Summit Prairie, Ore., to mark the Great American Eclipse.

Alzheimer’s disease now affects an estimated 5.5 million Americans, and after decades of feverish work, researchers have so far failed to find a treatment that halts or reverses the inexorable loss of memory, function and thinking ability that characterize this feared illness.  But researchers have been quite successful at devising ways to diagnose Alzheimer’s earlier and earlier. And that capability has emerged alongside evidence of a tantalizing possibility: that if you can catch the disease early enough — ideally when symptoms of confusion or memory loss are just emerging, or before — some therapies already in hand might essentially halt its progress.  For anyone who detects some mental slippage and wonders, “Is it Alzheimer’s?” the current state of dementia research raises a very real, and very wrenching, dilemma: If I can know, do I want to know?  That is, if it’s Alzheimer’s disease, would I do anything differently? Would there be some benefit in knowing for my loved ones, for myself?  Advertisement  Doctors and insurers, including the federal government, which administers Medicare, are asking some variants of the same questions: If an effective test, which costs between $3,000 and $5,000 a shot, can diagnose dementia early, and distinguish Alzheimer’s from other forms of dementia, should it be recommended to patients with cognitive concerns and routinely covered by their insurance? Would it make patients’ lives better, or lower the cost of their care?  Newly unveiled research results are bringing some clarity to such deliberations. And other new research, published Wednesday in the journal Neurology, proposes a new diagnostic tool that may be able to detect Alzheimer’s, and distinguish it from another form of dementia, more simply and cheaply than does the best test now available.  At the Alzheimer’s Assn. International Conference in London last week, researchers reported their preliminary findings from a trial that is testing the impact of diagnostic testing for Alzheimer’s disease on nearly 19,000 Medicare beneficiaries.  All of these study participants — largely people in their 70s, all with a diagnosis of either “mild cognitive impairment” or atypical dementia — are living with the unconfirmed suspicion that they have Alzheimer’s. The study is underwritten by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Alzheimer’s Assn. It set out to find out whether knowing — getting the costly test that would offer either confirmation or reprieve — would change the way that patients with cognitive troubles are treated, or the way that they plan their lives.  Advertisement  The preliminary results suggested it did. After getting the results of a PET brain scan to detect and measure amyloid deposits, which are the key hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease, roughly two-thirds of the subjects saw their medication regimens changed or were counseled differently by their doctors about what to expect.  That new information may have guided family caregivers in planning their own futures, or prodded patients to make financial decisions and power-of-attorney assignments sooner. Some who learned that they did not have Alzheimer’s discontinued medications that can have unpleasant side effects. Others learned they do have Alzheimer’s and decided to enroll in clinical trials that will test new drugs.  A second study presented in London analyzed data from several studies, and found that in a large population of research participants with cognitive concerns, brain amyloid PET scans led to a change in diagnosis in approximately 20% of cases.  “People should know what’s coming,” said Dr. Maria Carrillo, chief science officer for the Alzheimer’s Assn. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has given amyloid scans a provisional approval, meaning they do not routinely pay for them. The results may guide the agency to rethink its position, she added.  The PET scan bore bad news for Ken Lehmann, who enrolled last year in the IDEAS trial, short for Imaging Dementia — Evidence for Amyloid Scanning. After his long, slow decline that has flummoxed doctors, Lehmann’s brain scan clearly showed he has Alzheimer’s disease.  The certainty that has brought has been a long time coming. When Lehmann began withdrawing from friends, forgetting to pay bills and having trouble following conversations, he was just 58. Now, he’s 80.  Ken had always been considered a “Renaissance man” — a furniture company executive who rebuilt Porsches, played basketball and loved to entertain friends, said his wife, Mary Margaret Lehmann. But as years passed, his judgment seemed off. He would lose track of points he was making, and sometimes of where he was at.  It would take the loss of their home and a business bankruptcy for the Lehmanns to demand answers to what was going on. In 2009, they moved from Sacramento to Edina, Minn., to live with a daughter. And there, at last, they found a neurologist who, despite initial skepticism (“but he presents so well!”	0

"Weighing effectiveness versus risk in obesity drugs Experts disagree on whether the FDA is too tough or not tough enough on weight-loss medications.  In their quest to find drugs to curb obesity, scientists have had about as much success as long-term dieters who want to stay thin — which is to say, very little. In fact, the last year has been so bleak on the research front that some experts are questioning whether a long-desired safe and effective diet pill can be found.  Advisory panels for the Food and Drug Administration recommended against approval of two experimental weight-loss drugs this year — Lorqess in September and Qnexa in July — citing unacceptable risks for unimpressive benefits. Another drug, Meridia, was withdrawn from the market in October after it was linked to higher risks of heart attacks and strokes.  Last week, an advisory panel did finally recommend approval of a weight-loss drug: Contrave, a combination of two existing drugs, the antidepressant bupropion and the anti-addiction medication naltrexone. (FDA rulings for all three drugs are expected next year.) But it did so with a marked lack of enthusiasm, citing the medication's poor effectiveness and a need to closely track health risks, such as high blood pressure, once the drug is in broad use.  As drug after drug falters or falls by the wayside, doctors who treat obese patients are growing increasingly frustrated. They say that the agency's standards for approving anti-obesity drugs are overly stringent and fail to recognize the health risks associated with carrying extra weight — at a time when almost 34% of U.S. adults are obese and almost 6% are morbidly obese, and when study after study has shown that the most that can be hoped for from diets and exercise, on average, is a 10% loss of body weight sustained for at least one year.  So gloomy is the climate for these drugs that some experts fear drug companies will out-and-out abandon the anti-obesity market.  ""Every big company is going to get out of the game, and venture capitalists are not going to invest in the smaller companies to develop drugs,"" Dr. Donna Ryan, past president of the Obesity Society, said in October during that group's annual meeting in San Diego. ""Everybody in the obesity field is upset. There is a lot of anger."""	1
"A Diet High In Fiber May Help Protect Against Breast Cancer  Enlarge this image toggle caption Morgan McCloy/NPR Morgan McCloy/NPR  If the advice to eat more fiber seems easy to ignore, you're not alone. Most Americans don't get the 25 to 38 grams a day that's recommended, depending on age and gender.  But if you're skimping on fiber, the health stakes are high, especially if you're a teenage girl.  A study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics concludes that eating lots of fiber-rich foods during high school years may significantly reduce a woman's risk of developing breast cancer.  The findings are based on a long-term study of 44,000 women who were surveyed about their eating habits in high school. The women also completed detailed questionnaires about their dietary habits every four years.  The researchers found that women who consumed high levels of fiber (28 grams per day, on average) had a 24 percent lower risk of developing breast cancer before menopause, compared with women who ate low levels of fiber (14 grams per day, on average). For the women on the high-fiber diet, the lifetime risk of developing breast cancer was also cut by 16 percent.  Of course, the idea that high-fiber diets can help keep us healthy is not new. It's well-known that fiber can prevent constipation and keep the bowel moving by making stools bulkier and absorbing water. Prior studies have shown dietary fiber can protect against colorectal cancer and may lower the risks of diabetes and heart disease. There's also a growing body of evidence linking fiber to weight management.  This new study provides some evidence of yet another potential benefit.  ""This is a really important study ... [suggesting] that the more fiber you eat during your high school years, the lower your risk is in developing breast cancer,"" says Kimberly Blackwell, a breast cancer specialist at the Duke Cancer Center.  In a commentary accompanying the study in Pediatrics, Blackwell writes, ""There is longstanding evidence that dietary fibers may reduce circulating estrogen levels."" And this may help explain the reduced risk of breast cancer.  The authors point to other possible explanations, too. For instance, high-fiber diets may reduce the risk of breast cancer by improving insulin sensitivity, since fiber can slow down the absorption of sugars and help keep blood sugar levels more stable.  Maryam Farvid, a fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health who is lead author of the study, says the influence of fiber on cancer risk may be time-sensitive. Adolescence is ""a period when breast cancer risk factors appear to be particularly important,"" she says.  One limitation of this new study is that it relies on data from women who had to recall what they ate during high school. They were in their 30s and 40 when asked, so there could be ""recall bias"" — the women's memories may be foggy.  ""The recollection of dietary habits more than a decade earlier must be questioned,"" writes Blackwell. On the other hand, she says, ""people's dietary habits don't really change a lot. ... In general, what you eat as a teenager is really formative as to what you eat later in life.""  So, how might the message of this new study linking high-fiber diets to a lower risk of breast cancer be communicated to teenagers?  This is a question Kristi King, a dietitian at Texas Children's Hospital, has thought about a lot.  She says it can be hard to get the attention of teenagers about healthy eating. ""Unfortunately for teenagers, they're [into] instant gratification,"" and they're not necessarily focused on how their actions today will influence their future health, she says.  But, she says, explaining that dietary choices may influence their risk of breast cancer may grab their attention. ""Most teenage girls do know someone that has been affected by breast cancer,"" says King. ""So I feel like that touches a nerve with them.""  Given the known benefits of high-fiber diets and the growing evidence that fiber may play a role in preventing disease, the government's Dietary Guidelines for Americans also say most people need to consume more.  Women are advised to consume 25 grams a day. Men are advised to consume 38 grams a day.  So, how best to reach these targets? ""Add fiber at each meal,"" says King, in the form of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts or seeds. Pears are a great bet with 7 grams of fiber apiece.  And check out fiber-rich snacks, like popcorn and edamame."	0
"A Simple Emergency Room Intervention Can Help Cut Suicide Risk  Enlarge this image toggle caption FangXiaNuo/Getty Images FangXiaNuo/Getty Images  Many people who attempt suicide end up in an emergency room for immediate treatment. But few of those suicide survivors get the follow-up care they need at a time when they are especially likely to attempt suicide again.  Now, a study shows that a simple intervention conducted by staff in emergency departments can reduce the risk of future attempts. The intervention involves creating a safety plan for each patient and following up with phone calls after discharge.  ""It reduced the odds of suicidal behavior by half,"" says Barbara Stanley, a psychologist at Columbia University and the lead author of the study. ""That's a phenomenal difference.""  The study, which was published Wednesday in JAMA Psychiatry, included 1,200 patients at five Veterans Affairs hospitals around the country. The findings offer a way for hospitals and clinics to help reduce the rising numbers of death by suicide across the country.  You Are Not Alone If you or someone you know may be considering suicide, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (en Español: 1-888-628-9454; deaf and hard of hearing: 1-800-799-4889) or the Crisis Text Line by texting 741741.  ""When someone goes to the emergency room for a suicide attempt, they are at risk of another suicide attempt for the next three months,"" says Stanley. ""It's like a ticking time bomb.""  This is the first large-scale study of the Safety Planning Intervention, which Stanley and her group developed in 2008 and which has been adopted at hospitals and clinics around the country. It can be provided by a physician, a nurse or a social worker and requires very little training.  ""The interesting thing about the Safety Planning Intervention is that it is a relatively brief intervention and can be used in a lot of different [health care] settings,"" says Brian Ahmedani, director of behavioral health research at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, who wasn't involved in the new study.  Many health care systems are starting to think about ways to prevent suicide, he says. That's because, as his own work has shown, almost 83 percent of people who die by suicide make a health care visit in the year before their death. Yet only 50 percent of those people have been diagnosed with a mental illness.  The intervention studied by Stanley and her group starts in the ER or a clinic, before the suicidal patient is released. First, a health care professional talks with the patient and tries to understand that person's warning signs for a suicide attempt.  ""If they've grappled with being suicidal, they know what their warning signs are,"" says Stanley. For example, she says, someone might say, "" 'I find that I'm staying in my room, not answering the phone, not answering texts, not answering emails.' That could be a warning sign."" Others might have repeated thoughts that they're not worthy.  The next step is for the patient — with help from the clinician — to come up with a set of coping strategies to help get through moments of intense suicidal ideation.  For most people, this intense state only lasts from a few minutes to a couple of hours, she says.  The coping strategy could be something as simple as playing video games, watching TV or talking to a loved one.  If people contemplating suicide can distract themselves with something they enjoy doing, they can bypass that narrow window during which suicidal thoughts can overpower them, notes Stanley. ""For suicidal people, the passage of time is their friend,"" she says.  The provider also tries to persuade patients to remove or distance themselves from their means of suicide. For example, if they own a gun, they should lock it away or give it to someone who can keep it away from them. ""If you make it really hard to use whatever means you were going to use, time passes and you give a chance for suicidal thoughts to subside,"" she says.  Safety planning includes follow-up phone calls with the patient — the first call is made within 72 hours of being discharged from the ER. The provider asks the patient how the safety plan is being used and helps revise it if needed. The provider also makes sure the patient sees a mental health care provider for long-term care. A provider keeps calling until the patient has had a second appointment with a therapist or counselor.  That follow-up is key, says Julie Goldstein Grumet, a psychologist at the Zero Suicide Institute at the Education Development Center, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit.  ""People often fall off and they don't follow up on their referrals,"" she says. ""And the times during these transitions from acute care settings is one of the highest risk times of suicides.""  To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, Stanley's team looked at five VA emergency departments across the country that used it and compared the outcomes with four VA e"	0
NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Fast food outlets should hand out free cholesterol-lowering statin drugs to their customers to “neutralize” the heart risks of eating fatty foods like burgers and fries, British scientists suggested on Thursday.  The quadruple bypass cheese burger is displayed at Heart Attack Grill in Chandler, Arizona June 17, 2009. REUTERS/Joshua Lott  But a few experts say you might want to ask your server to hold the statin at this point.  In a study published in the American Journal of Cardiology, scientists from the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College London calculated that the reduction in heart disease risk offered by a statin could offset the increase in risk from eating a cheeseburger and a milkshake.  “Statins don’t cut out all of the unhealthy effects of a burger and fries. It’s better to avoid fatty food altogether. But we’ve worked out that in terms of your likelihood of having a heart attack, taking a statin can reduce your risk to more or less the same degree as a fast food meal increases it,” said Dr. Darrel Francis, who led the research team.  “When people engage in risky behaviors like driving or smoking, they’re encouraged to take measures that minimize their risk, like wearing a seatbelt or choosing cigarettes with filters. Taking a statin is a rational way of lowering some of the risks of eating a fatty meal.”  Still, Peter Weissberg, medical director at the British Heart Foundation (BHF) health charity, said Francis’ idea should not be taken too literally. He urged people to focus on maintaining a good diet and taking exercise to keep their hearts healthy.  “Statins are a vital medicine for people with — or at high risk of developing — heart disease,” he said. “They are not a magic bullet.”  A study in June in the Archives of Internal Medicine suggested, in fact, that statins do not save lives in patients without heart disease, although they may prevent some non-fatal heart attacks.  Dr. Franz Messerli, the director of the hypertension program at two New York hospitals, St. Luke’s and Roosevelt, worried about the message handing out statins would send to burger-eaters.  “Complimentary statin packets are prone to ... give Quarter Pounder consumers a sense of false security,” he told Reuters Health by email.  While statins might combat some of the toll that fatty foods take on cholesterol, there’s a lot they can’t negate: “sodium content is high, fibres are absent, and caloric load gargantuan,” Messerli said of the fast food the authors looked at.  Statins are among the most widely used drugs for the treatment and prevention of heart disease and strokes — the world’s top killers.  One statin, a generic drug called simvastatin, is already available in low doses over the counter at pharmacies in Britain without a prescription. Other statins such as Pfizer’s Lipitor and AstraZeneca’s Crestor - which are among the biggest-selling drugs in the world — are for prescription only.  In the U.S., all statins are only available by prescription.  “Although no substitute for systematic lifestyle improvements, including healthy diet, regular exercise, weight loss, and smoking cessation, complimentary statin packets would add, at little cost, one positive choice to a panoply of negative ones,” the scientists write in their paper.  Francis’ team — who worked independently and had no funding from the drug or food industries for their research — used data from a previous large study to quantify how a person’s heart attack risk increases with their daily intake of total fat and harmful trans fats.  They compared this with the decrease in risk from taking statins, using data from seven previously published trials.  “It makes sense to make risk-reducing supplements available just as easily as the unhealthy condiments (such as salt or ketchup) that are provided free of charge,” Francis said in his report of the research. “It would cost less than 5 pence ($0.07) per customer — not much different to a sachet of ketchup.”  SOURCE: link.reuters.com/gak74n American Journal of Cardiology, online August 12, 2010.	0

Pestikas struggled with depression and anxiety and made several suicide attempts before starting ketamine treatments earlier in the year. (AP Photo/Teresa Crawford)  CHICAGO (AP) — It was launched decades ago as an anesthetic for animals and people, became a potent battlefield pain reliever in Vietnam and morphed into the trippy club drug Special K.  Now the chameleon drug ketamine is finding new life as an unapproved treatment for depression and suicidal behavior. Clinics have opened around the United States promising instant relief with their “unique” doses of ketamine in IVs, sprays or pills. And desperate patients are shelling out thousands of dollars for treatment often not covered by health insurance, with scant evidence on long-term benefits and risks.  Chicago preschool teacher Lauren Pestikas long struggled with depression and anxiety and made several suicide attempts before trying ketamine earlier this year.  The price tag so far is about $3,000, but “it’s worth every dime and penny,” said the 36-year-old.  Pestikas said she feels much better for a few weeks after each treatment, but the effects wear off and she scrambles to find a way to pay for another one.  For now, ketamine has not received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating depression, though doctors can use it for that purpose.  Ketamine has been around since the 1960s and is widely used as an anesthesia drug during surgery because it doesn’t suppress breathing. Compared to opioids such as morphine, ketamine isn’t as addictive and doesn’t cause breathing problems. And some studies have shown that ketamine can ease symptoms within hours for the toughest cases.  Its potential effects on depression were discovered in animal experiments in the late 1980s and early 1990s showing that glutamate, a brain chemical messenger, might play a role in depression, and that drugs including ketamine that target the glutamate pathway might work as antidepressants.  Conventional antidepressants like Prozac target serotonin, a different chemical messenger, and typically take weeks to months to kick in — a lag that can cause severely depressed patients to sink deeper into despair.  Ketamine’s potential for almost immediate if temporary relief is what makes it so exciting, said Dr. Jennifer Vande Voort, a Mayo Clinic psychiatrist who has used ketamine to treat depression patients since February.  “We don’t have a lot of things that provide that kind of effect. What I worry about is that it gets so hyped up,” she said.  The strongest studies suggest it’s most useful and generally safe in providing short-term help for patients who have not benefited from antidepressants. That amounts to about one-third of the roughly 300 million people with depression worldwide.  “It truly has revolutionized the field,” changing scientists’ views on how depression affects the brain and showing that rapid relief is possible, said Yale University psychiatrist Dr. Gerard Sanacora, who has done research for or consulted with companies seeking to develop ketamine-based drugs.  But to become standard depression treatment, he said, much more needs to be known.  Last year, Sanacora co-authored an American Psychiatric Association task force review of ketamine treatment for mood disorders that noted the benefits but said “major gaps” remain in knowledge about long-term effectiveness and safety. Most studies have been small, done in research settings and not in the real world.  When delivered through an IV, ketamine can cause a rapid increase in heart rate and blood pressure that could be dangerous for some patients. Ketamine also can cause hallucinations that some patients find scary.  “There are some very real concerns,” Sanacora said. “We do know this drug can be abused, so we have to be very careful about how this is developed.”  Dr. Rahul Khare, an emergency medicine specialist in Chicago, first learned about ketamine’s other potential benefits a decade ago from a depressed and anxious patient he was preparing to sedate to fix a repeat dislocated shoulder.  “He said, ‘Doc, give me what I got last time. For about three weeks after I got it I felt so much better,’” Khare recalled.  Khare became intrigued and earlier this year began offering ketamine for severe depression at an outpatient clinic he opened a few years ago. He also joined the American Society for Ketamine Physicians, formed a year ago representing about 140 U.S. doctors, nurses, psychologists and others using ketamine for depression or oth	0
"For the first time, a large study suggests that a vitamin might modestly lower the risk of the most common types of skin cancer in people with a history of these relatively harmless yet troublesome growths.  In a study in Australia, people who took a specific type of vitamin B3 for a year had a 23 percent lower rate of new skin cancers compared to others who took dummy pills. In absolute terms, it meant that vitamin takers developed fewer than two of these cancers on average versus roughly 2.5 cancers for the others.  The study did not involve melanoma, the most deadly form of skin cancer. Instead, it aimed at more common forms — basal and squamous cell cancers. More than 3 million cases are diagnosed each year in the United States.  ""These are sort of the run-of-the-mill skin cancers that so many people get,"" said Dr. Richard Schilsky, chief medical officer of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, an organization of cancer specialists. ""They're rarely lethal but they're very persistent and they keep coming back,"" and are expensive to remove, usually through surgery, freezing off the spots or radiation.  He and other doctors with the oncology group said the vitamin, called nicotinamide, could offer a cheap, easy way to lower risk.  However, Australia has higher rates of skin cancer than the U.S. and other parts of the world, and some doctors may want more evidence beyond this single study before recommending the pills. Vitamins have long proved elusive for cancer prevention, and some studies have even found certain ones can be harmful.  Researchers also stressed they were not suggesting vitamin use for people who have not yet had one of these cancers.  ""At the moment, it's not something for the general population,"" said the study's leader, Dr. Diona Damian of the Dermatology University of Sydney in Australia.  ""We must always remember the basics of sun-sensible behaviors"" — avoiding overexposure and using sunscreen — as the best ways for anyone to lower risk, she said.  The study involved 386 people who had at least two skin cancers in the previous five years. They took either 500 milligrams of the vitamin or dummy pills twice a day for a year. Neither they nor their doctors knew who got what until the study ended.  Besides reducing the rate of skin cancers, vitamin use also seemed to cut the rate of precancers — scaly patches of skin called actinic keratoses — by 11 percent after three months of use and 20 percent after nine months.  Participants were tracked for six months after they stopped taking their pills, and the rate of new skin cancers was similar in both groups.  ""The benefit wears off fairly quickly,"" Damian said. ""You need to continue taking the tablets for them to continue to be effective.""  Nicotinamide (nih-kuh-TEE'-nuh-myd) is thought to help repair DNA in cells damaged by sun exposure. It is not the same as nicotine, the addictive stuff in tobacco. It's also not the same as niacin and some other forms of B3, which can cause flushing, headaches and blood pressure problems. Those problems were not seen with nicotinamide in the study.  Nicotinamide is sold over the counter, is easy to take, and ""there are essentially no side effects,"" Schilsky said."	0
"April 21, 2010 -- An experimental oral drug is showing early promise for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, a study shows.  In preliminary research published this week in Nature, researchers from Bristol-Myers Squibb -- the maker of the drug -- report that patients who took the drug showed dramatic reductions in viral load while exhibiting few side effects.  The research is so early that the drug hasn't been named. It is known as BMS-790052.  But the study provides the first clinical evidence that targeting the HCV protein NS5A may be an effective strategy for curing patients who are chronically infected with the HCV virus, says Nicholas A. Meanwell, PhD, who is executive director of chemistry with Bristol-Myers Squibb.  Chronic HCV infection is a leading cause of liver cirrhosis, liver cancer, and liver failure and is the leading reason for liver transplants in the U.S.  The current treatment for chronic HCV -- intravenously administered peg-interferon and ribavirin -- cures about half of people with genotype 1 who take it. But many patients find they cannot tolerate months of treatment with interferon, which can cause anemia and severe flu-like symptoms.  Cure rates are lower for people with HCV genotype 1, which includes about 70% of Americans chronically infected with hepatitis C virus; and they are lower still for people who do not respond well to initial treatment.  ""It is clear that other treatments are needed,"" Meanwell tells WebMD. ""What we are developing, and a lot of other companies too, are small molecule antiviral agents that specifically target the virus.""  In fact, no fewer than 90 studies are currently underway examining different HCV-targeting drugs. Two of these drugs, Vertex Pharmaceutical's telaprevir and Merck's boceprevir, are in the final stages of study and may make it to the market as early as next year.  A unique thing about the NS5A-targeting drug, according to Meanwell, is that laboratory studies show it to be effective against all HCV genotypes."	0
"By Randy Dotinga  HealthDay Reporter  MONDAY, March 19, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- New research finds that a minimally invasive surgical procedure to treat hernias results in less chronic pain and a faster recovery when compared to a traditional approach.  One expert, however, said the older strategy may still be the best option in some cases.  ""It's not one-size-fits-all,"" said Dr. L. Michael Brunt, a professor at Washington University in St. Louis. ""One repair isn't appropriate for all circumstances.""  Hernias occur when part of an internal organ, such as the intestines, bulges out through muscle. At issue are the surgical approaches that physicians use when a patient suffers from a hernia in the groin.  The procedures are designed to reduce the bulge of the hernia and make a patch so it doesn't protrude again. ""It's as if you had a leak in a tire that's ballooned out,"" Brunt said. ""You'll patch it to prevent it from continuing to protrude.""  The study, led by researchers at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, examined two procedures.  One procedure, known as total extraperitoneal inguinal hernioplasty, is performed under a general anesthetic and uses a laparoscopic approach through a small opening. It was developed in the 1990s, Brunt said.  The other approach is older and is performed through a 2- to 2.5-inch incision in the groin, Brunt said. It can be done under local anesthesia. The study authors didn't examine a third approach, known as ""patch and plug,"" he said.  In the study, researchers randomly assigned 660 hernia patients to one of the two surgical procedures. Almost all the patients were men, and their average age was around 55.  The researchers followed up with 75 percent of the patients after an average period of five years.  Hernias recurred in 5 percent of laparoscopic and 8 percent of the traditional-procedure patients. Recurrences decreased to 0.5 percent and 4 percent, respectively, if the procedures were performed by experienced surgeons.  After five years, 28 percent of those who had the traditional procedure reported chronic pain, compared to 15 percent of the laparoscopic group.  The study ""confirms what a lot of surgeons who do both procedures know already,"" Brunt said. ""There's less pain and a bit of a faster recovery from the laparoscopic procedure.""  Still, ""the vast majority of patients do well, regardless of the approach,"" he said.  Why use the traditional approach if the laparoscopic technique is better in some ways? The traditional approach may be appropriate when it's too risky to place patients under general anesthesia, Brunt said, such as in elderly patients and those with multiple health problems.  Brunt said the costs of the two procedures are comparable, although the laparoscopic procedure may cost more.  The findings appear in the March issue of the Archives of Surgery.

Photo  For years pregnant women have been warned about eating tuna because of concerns about mercury exposure. But a federal panel has reignited the debate about the benefits and risks of eating tuna and other seafood during pregnancy.  Experts agree that seafood is a rich source of important nutrients, and that most of us don’t eat enough of it. Fish is rich in omega-3 fatty acids, B vitamins, iodine, selenium and vitamin D. And numerous studies show that the nutrients in fish are particularly important for brain development in fetuses and nursing infants.  As part of a sweeping review of nutrition recommendations, the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee recently reiterated the current seafood guidelines: Americans should eat a wide variety of seafood. The report also acknowledges the risk of mercury exposure from certain kinds of seafoods, and notes that women who are pregnant, nursing or may become pregnant should avoid certain kinds — tilefish, shark, swordfish and king mackerel — because of their high mercury content.  The panel withheld a recommendation about tuna, second only to shrimp in popularity in the United States. Current guidelines from the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency warn pregnant and nursing women to limit tuna consumption to six ounces per week.  The advisory committee has recommended that these agencies “re-evaluate” their stance on tuna for pregnant women. In the report, the panel argues that albacore tuna is a “special case.” They noted that even when women ate double the recommended weekly amount of tuna, the benefits far outweighed the risks. “All evidence was in favor of net benefits for infant development and (cardiovascular disease) risk reduction,” the panel wrote.  The suggestion that pregnant women can eat more white albacore tuna — the type of tuna typically used in canned tuna — has upset advocacy groups that have called for increased warnings about mercury on tuna packaging.  “Tuna is responsible for nearly seven times more mercury exposure than the four high-mercury fish that the Federal Food and Drug Administration advises pregnant women not to eat,” said Michael Bender, director of the mercury policy project, in a statement. “So why would the proposed 2015 dietary guidelines recommend that pregnant women eat more of it?”  But Dr. Steve Abrams, a panel member involved in the seafood recommendations and medical director of the Neonatal Nutrition Program at Baylor College of Medicine, said that while women need to be aware of the types of fish they are eating, the evidence is strong that fish consumption by mothers is good for the brains of their babies.  “The goal of the dietary guidelines is to give people a healthy way to eat and not to include or exclude certain foods,” said Dr. Abrams. “The benefit of having (omega-3 fatty acids) in your diet really exceeds the likely risk of contamination. The point is that you should have a variety of types of seafood and not limit yourself to one type, and variety includes canned tuna.”  Alice Lichtenstein, senior scientist and director of the Cardiovascular Nutrition Laboratory at Tufts University said the panel hasn’t suggested that pregnant women eat more tuna. “The issue of fish contamination is a moving target and you need very current data,” said Dr. Lichtenstein. “It may be that the issue is re-evaluated and there is no change.”  Mercury levels in our oceans are on the rise due to an increase in industrial mercury emissions. Plants, plankton and tiny fish that have absorbed small amounts of mercury are eaten by larger fish. Over time, large fish sharks and swordfish accumulate high levels of mercury. As a result, health officials recommend fish like sardines, salmon, tilapia and trout that are lower on the food chain and have accumulated less mercury in their tissue.  The benefits of fish consumption on a developing fetus are clear. In a Harvard study of 135 mothers and infants, researchers tracked fish consumption during pregnancy and tested the mother’s hair to measure her mercury exposure. They found that for each weekly serving of fish the mother ate while pregnant, her baby’s score on visual recognition memory tests increased an average of four points. At the same time, a baby’s score dropped by 7.5 points for every one part per million increase in mercury found in the mother’s hair sample. The babies who scored highest on the memory tests were those whose mothers had consumed two or more servings of fish each week during their pregnancy, but were tested to have very low mercury levels.  Health officials have long worried about balancing warnings about mercury against the obvious benefits of consuming more fish. Currently fewer than one in five Americans eats the recommended two servings a week of fish. About one-third eat one serving of seafood weekly and nearly half of us eats very little seafood or none at all.  This fall Consumer Reports issued a lengthy paper on fish and merc	0
(Reuters Health) - People who get minimally-invasive surgery to replace damaged heart valves have an easier time completing daily tasks and a better quality of life after the procedure, a research review suggests.  The analysis focused on people with what’s known as aortic stenosis, which occurs when the large blood vessels leading away from the heart narrow, forcing it to work much harder to pump blood. The condition tends to develop with age and can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue and heart failure.  Patients in the study had minimally-invasive surgery that fixes the problem by inserting a replacement valve to send blood around the damaged valve while leaving it in place. This procedure, known as a transcatheter aortic valve replacement, is done by threading a catheter to the heart through a small incision in the chest or from the large artery in the groin - it doesn’t require cutting open the chest.  Afterward, patients could walk significantly further in six-minute walking tests used to assess their functional capacity. On average, they added almost 42 meters (138 feet) to their performance before surgery.  In addition, patients reported clinically meaningful improvements in their quality of life and their ability to complete daily tasks after surgery.  The results offer fresh evidence that transcatheter aortic valve replacement can help ease symptoms like shortness of breath and fatigue that limit the ability to handle physical exertion, said Dr. David Cohen, director of cardiovascular research at Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City, Missouri.  “These symptoms lead to reduced functional capacity (inability to perform physical exertion) and also impact a patient’s overall sense of wellbeing and quality of life,” Cohen, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.  “By replacing the diseased aortic valve, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (and surgical valve replacement) reverses these effects and generally allows the patient to return to his or her ‘normal’ quality of life - limited only by the impact of other conditions that the patient may have,” Cohen said by email.  Overall, the current analysis included 2,775 patients from a total of 20 previously published studies on outcomes for this type of surgery.  Participants were 82 years old, on average, and they were typically considered high-risk surgical patients due to either advanced age or other medical issues.  The smaller studies in the analysis ranged in size from 36 to 484 patients, and most of them followed patients for as long as six to 12 months after surgery.  One limitation of the current analysis is that many of these smaller studies were not controlled experiments designed to prove whether or how transcatheter aortic valve replacement might improve quality of life, lead study author Nicola Straiton of the University of Sydney and colleagues note in Age and Ageing. Straiton didn’t respond to emails seeking comment.  People who don’t get this type of minimally invasive surgery may instead get a more invasive procedure that involves surgeons cutting open the chest to repair a damaged valve.  Surgeons may also perform what’s known as angioplasty, which uses a catheter to insert a tiny balloon and inflate it to open the valve; sometimes surgeons will also insert a stent, or tiny wire mesh cage, to keep the artery propped open.  Results of the current study reaffirm that a minimally-invasive procedure can be a viable option, even for elderly people who are high-risk surgical patients, said Dr. Samir Kapadia, a cardiovascular medicine researcher at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.  “Replacing the aortic valve improves functional capacity,” Kapadia, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is an important minimally invasive treatment option for replacing the aortic valve that is narrowed.”  SOURCE: bit.ly/2EMHTuH Age and Ageing, online January 25, 2018.	1
When actress and author Lena Dunham went public about having endometriosis, a disorder of the uterus, she wanted to make something clear: The pain it causes can be completely debilitating, and women desperately need better treatments.  Soon, it seems, women like Dunham who suffer from endometriosis pain will have a new option for relief. An effective treatment was just approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and it’s expected to arrive at pharmacies as soon as August. The pill, called elagolix (brand name Orilissa) from the drugmaker AbbVie, is the first FDA-approved oral treatment in more than a decade for the moderate to severe pain that comes with endometriosis.  “This [medication] could really be transformative,” said Hugh Taylor, an OB-GYN doctor at Yale Medical School who led the key trials testing the drug. “I’m very excited to be able to start using it in my patients.”  Endometriosis is one of the most common gynecological conditions, affecting one in 10 women of reproductive age. And it can be incredibly painful. The reason is simple: Women with the condition are growing excess tissue in their abdomen that they can’t shed.  Every month, a woman’s uterine lining thickens and sheds during her period if she’s not pregnant. With endometriosis, that tissue thickens and bleeds, but it happens outside of the uterus — on the fallopian tubes, even in the nose, the lungs. Because the extra tissue has no way to exit the body (it can’t go through the vagina since it’s not growing in the uterus) it builds up and becomes trapped, leading to pain and, in some cases, infertility.  There’s no cure for endometriosis. To manage symptoms, women are usually prescribed birth control or over-the-counter painkillers as a first-line approach, but they don’t always work. In severe cases, a doctor may suggest surgery to remove the extra tissue. (Dunham had eight surgeries, and ended up getting a hysterectomy, which was considered an extreme measure.)  Enter elagolix. Endometriosis is an estrogen-driven disease, and the drug works by lowering estrogen levels. Two large double-blind, placebo-control randomized trials, involving 1,200 women, tested whether it can help women control endometriosis pain.  The results, published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine, were pretty remarkable. The patients in those trials scored their pain from 0 (no pain) to 3 (severe pain). On average, they had pain levels of 2.2 out of 3 before starting on the drug — and they experienced a 2-point reduction in pain after taking the treatment for three months.  “It’s a major advance,” said Dr. Louis DePaolo, head of the fertility and infertility branch at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, “and another option women have that’s effective.”  Now, the less good news: The drug won’t cure endometriosis — it’ll only tamp down the pain it causes. Researchers have also found it causes bone loss, and they have no idea about the long-term effects of taking the drug because there are no trials lasting for longer than a year. It’ll also cost women $850 per month if they don’t have insurance coverage. But for some, the risks and costs may be worth it. Here’s why.  Endometriosis is incredibly common — but it can go undiagnosed for years  The three main ways endometriosis manifests are through pelvic pain, infertility, and pelvic masses such as cysts, scar tissue, and fibroids. According to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, some important signs of endometriosis include:  Pain before and during periods  Pain during sex  Infertility  Fatigue  Painful urination during periods  Painful bowel movements during periods  But many women don’t know they have endometriosis. It’s sometimes mistaken or dismissed for regular period pain. Definitively diagnosing the disorder requires invasive surgery; doctors need to peer inside the pelvis through a laparoscopy. (Imaging is rarely helpful in getting a clear diagnosis.) This involves making a small incision in the belly and inserting a tube with a tiny camera to see if the pelvic organs show signs of tissue scarring and buildup. So it’s no surprise it takes between three and 11 years after the onset of symptoms to diagnose endometriosis.  Doctors aren’t sure why some women get it  Adding to the mystery around endometriosis: no one knows exactly what causes endometriosis, but doctors have some theories.  Retrograde menstrual flow: During a period, when a woman is shedding her uterine lining, some of that tissue can flow through her fallopian tubes and into her pelvis, which researchers think may cause endometriosis. But doctors have also found that the rate of retrograde menstruation is about the same in women with and without endometriosis, so they think additional factors spur the disorder in some.  During a period, when a woman is shedding her uterine lining, some of that tissue can flow through her fallopian tubes and into her pelvis, which researchers think m	0
"The popular botanical ginkgo biloba does not improve memory nor does it prevent cognitive decline in older people, according to the largest and longest scientific study ever undertaken to look at the supplement.  An extract derived from the ginkgo tree, ginkgo biloba has been touted since the 1970s by the supplement industry and others as an aid to improving memory, cognitive impairment, dementia and Alzheimer's disease. Ginkgo extract has been used in traditional Chinese medicine for more than 500 years, according to the American Botanical Council.  The study finding is ""disappointing news,"" says Steven DeKosky, dean of the University of Virginia School of Medicine and the study's senior author. The only positive thing the researchers found is that ginkgo appears to be safe, he says.  The results are from the Ginkgo Evaluation of Memory study, funded by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, a center of the National Institutes of Health. The randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled study was conducted at six medical centers and involved more than 3,000 people between ages 72 and 96 for seven years. The report is in today's Journal of the American Medical Association.  The first set of results from the study, published last year, found that a twice-daily dose of 120 milligrams of ginkgo biloba extract was not effective in reducing the incidence of Alzheimer's dementia or dementia overall.  This new paper looked at the same results to see if ginkgo biloba extract had any effect on cognitive decline in older adults, specifically memory, visual-spatial construction, language, attention, psychomotor speed and executive function. It found no effect.  ""It just continues to show that in properly designed, placebo-controlled studies, we can't seem to find an effect for ginkgo biloba,"" says Lon Schneider, an Alzheimer's and gerontology expert at the University of Southern California. The size of this study is larger than all previous ginkgo biloba studies combined, he says.  Douglas MacKay, vice president for scientific and regulatory affairs at the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a supplement industry trade group, disputes the study's findings.  ""There is a large body of previously published evidence, as well as ongoing trials, which suggest that ginkgo biloba is effective for helping to improve cognitive impairment in older adults,"" he says.  U.S. sales for ginkgo biloba were $99 million in 2008, down 8% from 2007 but still placing it the 8th most popular herb and botanical that the Nutrition Business Journal tracks."	0
"(CNN) -- Marcia Gilbert has spent most of her life in Charlotte, North Carolina, but for the end of summer, she decided to make a special trip.  Gilbert, 56, spent the weekend before Labor Day in New York City. She roamed from Chinatown to the Upper East Side, went sightseeing in Central Park and painted the town with her husband of 33 years, their two 20-something children and assorted friends.  One evening, they found themselves at Del Posto, a chic Italian restaurant. Glancing at her watch, over the sparkle of conversation, wine glasses and half-eaten dessert, Gilbert marveled at the time: just a few minutes to midnight.  ""It was awfully late for me,"" she laughed as she told the story. ""It was just a great moment to know that I was holding up enough to be there, to feel great and make memories.""  Late-night hours, any hours, are especially precious to Gilbert, who could have been forgiven for feeling just a bit weary. For 15 years, she's been fighting breast cancer.  After years of ups and downs, Gilbert is doing well and gives most of the credit to her most recent medicine: bevacizumab, better known by its brand name, Avastin. But gratitude is tinged with worry, because the Food and Drug Administration is considering the unusual step of revoking its approval of Avastin as a treatment for metastatic breast cancer.  ""It's disheartening, and it's a scary thought,"" says Gilbert. ""Until just recently, I didn't know it was so precarious.""  Avastin, which works by cutting off a tumor's blood supply, was first approved as a cancer treatment in 2004 as a therapy for colon cancer. Since then, it has also been approved as a treatment for certain types of lung, kidney and brain cancer.  In 2008, the FDA granted Avastin what's known as accelerated approval as a therapy for metastatic breast cancer. The move was based on preliminary studies that found the drug increased the time that patients went without symptoms getting worse. As a condition of the approval, the company that makes Avastin -- Genentech -- agreed to conduct more extensive research.  The results of those two larger trials, known as RIBBON-1 and AVADO, were made public this year, and to some, they were disappointing. In RIBBON-1, time without symptoms getting worse, known as progression-free survival, or PFS, improved by less than three months.  In AVADO, it improved by just 24 days. In neither study did patients actually live longer, and there was a high rate of side effects, including high blood pressure and internal bleeding.  In July, an FDA advisory panel voted 12-1 to recommend revoking the preliminary approval. The FDA promises a final decision by September 17.  Gilbert had just passed her 40th birthday when she felt a lump in her breast. It was cancer.  She had it removed, went through a round of radiation and chemotherapy, and was symptom-free for the next nine years.  ""I almost describe it as the little c,"" is how she tells it today. ""When I got the recurrence, it was the Big C. It was a real surprise when it came back again.""  This time, the signal was pain underneath her armpit. Tests revealed several small tumors in the bone.  Doctors told Gilbert she'd be lucky to be alive in five years, but with chemotherapy and radiation, she fought off the cancer, again. A year later, she watched her daughter Neely perform her senior dance recital, and not long after, walk across the stage to collect her high school diploma.  ""All those things you take for granted,"" Gilbert says. ""I was just so blessed to see her graduate.""  But chemotherapy took a toll. At one point, Gilbert was hospitalized several days with a low white blood cell count and high fevers.  A few years later, she felt chest pains, and doctors thought she was having a heart attack. As it turned out, Gilbert had no heart damage, but there were days she was so exhausted she couldn't leave the house.  Late last spring, tests at Duke University found signs of cancer in her liver. Dr. Kimberly Blackwell, a breast cancer specialist at Duke, put her on Avastin, along with Navelbine, another chemotherapy drug. Gilbert says the combination stopped her illness in its tracks.  Because Avastin is approved to treat other cancers, losing the breast cancer indication would not, technically, remove it from a doctor's toolkit. But here's the catch: Avastin costs more than $8,000 a month. At that price, insurance coverage is crucial, and patients and doctors fear that an FDA reversal will lead to most insurers no longer signing the checks.  Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for the Association of Health Insurance Plans, the largest trade group, said insurers would wait for guidance from the FDA, but adds, ""If the FDA pulls back its approval for this particular indication, it would trigger a review of plan policies. Policies get reviewed whenever there is additional information.""  The issue has split advocates for breast cancer patients. Susan G.

A new study raised questions about the benefits of a relatively common procedure for heart patients—implanting tiny devices that prop open clogged arteries to relieve chest pain.  The 200-patient study conducted by U.K. researchers found that patients with stable chest pain, or angina, who received stent devices experienced no significant improvement in exercise time on a treadmill, compared with similar patients who received no stents during sham procedures.  All patients had received intensive treatment with heart drugs for six weeks before the real or fake procedures.  “Symptoms didn’t improve as much as expected” in the patients who received stents, Rasha Al-Lamee, an interventional cardiologist at Imperial College London and one of the study’s lead investigators, said in an interview. She presented results of the study at the Transcatheter Cardiovascular Therapeutics medical conference in Denver; results were simultaneously published online Thursday by The Lancet.  Dr. Al-Lamee cautioned that the findings apply to a minority of the population of patients who now receive stents, those with narrowing of only one artery and certain other characteristics. She said the study doesn’t apply to patients having heart attacks, who may benefit from stents, and to patients with chest pain who have disease in more than one artery.  The study also found that stents improved blood supply to the heart versus placebo, she said.  Still, the study could affect a portion of a multibillion business for stent manufacturers including Medtronic PLC, Abbott Laboratories and Boston Scientific Corp. About 500,000 stents are implanted for stable angina each year world-wide, the study’s researchers wrote in The Lancet.  Abbott spokesman Jonathon Hamilton said the new study had patients with mild disease “who weren’t reflective of patients who typically undergo stenting procedures,” and that some patients received stents in the trial who wouldn’t have gotten them otherwise because of the study design.  Medtronic and Boston Scientific all referred questions about the study to a statement issued Thursday by the Society for Cardiovascular Angiography and Interventions, whose members include cardiologists who perform stent procedures. The SCAI said it questioned the study’s conclusions, and that SCAI believes stents are the preferred treatment for cardiac patients who need more than medicines to improve health and quality of life.  But some doctors said the study’s outcome should discourage use of stents in many patients.  The results show “unequivocally” that there are no benefits for stent procedures compared with drugs for stable angina, two cardiologists wrote in an editorial accompanying the results in The Lancet.  The cardiologists, David L. Brown of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, and Rita F. Redberg of University of California, San Francisco, called for cardiology-treatment guidelines to downgrade the recommendation of stents for stable chest pain, and focus on treating these patients with medicine.  Past studies have proven that stents can save lives when used in acute situations like heart attacks. But other studies have challenged their uses in patients with less severe disease and symptoms, including a landmark study released in 2007. Changes to treatment guidelines since then have curbed the over-use of stent procedures, according to a 2015 study .  While the new study’s findings are being debated, it is notable for its design: It is the first to compare stents with placebo while keeping patients in the dark about whether or not they received a stent. All patients had catheters inserted in an artery and were heavily sedated before being taken into a catheter lab. But only about half were given actual stents, while the rest were left on cath-lab tables for about 15 minutes, then had the catheters removed.  Researchers chose this design to minimize the “placebo effect” seen in past studies, in which a portion of symptom improvement in patients receiving stents could be attributed to their expectation that the stent would make them feel better.  All patients in the study took drugs including aspirin, anti-platelet drugs, cholesterol-lowering statins and beta blockers for about six weeks. This was followed by baseline treadmill tests and either the stent or sham procedure. They underwent treadmill tests again six weeks after the procedures. Researchers used exercise time as the main measure because physical exertion is usually what triggers angina, and it usually goes away when patients rest, Dr. Al-Lamee said.  Patients receiving stents improved their exercise times by an average of 28 seconds, while those who didn’t improved their times by an average of nearly 12 seconds. But the difference wasn’t statistically significant, which means it could have been due to chance.  Write to Peter Loftus at peter.loftus@wsj.com	0
LONDON (Reuters) - A protein in urine could be a strong indicator of prostate cancer risk, according to British scientists who say their findings could one day be developed into a quick and simple test for the disease.  Medical equipment sits in labelled bins inside of a doctor's office in New York in this March 17, 2010 file photo. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson  Scientists from the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Research Institute and the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) said the protein, called microseminoprotein-beta or MSMB, is found at reduced levels in men diagnosed with the disease and are also lower in men with more aggressive forms of the cancer.  “The protein is easy to detect because it is found in urine and would potentially be a very simple test to carry out on men to identify those most at risk of developing the disease,” said Hayley Whitaker of the Cambridge institute, who led the study.  Whitaker said that while it could be around five years before the results of this study are translated into a test for doctors to use in clinics, she hoped it would then also help them to determine which patients have aggressive tumors.  Prostate cancer killed an estimated 258,000 men around the world in 2008 and is the second most common cause of cancer death in men in the United States. In Britain, around 35,000 men are diagnosed with it and some 10,000 die from the disease.  The most effective screening tests currently available are based on a single biomarker called prostate specific antigen (PSA). But PSA testing is problematic because it has low specificity, which generates high false positive rates and leads to unnecessary surgical and radiotherapy treatment.  A U.S. study published last year found that routine PSA prostate screening has resulted in more than one million American men being diagnosed with tumors who might otherwise have suffered no ill effects from them.  “At the moment, PSA testing is the best method we have to detect prostate cancer but it has significant limitations, so there is an urgent need to find new biomarkers such as MSMB that could be used in screening and diagnosis,” said Rosalind Eeles of the ICR and The Royal Marsden Hospital, who also worked on the study.  The protein — which regulates prostate cell death — is produced by normal prostate cells.  The scientists took tissue and urine samples from around 350 men both with and without prostate cancer to test MSMB levels.  The results, published in the Public Library of Science (PLoS) ONE journal, showed that MSMB is found at significantly lower levels in the urine of men diagnosed with prostate cancer than those without the disease. They also showed men with aggressive tumors were also likely to have lower levels of the protein in their urine.  Commenting on the study, Kate Holmes of the UK’s Prostate Cancer Charity, said they could prove very valuable in future.  “Given the known limitations of the PSA blood test, finding a technique to accurately diagnose prostate cancer is the Holy Grail of research into the disease,” she said in a statement.  “An accurate, reliable urine test for prostate cancer would be an invaluable tool if it is proven to be successful on a large scale.”	1
"For years, negative reports have surrounded artificial sweeteners, claiming evidence of everything from being a carcinogen to causing cardiovascular disease. But now new research suggests a popular sugar substitute could lead to new treatments for some of the most common types of cancers.  In findings presented at the National Meeting and Exposition of the American Chemical Society (ACS), a team of researchers from the University of Florida College of Medicine examined how saccharin, the artificial sweetener that is the main ingredient in Sweet 'N Low®, Sweet Twin® and Necta®, reacted with a protein found in aggressive cancer cells.  ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT  The protein, called carbonic anhydrase IX (CA IX), regulates pH in and around cancer cells, allowing tumors to thrive and potentially metastasize to other parts of the body. It is found in a wide range of aggressive cancers, including breast, lung, liver, prostate, pancreatic and kidney cancer.  “If you disrupt this pH balance via blocking CA IX activity, you can stop these cancer cells from growing and proliferating,” study author Brian Mahon, a graduate research assistant at the University of Florida, told FoxNews.com.  Mahon said the research stemmed from a study from the University of Florence in Italy that suggested saccharin would selectively block the activity of CA IX. He said his team, led by University of Florida’s Dr. Robert McKenna, wanted to further investigate saccharin’s effect in treating cancer.  ""It never ceases to amaze me how a simple molecule such as saccharin— something many people put in their coffee every day— may have untapped uses, including as a possible lead compound to target aggressive cancers,"" McKenna said.  CA IX is not normally found in healthy human cells. McKenna said that’s why it’s a prime target for anti-cancer drugs, as they would cause little to no side effects to healthy tissue surrounding the tumor. Previous attempts to find an element that blocks CA IX without damaging other cells have been unsuccessful.  Researchers used X-ray crystallography to determine how saccharin binds to CA IX, and are using that information to develop ways to fine-tune and improve its anti-cancer treatment potential. The goal is to develop drugs that could slow the growth of these cancers and potentially make them less resistant to chemo or radiation therapies. Currently, saccharin’s effects are being tested on breast and liver cancer cells.  ""This result opens up the potential to develop a novel anti-cancer drug that is derived from a common condiment that could have a lasting impact on treating several cancers,"" McKenna said.  Researchers warn the findings don’t warrant adding large quantities of artificial sweeteners to your diet, but they say their findings may offer promise for the development of an anti-cancer drug derived from an ingredient that ironically was once considered a possible carcinogen."	1
“We were hoping for a very different story,” said Dr. Gregory N. Connolly, director of Harvard’s Center for Global Tobacco Control and a co-author of the study. “I ran a treatment program for years, and we invested” millions in treatment services.  Doctors who treat smokers said that the study findings were not unexpected, given the haphazard way many smokers used the products. “Patient compliance is a very big issue,” said Dr. Richard Hurt, director of the Nicotine Dependence Center at the Mayo Clinic , who was not involved in the study.  Photo  Dr. Hurt said products like nicotine gum and patches “are absolutely essential, but we use them in combinations and doses that match treatment to what the individual patient needs,” unlike smokers who are self-treating.  The products have been controversial since at least 2002, when researchers at the University of California, San Diego , reported from a large survey that they appeared to offer no benefit. The study did not follow people over time. A government-appointed panel that included nicotine replacement as part of federal guidelines for treatment also came under fire, because panel members had gotten payments from the product manufacturers.  “Some studies have questioned these treatments, but the bulk of clinical trials have unequivocally endorsed them,” said Dr. Michael Fiore, director of the University of Wisconsin ’s Center for Tobacco Research and Intervention and the chairman of the panel that wrote the guidelines. Dr. Fiore, who has reported receiving payments from drug makers, said that “there are millions of smokers out there desperate to quit, and it would be a tragedy if they felt, because of one study, that this option is ineffective.”  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In the new study, conducted in Massachusetts , the researchers followed a representative sample of 1,916 adults, including 787 people who said at the start of the study that they had recently quit smoking. They interviewed the participants three times, about once every two years during the 2000s, asking the smokers and quitters about their use of gum, patches and other such products, their periods of not smoking and their relapses.  At each stage, about one-third of the people trying to quit had relapsed, the study found. The use of replacement products made no difference, whether they were taken for the recommended two-month period (they usually were not), or with the guidance of a cessation counselor.  One subgroup, heavy smokers (defined as those who had their first cigarette within a half-hour of waking up) who used replacement products without counseling, was twice as likely to relapse as heavy smokers who did not use them.  “Our study essentially shows that what happens in the real world is very different” from what happens in clinical trials, said Hillel R.

There’s another type of prescription drugs, besides opioid painkillers, that’s involved in thousands of drug overdose deaths in the US every year.  The drugs are benzodiazepines, which are widely known by their brand names Xanax and Valium and commonly prescribed to help treat anxiety. These drugs were involved in nearly 9,000 overdose deaths in 2015, according to federal data. But there’s a catch: Such overdoses seem to be very closely tied to the opioid epidemic, with the majority of benzodiazepine overdose deaths involving both benzodiazepines and opioids.  A new study published in BMJ looked at just how much the concurrent use of these two drugs increases the risk of overdose versus the risk of only using opioids. Drawing on a huge sample of nearly 320,000 patients who were continuously enrolled in private health insurance plans from 2001 and 2013, researchers compared those who were prescribed just opioids versus those who were prescribed both, and what their additional risk of an emergency room visit or inpatient admission was in the period they were prescribed both.  The study found that among all opioid users, concurrent use of benzodiazepines more than doubled the risk of an emergency room or inpatient visit for a drug overdose.  The study also found that eliminating concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid use could reduce the risk for an opioid overdose–related emergency room or inpatient visit by 15 percent. If that reduced risk applies to overdose deaths as well, eliminating concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use could have prevented up to 2,630 opioid painkiller–related overdose deaths in 2015.  Keith Humphreys, a drug policy expert at Stanford University and one of the authors of the study, said this reveals an underappreciated policy lever for reducing drug overdoses: making sure patients prescribed to opioids aren’t also prescribed to benzodiazepines, and vice versa. “Even if we didn’t change opioid prescribing at all, the data here suggest that we could cut overdoses dramatically just [by] getting prescribers to not put people on a benzodiazepine at the same time,” Humphreys said.  Yet the study suggests the opposite has happened. From 2001 to 2013, co-prescriptions to opioids and benzodiazepines among the studied pool of patients increased from 9 percent to 17 percent — a nearly 89 percent jump.  For some patients, eliminating these co-prescriptions could involve some tough trade-offs. If someone genuinely suffers from pain and anxiety, doctors and patients will need to work out which condition is more important to treat and which one can be treated with alternatives — to avoid a potentially deadly overdose. (Hopefully while keeping in mind that there’s no good scientific evidence that opioids can treat chronic pain, so opioids aren’t the right treatment for chronic pain in the first place.)  There are some caveats to the study. For one, emergency room visits and inpatient admissions for opioid overdoses likely aren’t a perfect one-to-one proxy for overdoses that didn’t involve a trip to a doctor. The study also only looked at legally prescribed opioid painkillers and benzodiazepines, missing the effects of concurrent use of illegally obtained pills or drugs. And since the research relied on patients who were continuously insured throughout the study period, it’s possible the findings don’t exactly apply to people with spottier coverage. (Although sensitivity analyses in the study for people who had lapses in insurance produced similar results.)  Finally, since the study looked at correlation (not causation), it’s possible that it missed some other factor driving up overdose deaths among concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid users — perhaps, for whatever reason, these users may be more likely to misuse their drugs.  Still, it’s well established that benzodiazepine and opioids compound each other’s overdose risk. So it’s not really controversial to conclude that simultaneously using opioids and benzodiazepines dramatically increases the risk of drug overdose — or, conversely, that stopping the concurrent use of these two drugs could reduce the risk of overdose.  Given that the opioid epidemic has quickly turned into the deadliest drug crisis in US history, it’s important — and potentially lifesaving — for doctors and policymakers to at least consider the study’s findings.

"By Maureen Salamon  HealthDay Reporter  WEDNESDAY, July 6, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- For the millions of Americans with chronic low back pain, a silver bullet to alleviate the condition has yet to be identified, a new study suggests.  Reviewing 26 studies comparing spinal manipulative therapy (SMT) to other treatments such as medication, exercise or physical therapy, researchers from the Netherlands found that SMT appears to be no better or worse than other options at relieving back pain long-term.  The analyses indicated that SMT -- which involves manual manipulation of the spine and surrounding muscles -- has only a short-term impact on pain relief, although it eases pain faster than other treatments.  ""In short, no single therapy is better than another, although some individuals are likely to have more success with one therapy than another,"" said study author Sidney Rubinstein, a research fellow at VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam.  ""Current studies are focusing on which subjects are more likely to benefit from spinal manipulation, exercise, or other therapies,"" he added. ""Spinal manipulation should be considered a viable treatment option for those with non-specific, chronic low back pain.""  The study was recently published in the journal Spine.  More than 6,000 patients were included in the compilation of results, which the study authors said were sparse in data indicating participants' overall recovery, quality of life and ability to return to work. The studies also varied in quality, with only nine of 26 considered ""low [in] bias,"" according to background information accompanying the study.  In all evaluations, patients were randomly assigned to SMT or another comparison treatment, including active treatments such as exercise or inactive placebo treatments.  About two-thirds of the studies were not included in a previous review published in 2004, and all patients had suffered from lower back pain for 12 weeks or longer.  While chiropractors often perform SMT on patients, it is also administered by physical therapists and osteopaths. But which treatment is right for any patient depends not only on their specific pain, but their doctor's recommendations and their own comfort level with various options, said Stephen Perle, a spokesman for the American Chiropractic Association.  The cost of SMT sessions varies widely depending on the region, Perle said.  ""Nobody has the answer at this time,"" Perle said. ""I guess people in almost every profession like to say, 'We have a compelling treatment and it will work almost every time,' but that's just not the case.""  ""With low back pain, there are many reasons people don't get better,"" added Perle, also a professor of clinical sciences in the College of Chiropractic at the University of Bridgeport in Connecticut. ""So the finding was not unexpected.""  An unrelated study of 401 patients with low back pain, published July 5 in Annals of Internal Medicine, suggested that massage may be better than medication or exercise for short-term pain relief.  Seattle researchers found that those who received either relaxation massage or structural massage, which involved manipulation of muscles and ligaments, had less pain and better functioning for up to a year compared to those getting ""usual medical care,"" which included medication and physical therapy.  More information  The U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more information about low back pain."	0
"You might not want to rush into knee surgery. Physical therapy can be just as good for a common injury and at far less cost and risk, the most rigorous study to compare these treatments concludes.  Therapy didn't always help and some people wound up having surgery for the problem, called a torn meniscus. But those who stuck with therapy had improved as much six months and one year later as those who had arthroscopic surgery right away, researchers found.  ""Both are very good choices. It would be quite reasonable to try physical therapy first because the chances are quite good that you'll do quite well,"" said one study leader, Dr. Jeffrey Katz, a joint specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.  He was to discuss the study Tuesday at an American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons conference in Chicago. Results were published online by the New England Journal of Medicine.  A meniscus is one of the crescent-shaped cartilage discs that cushion the knee. About one-third of people over 50 have a tear in one, and arthritis makes this more likely. Usually the tear doesn't cause symptoms but it can be painful.  When that happens, it's tough to tell if the pain is from the tear or the arthritis — or whether surgery is needed or will help. Knee surgery for a torn meniscus is done about half a million times each year in the U.S.  The new federally funded study compared surgery with a less drastic option. Researchers at seven major universities and orthopedic surgery centers around the U.S. assigned 351 people with arthritis and meniscus tears to get either surgery or physical therapy. The therapy was nine sessions on average plus exercises to do at home, which experts say is key to success.  After six months, both groups had similar rates of functional improvement. Pain scores also were similar.  Thirty percent of patients assigned to physical therapy wound up having surgery before the six months was up, often because they felt therapy wasn't helping them. Yet they ended up the same as those who got surgery right away, as well as the rest of the physical therapy group who stuck with it and averted an operation.  ""There are patients who would like to get better in a 'fix me' approach"" and surgery may be best for them, said Elena Losina, another study leader from Brigham and Women's Hospital.  However, an Australian preventive medicine expert contends that the study's results should change practice. Therapy ""is a reasonable first strategy, with surgery reserved for the minority who don't have improvement,"" Rachelle Buchbinder of Monash University in Melbourne wrote in a commentary in the medical journal.  As it is now, ""millions of people are being exposed to potential risks associated with a treatment that may or may not offer specific benefit, and the costs are substantial,"" she wrote.  Surgery costs about $5,000, compared with $1,000 to $2,000 for a typical course of physical therapy, Katz said.  One study participant — Bob O'Keefe, 68, of suburban Boston — was glad to avoid surgery for his meniscus injury three years ago.  ""I felt better within two weeks"" on physical therapy, he said. ""My knee is virtually normal today."" He still does the recommended exercises several times a week.  Robert Dvorkin had both treatments for injuries on each knee several years apart. Dvorkin, 56, director of operations at the Coalition for the Homeless in New York City, had surgery followed by physical therapy for a tear in his right knee and said it was months before he felt no pain.  Then, several years ago, he hurt his left knee while exercising. ""I had been doing some stretching and doing some push-ups and I just felt it go 'pop.'"" he recalls. ""I was limping. It was extremely painful.""  An imaging test showed a less severe tear and a different surgeon recommended physical therapy. Dvorkin said it worked like a charm — he avoided surgery and recovered faster than from his first injury. The treatment involved two to three hour-long sessions a week, including strengthening exercises, balancing and massage. He said the sessions weren't that painful and his knee felt better after each one.  ""Within a month I was healed,"" Dvorkin said. ""I was completely back to normal."""	0
"En Español  TUESDAY, Jan. 5, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- For the sixth year in a row, a panel of health experts has named the heart-healthy DASH diet the best overall eating plan, according to U.S. News & World Report's 2016 Best Diets ranking.  The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet was designed to lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels by limiting fats, red meat and sugar in favor of healthy grains, poultry, low-fat dairy and nuts, the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute says.  ""Our rankings put hard numbers on the belief that no one diet is ideal for everybody, but the best food plans overall are sustainable,"" Angela Haupt, senior health editor at U.S. News & World Report, said in a news release from the media company.  Every year, U.S. News & World Report asks experts to rank various diets to help the tens of millions of dieters in the United States and around the globe make informed dietary decisions that can help them achieve healthier lifestyles.  The panel of experts -- including nutritionists and doctors specializing in diabetes, heart health and weight loss -- scored each diet for short-term and long-term weight loss. They also considered how easy each diet was to follow, as well as safety and nutritional value.  ""Besides the rankings and data, each diet has a detailed profile that includes how it works, evidence that supports or refutes its claims and a nutritional snapshot -- tools that, along with the advice of a physician or nutritionist, can help consumers invest in diets that suit their lifestyles and further their health and wellness goals,"" Haupt said.  The panel evaluated 38 of the most popular or trendy diets this year. After ranking them in nine categories, the experts found the MIND diet tied for second place for best overall diet with the cholesterol-lowering TLC diet. The MIND diet includes some features of the DASH diet and Mediterranean diet, such as high consumption of fruits, vegetables and fish, but focuses on foods that promote brain health.  The MIND diet ranked first in the ""Easiest Diet to Follow"" category in a three-way tie with Weight Watchers and the Fertility diet, which asserts that certain dietary changes can boost fertility.  The Fertility diet, which calls for the elimination of trans fats, also ranked as the best diet for diabetes, the report revealed. The Biggest Loser diet and the DASH diet came in second and third, respectively, in the diabetes category.  The DASH diet scored highest when it comes to healthy eating, followed by the TLC diet. The Mediterranean and the MIND diet tied for third place in this category.  The Weight Watchers diet ranked highest out of all weight-loss diets but tied with the Mayo Clinic diet as the ""Best Commercial Diet.""  When it comes to speedy weight loss, the HMR program and Biggest Loser diet shared the top ranking, followed by the Atkins diet in second place and Weight Watchers in third.  On the opposite end of the list, the Whole30 diet -- a 30-day program that bans processed foods, legumes, grains, dairy, alcohol and added sugar -- ranked as the worst overall diet on the list, the new report said.  The Raw Food diet and low-carb Atkins diet also scored poorly overall and ranked low in categories like ""Best Diets for Healthy Eating."" The Raw Food diet was also considered the most difficult diet to follow, though it was one of the top ranked weight-loss diets, the panel found.

Approved by the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday for treating advanced-stage melanoma, the virus — called Imlygic , which was developed in part in a Massachusetts lab — is a modified version of the herpes virus that both attacks the cancer and sparks the immune system into action against tumors.  Viruses are usually thought of as agents of disease. But for the first time, scientists are poised to bring to the US market a virus that can help thwart cancer, a development that could herald a new age of viral therapies.  In clinical trials, it has helped some cancer patients achieve remission with few of the nasty side effects common to existing treatments. And as the first tumor-killing virus to receive the FDA’s blessing, Imlygic could accelerate the development of other viral therapies.  Advertisement  “This is huge for the whole field, and for cancer patients,” said John Bell, a senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute in Canada. “The field is exploding, and this would be another arrow in the quiver that oncologists use.”  Imlygic is part of a new group of immune-stimulating viral therapies that could change how cancer is treated and managed. One involves a genetically tweaked poliovirus being tested in patients with brain tumors, while another, based on a version of the common cold virus, is now under evaluation in people with bladder cancer.  Melanoma is a deadly form of skin cancer that kills around 10,000 people per year in the United States. In a trial of 436 patients with the disease, 16 percent of participants who received Imlygic saw their tumors shrink for at least six months, compared with just 2 percent of those who received an older immune-boosting drug. Among those whose cancer had spread locally but not to internal organs, the response rate was better — 33 percent.  “It’s a low-toxicity treatment, and for the right patients you see quite stunning results,” said Robert Coffin, a virologist who created Imlygic at BioVex, the Woburn-based company he founded.  In 2011, the California biotech giant Amgen bought BioVex — and the rights to Imlygic, known generically as talimogene laherparepvec, or T-VEC — in a deal worth up to $1 billion. Amgen will charge patients $65,000 for a course of treatment, which analysts said is in line with expectations.  Advertisement  “These days in oncology we’ve seen some prices quite a bit higher than that,” said Eric Schmidt, an analyst with Cowen & Company. “And Amgen’s not a company that likes to price gouge.”  Schmidt said Imlygic’s market potential as a standalone drug is “very, very modest. It’s being developed in combination with other immunotherapies, where we think there’s a little more of a commercial opportunity, but we still need to see more data.”  Imlygic is approved for skin tumors that are inoperable in patients whose cancer has returned following surgery.  Sue Bohlin, a retired small-business owner in Farmingdale, N.J., is one of those patients. She received the viral therapy in early 2011 after conventional treatments failed to eliminate the skin tumors that had spread from her back to her breast.  “The first time I took it, I got a really serious case of the chills and a high fever, but only for six or eight hours,” said Bohlin, now 62. “After that, there were no side effects.”  Such muted side effects point to a major benefit of this new approach, doctors and patients said. Aside from chills and fever, the other common symptom cited in the study was skin irritation.  Bohlin’s doctors planned to inject each of her tumor sites every two weeks, but after several rounds of treatments more tumors appeared. In a last-ditch effort meant to jump-start Bohlin’s immune system, they injected her on consecutive weeks. The tumors started shrinking in the following weeks, and about three months later they were gone.  “I think we’re on the cusp of potentially curing patients” with these viruses and other immune therapies, said Dr. Howard Kaufman, chief surgical officer of the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey and a lead researcher on Bohlin’s trial. “But short of that, this might be like diabetes, where we can control it and people live normal lives.”  Imlygic is based on a form of the herpes simplex virus that commonly causes cold sores. It is genetically altered to replicate only in tumor cells while also producing a protein that activates T-cells, the search-and-destroy specialists of the immune system. Those T-cells pick up melanoma cells’ molecular scent and hunt them down before going off in search of tumor cells hiding elsewhere in the body.  Advertisement  “This wakes up the immune system and says, ‘Hey! Active infection here, come check this out!’ ” said Dr. Antonio Chiocca, chairman of neurosurgery at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.  In many of the newer experiments, researchers are combining cancer-killing viruses like Imlygic with other immune-activating agents known as checkpoint inhibitors. These therapies typically open 	0
"Feb. 17, 2011 (Orlando, Fla.) -- Taking a pomegranate pill a day may help slow the progression of prostate cancer, preliminary research suggests.  The study is the latest to demonstrate pomegranate's promising antitumor effects, says study head Michael Carducci, MD, professor of oncology and urology at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutes.  In 2009, other researchers reported that pomegranate juice may also prevent prostate cancer from getting worse.  The new study involved 92 men with cancer that had not spread beyond the prostate and rising PSA levels. Rising levels of PSA (prostate-specific antigen) are a sign that prostate cancer may be getting worse.  The men took either one capsule containing 1 gram of pomegranate extract or three pomegranate capsules daily.  At the start of the study, the men's PSA levels were doubling every 12 months. After six months of taking the capsules, it took 19 months for their PSA levels to double.  ""The results were similar regardless of whether the men took one capsule or three,"" Carducci tells WebMD.  However, men who took three pills daily were more likely to suffer mild to moderate diarrhea: 14% vs. 2% of those who took one pill.  Carducci credits antioxidants in the pomegranate for its anticancer effect.  The study was presented at the Genitourinary Cancers Symposium."	0
Photo  Personal Health Jane Brody on health and aging.  Yoga enthusiasts link the practice to a long list of health benefits, including greater flexibility and range of motion, stronger muscles, better posture and balance, reduced emotional and physical stress, and increased self-awareness and self-esteem.  But definitively proving these benefits is challenging, requiring years of costly research. A pharmaceutical company is unlikely to fund a study that doesn’t involve a drug, and in any event, the research requires a large group of volunteers tracked over a very long time.  The subjects must provide health measurements at the outset, learn the proper poses, continue to do them regularly for years and be regularly evaluated.  No one knows these challenges better than Dr. Loren M. Fishman, a physiatrist at Columbia University who specializes in rehabilitative medicine. For years, he has been gathering evidence on yoga and bone health, hoping to determine whether yoga might be an effective therapy for osteoporosis.  The idea is not widely accepted in the medical community, but then, researchers know comparatively little about complementary medicine in general. So in 2005, Dr. Fishman began a small pilot study of yoga moves that turned up some encouraging results. Eleven practitioners had increased bone density in their spine and hips, he reported in 2009, compared with seven controls who did not practice yoga.  Knowing that more than 700,000 spinal fractures and more than 300,000 hip fractures occur annually in the United States, Dr. Fishman hoped that similar findings from a much larger study might convince doctors that this low-cost and less dangerous alternative to bone-loss drugs is worth pursuing.  Those medications can produce adverse side effects like gastrointestinal distress and fractures of the femur. Indeed, a recent study published in Clinical Interventions in Aging found that among 126,188 women found to have osteoporosis, all of whom had Medicare Part D drug coverage, only 28 percent started bone drug therapy within a year of diagnosis.  Many of those who avoided drugs were trying to avoid gastrointestinal problems.  On the other hand, yoga’s “side effects,” Dr. Fishman and colleagues wrote recently, “include better posture, improved balance, enhanced coordination, greater range of motion, higher strength, reduced levels of anxiety and better gait.”  Weight-bearing activity is often recommended to patients with bone loss, and Dr. Fishman argues that certain yoga positions fit the bill.  “Yoga puts more pressure on bone than gravity does,” he said in an interview. “By opposing one group of muscles against another, it stimulates osteocytes, the bone-making cells.”  Most experts argue that it’s difficult, perhaps impossible, for adults to gain significant bone mass. Undeterred, Dr. Fishman invested a chunk of his own money and with three collaborators — Yi-Hsueh Lu of The Rockefeller University, Bernard Rosner of Brigham and Women’s Hospital, and Dr. Gregory Chang of New York University — solicited volunteers worldwide via the Internet for a follow-up to his small pilot study.  Of the 741 people who joined his experiment from 2005 to 2015, 227 (202 of them women) followed through with doing the 12 assigned yoga poses daily or at least every other day. The average age of the 227 participants upon joining the study was 68, and 83 percent had osteoporosis or its precursor, osteopenia.  The 12 poses, by their English names, were tree, triangle, warrior II, side-angle, twisted triangle, locust, bridge, supine hand-to-foot I, supine hand-to-foot II, straight-legged twist, bent-knee twist and corpse pose. Each pose was held for 30 seconds. The daily regimen, once learned, took 12 minutes to complete.  The researchers collected data at the start of the study on the participants’ bone density measurements, blood and urine chemistry and X-rays of their spines and hips. They were each given a DVD of the 12 yoga poses used in the pilot study and an online program in which to record what they did and how often.  A decade after the start of the study, bone density measurements were again taken and emailed to the researchers; many participants also had repeat X-rays done. The findings, as reported last month in Topics of Geriatric Rehabilitation, showed improved bone density in the spine and femur of the 227 participants who were moderately or fully compliant with the assigned yoga exercises.  Improvements were seen in bone density in the hip as well, but they were not statistically significant.  Before the study, the participants had had 109 fractures, reported by them or found on X-rays.  At the time the study was submitted for publication, “with more than 90,000 hours of yoga practiced largely by people with osteoporosis or osteopenia, there have been no reported or X-ray detected fractures or serious injuries of any kind related to the practice of yoga in any of the 741 participants,” Dr. Fishman and his col	0
"Dec. 21, 2009 -- A fatty substance found naturally in the lungs may provide a natural defense against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection.  New research suggests the substance, a lipid known as POPG, may prevent RSV infection as well as limit the spread of the virus once infection has occurred.  ""Our findings demonstrate that POPG is a potent antiviral agent both as  a prophylactic and after infection has occurred,"" researcher Dennis Voelker, PhD, professor of medicine at National Jewish Health in Denver, says in a news release. ""While these are still early studies, several characteristics of POPG make me believe that it has real potential as both an antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment.""  RSV is the major cause of hospitalization in young children under age 2 and is an increasingly problematic infection in adults with chronic lung disease, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems. There is no vaccine or easy, effective treatment for RSV.  POPGis one of several lipids found in the fluid that lines the air sacs of the lungs. Researchers say that until now, the function of POPG has been unclear.  In the study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers examined the effects of POPG on RSV infection in human lung cells in the lab and in mice infected with the virus.  They found that inoculating human lung cells with POPG before exposure to RSV prevented infection with the virus as well as the cell death and inflammation normally associated with RSV infection. Applying POPG to the cells after RSV infection also inhibited the spread of the virus to neighboring healthy cells.  In addition, the study showed treating infected mice with POPG dramatically reduced infection and prevented the spread of the inflammatory cells into the lungs.  Researchers say POPG appears to work by binding to RSV and preventing it from binding to other cells. The findings also suggest that POPG’s role in the lungs may be to help the lungs tolerate the daily barrage of inhaled irritants.  POPG is already used in other treatments and has been safely given to millions of premature infants to protect their lungs. It is also inexpensive and easy to use.  Therefore, together with the results of this study, researchers say the compound merits further research as a treatment for RSV infection in humans."	1
"En Español  By Serena Gordon  HealthDay Reporter  MONDAY, Aug. 1, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- When women take a supplement of the omega 3 fatty acid DHA during pregnancy, their babies have fewer cold symptoms and shorter illnesses, new research indicates.  At 1 month and 3 months of age, about 38 percent of babies exposed to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the womb experienced cold symptoms, compared to about 45 percent of the babies whose mothers were given a placebo supplement while they were pregnant.  ""The data suggested that for most of the symptoms we looked at, duration of symptoms was less when mothers received DHA. And, in the case of colds, the probability of a cold was slightly less. The effects seemed to be strongest early on after birth,"" said study senior author Usha Ramakrishnan, an associate professor in the Hubert Department of Global Health at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in Atlanta.  Ramakrishnan said it's probably too soon to recommend routine use of DHA supplements for pregnant women, because the findings weren't ""dramatic."" But, she added that the supplements did appear to be safe for pregnant women to take.  Results of the study will be published online on Aug. 1, and are scheduled to appear in the September issue of Pediatrics. The research was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the March of Dimes Foundation.  Omega 3 fatty acids are a class of nutrients considered essential for neural and retinal development during pregnancy. They are often obtained through diet by eating fish. But, concerns about mercury contamination in fish have led to recommendations that advise pregnant women to limit their fish consumption. Pregnant women are also advised to avoid certain fish, such as swordfish, altogether.  Therefore, the current study looked at DHA supplements derived from algae. Ramakrishnan said there are no concerns about mercury contamination in DHA from algae.  More than 800 Mexican women were included in the study. Half were randomly selected to be in the treatment group while the other half received a daily placebo pill. The treatment group received 400 milligrams of DHA each day, beginning when they were between 18 and 22 weeks pregnant. Treatment continued at least until the birth of the baby.  Ramakrishnan said Mexican women tend to be deficient in DHA, much like many American women are.  The babies were assessed at 1, 3 and 6 months of age, and the mothers completed questionnaires about their babies' health. To aid their recall, the mothers were also asked to keep a diary, recording any illness symptoms.  Babies in the DHA group had a 24 percent drop in the odds of having a combination of cold symptoms at 1 month compared to babies whose mothers were given a placebo. Also at 1 month, babies whose mothers had gotten the DHA supplement had 26 percent shorter duration of cough, 15 percent less time with phlegm and 30 percent shorter duration of wheezing.  At 3 months, babies in the DHA group were also sick 14 percent less time. And, at 6 months, the babies whose mothers had DHA had shorter duration of fever, runny nose and breathing problems.  At times, however, babies in the DHA group experienced longer duration of rashes and vomiting, the study authors noted.  Ramakrishnan said that it's likely that DHA boosts infants' immune response.  Dr. Jennifer Wu, an obstetrician and gynecologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said, ""We've been recommending DHA intake in pregnant women for brain and nervous system development, and this study suggests another good reason to take DHA.""  Wu recommended that women who are thinking about becoming pregnant should ""start prenatal vitamins and DHA supplements about three months before pregnancy and then continue them throughout the pregnancy. If you're not taking them ahead of time, you may miss out on proper nutrition,"" she added.

"Like many breast cancer survivors, 34-year-old Lisa Elliot was prescribed tamoxifen, a hormone therapy drug used to prevent the disease from returning. But after a year on the anti-estrogen medication, she started experiencing menopause-like side effects.  “One of the symptoms that was the worst for me, that nobody ever mentioned, was the vaginal atrophy part of it,” Elliot told FoxNews.com. “That was really detrimental to my life, way more so than hot flashes were.”  Vaginal atrophy often occurs after menopause when a woman's estrogen levels decrease, which leads to a thinning of the vaginal wall. Some studies estimate it can affect up to 60 percent of postmenopausal women. Symptoms include vaginal dryness, irritation, itchiness, painful intercourse, and frequent urination.  Elliott’s symptoms started to impact her day-to-day life to the point where sitting in a chair felt extremely uncomfortable. Sex with her boyfriend also became terribly painful and even caused disputes in her relationship, she said.  “It was probably one of the reasons why that relationship didn't continue. To be in your late twenties, early thirties and say to your partner, ‘I'm sorry we can't ever have sex-- ever again, it’s just too painful,’ there's a lot of distrust that develops,"" Elliott said. “It was a question of, ‘Well are you not attracted to me? Is there somebody else?’ And that wasn't the case at all.”  Despite the dire conditions, only 20 to 25 percent of postmenopausal women seek treatment. Estrogen replacement therapy is commonly used to cure the condition, but it is not recommended for all patients. Since many breast cancers are fed by estrogen, these drugs are not safe for women like Elliott.  Doctors may also propose vaginal moisturizers and lubricants to help, but when these over-the-counter options were ineffective for Elliott, her doctors suggested the MonaLisa Touch, a laser treatment.  “This is a unique fractional carbon dioxide laser that's been utilized for many many years in the face, and in the neck to revitalize that skin,” Dr. Mickey Karram, the director of urogynecology at The Christ Hospital in Cincinnati Ohio, told FoxNews.com.  The therapeutic laser has been available in Italy for several years, but it was only recently approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).  “The skin becomes more lubricated; the actual skin surface thickens, becomes less sensitive, and becomes more pliable. It basically restores everything that you would see in that vaginal canal when the woman had normal circulating estrogen,” Karram, who authored the first U.S. clinical trial on the treatment, said.  During the procedure, the laser probe is inserted into the vagina and releases photon energy to the skin to stimulate the production of collagen.  “It initiates a process that starts to produce more cells that are important for that skin to be revitalized. And most of that is around collagen, and a material called glycogen, and these fibroblasts that get circulated,” Karram said. “Once the process gets going, within days usually a woman feels there's more lubrication.”  The laser technology is administered by a trained obstetrician or gynecologist, takes about five minutes, and does not require anesthesia. Women receive three laser sessions spaced six weeks apart and once yearly afterward.  Some experts do warn that further long-term efficacy and safety tests need to be done. To date, there has not been a placebo controlled trial or head-to-head trials with any other treatments, but those studies are in the process of being completed, Karram said.  Karram’s initial U.S. studies have shown some encouraging results with patients showing 85 to 90 percent improvement of all symptoms.  “In my 15 patients, 13 were basically cured and felt that all of their symptoms had resolved. Two of the patients had a few residual symptoms, but had significant improvement,” he said.  After a session, women may experience some spotting as a potential side effect and doctors do tell patients to avoid sexual intercourse for at least 24 to 72 hours after. The office-based procedure itself, however, is seemingly painless, Karram said.  “The insertion of the laser does hurt a little bit— it's like getting a pap smear,” Elliott said. “But the lasering itself doesn't. It feels just fine. And in fact, right afterwards you feel fine too, there's no residual pain.”  Elliott admitted she was skeptical of how effective the laser treatment would be, but after completing her three sessions she is more than happy she tried it.  “I feel amazing. I feel like I did before the atrophy, before the tamoxifen, before all of the bad stuff,” Elliott said. “Today I have a confidence that I didn't have for a very long time because I know that I can be sexually active with somebody that I care about and I don't have to worry about being broken.”  The MonaLisa Touch therapy can cost up to $3,000 and it is not covered by insurance.

The road to snuffing out cigarettes once and for all can be a long one.  “I think the big thing for people to remember is that it usually takes multiple attempts to be successful at quitting smoking,” says Dr. Valerie Bonne, a pulmonologist at Froedtert & the Medical College of Wisconsin in Milwaukee who oversees the health system’s smoking cessation program. “So just because you’ve tried in the past and haven’t been successful doesn’t mean you aren’t going to be successful in the future.”  In fact, research published last year in BMJ Open, an online, open access journal, found that for many smokers it may take 30 or more quit attempts before they finally kick the habit. Along with being persistent, experts like J. Lee Westmaas, strategic director of tobacco control research at the American Cancer Society, recommend trying lots of different approaches to smoke out the leading cause of preventable death. “I would say use as many aids as you can,” he says.  For those trying to quit, one new quit aid on the horizon will be easily accessed with an internet connection and a smartphone, tablet or computer: tailored emails.  Research led by Westmaas and published in May in the journal Tobacco Control looked at the effect of sending multiple emails to smokers during a quit attempt that were customized based on information provided by those individuals, such as quit date, their top two reasons for quitting, top five triggers for smoking and intended use of cessation medications. The findings showed that approach yielded quit rates that were higher than for those who received a single, non-tailored email containing links to smoking cessation resources. Self-reported rates of abstinence from smoking at six months after enrollment in the randomized controlled trial were 36 percent in the multiple email group compared with 26.5 percent in the single email group.  What’s more – though smokers are encouraged to try different methods of quitting – the research found the emails worked as a stand-alone approach. Westmaas says some emails were tailored based on whether study respondents planned to use nicotine replacement therapy, which has been found to be helpful for those seeking to quit smoking. Those study participants who weren’t planning to use NRT received an email explaining why use of NRT is actually a good thing, he says. Those receiving multiple emails who planned on using NRT got messaging outlining all the different kinds of NRT.  “Interestingly though, when we looked at whether or not people had used NRT, our results were the same. So even when we controlled for use of NRT, we still found an effect of the intervention,” he says – that is, receiving multiple, tailored emails helped people quit smoking regardless. “The intervention was effective whether or not you use nicotine replacement therapy.”  One of the study’s limitations was that those who participated were generally well-educated. The majority were white, and only 20 percent reported a high school education or less, suggesting the possibility that results may not necessarily be generalizable to less educated or other racial or ethnic groups, the researchers wrote. They suggest that future research should examine how well tailored emails worked for these and other groups, such as cancer survivors or lesbian, gay, bisexual, transsexual and intersex groups.  At present, the email program studied isn’t available to the general public. But Westmaas says the American Cancer Society aims to make a similar program available soon. “We hope that by the beginning of next year we’ll have something ready,” he says, adding that it could be earlier depending on the success of efforts to secure funding for the program.  In the meantime, those who wish to get support for quit attempts but prefer to receive it in a way that fits with an on-the-go lifestyle can opt to receive text messages to support a quit attempt as well – like through smokefree.gov, a website created by the Tobacco Control Research Branch of the National Cancer Institute. NCI also offers QuitPal, a free app for iPhone or iPad, for a quit assist. The app has numerous interactive features, such as tracking smoking habits with a calendar and providing tips to deal with cravings. It also allows users to connect with social media, where they can see loved ones' personalized video messages to support their progress.  The point, however support is provided, is to deliver it in a way that best suits the individual. “It seems like people have preferences for how they want to receive information, especially about quitting,” Westmaas says.  While some gravitate toward group smoking cessation classes, for example, others prefer to talk one-on-one with a counselor or on a smoking quitline, like 1-800-QUIT-NOW (also affiliated with NCI). Others prefer less intrapersonal interaction, and technology provides a way to reach more people trying to quit. Some people in rural areas may not have access to smoking cessation 	0

"CHICAGO – Millions of people who are struggling with the tough-to-use blood thinner warfarin, sold as Coumadin and other brands, may soon have another alternative.  An experimental Johnson & Johnson drug prevented strokes in people with a common heart rhythm problem as well as warfarin did and without an increase in bleeding or other side effects, a major study found.  But the fact it wasn't better than warfarin could make price a big factor in how widely it gets used if it wins federal approval and has to compete with a rival medicine that just came on the market.  ""These drugs are going to be very expensive, I'm sure, and that will play a role. Warfarin is dirt cheap,"" said Dr. Douglas Zipes, a heart rhythm specialist at Indiana University and past president of the American College of Cardiology.  He had no role in the new study, reported Monday at an American Heart Association conference in Chicago.  More than 2 million Americans have atrial fibrillation, when the heart quivers instead of beating normally. This raises the risk of blood clots that can cause a stroke.  For 60 years, the main treatment has been warfarin, but it's tough to use. Too little can lead to strokes; too much, dangerous bleeding. The right dose varies so much that people must get frequent blood tests to adjust it, and even foods like leafy green vegetables can throw it off.  The new drug is rivaroxaban (riv-ah-ROCKS-ah-ban), already sold outside the U.S. as Xarelto for preventing clots during hip and knee replacement operations.  The study tested it against warfarin in 14,264 people with atrial fibrillation in 45 countries. Half had already had a stroke and the rest were at higher risk of one because of heart failure, diabetes or other conditions.  After about two years' follow-up, 269 patients in the group given rivaroxaban had a stroke or blood clot versus 306 people on warfarin. But such a small difference in a study this large is a draw, statistically, so the drugs are considered comparable.  People on rivaroxaban were less likely to suffer serious bleeding in the brain. Rivaroxaban also didn't harm the liver — a problem that doomed an AstraZeneca blood thinner four years ago.  If approved, the drug would be sold by Johnson & Johnson's Ortho-McNeil division in the United States and elsewhere by Germany-based Bayer HealthCare AG. The federal Food and Drug Administration already is weighing whether to approve rivaroxaban for hip and knee surgery patients, and the companies plan to seek approval to sell it for the heart rhythm problem later this year.  In October, the FDA approved the first warfarin rival — Pradaxa, made by the German firm Boehringer Ingelheim. It costs about $7 a day wholesale compared to less than 50 cents for warfarin. But neither Pradaxa nor rivaroxaban interacts with food as warfarin does, or requires blood tests to adjust the dose. No price has been set for rivaroxaban, which is a daily pill versus twice a day for Pradaxa.  Which of the warfarin alternatives is better?  ""That's the inevitable question"" that only a new study comparing them in similar patients can answer, said Duke University's Dr. Kenneth Mahaffey, who led the rivaroxaban study.  Duke's Dr. Robert Califf, a study co-leader, said his 84-year-old mother, who has struggled with warfarin, likely would switch to one of the new drugs ""because she can afford it.""  They and other study leaders have consulted for or received research support from the makers of rivaroxaban and other heart drugs.  Dr. Elliott Antman, a Brigham and Women's Hospital cardiologist who is vice chairman of the heart conference, said patients already are asking about Pradaxa, and that any warfarin alternative will appeal to people ""who want a better quality of life, free of the burden of having to have frequent blood tests.""  ""Warfarin is the gold standard,"" and rivaroxaban seems an ""attractive option,"" he said.  ___  Online:  Heart rhythm problem: url  Heart Association: url"	0
The Mediterranean diet, supplemented with a handful of nuts or a few tablespoons of olive oil a day, can counteract the effects of aging on the brain’s ability to function, a new clinical study suggests.  The study, published online Monday in JAMA Internal Medicine, was unusual in that it employed rigorous scientific practices to test the effect of the diet on health. Most previous evidence showing benefits from the Mediterranean diet was gathered through observational studies, a less conclusive research technique.  “This was the first clinical, randomized study using a dietary pattern for good health,” said Emilio Ros, who led the study at Hospital Clinic, part of the University of Barcelona in Spain. Data gathered from previous observational studies suggested that adhering to a Mediterranean-type diet related to better cognitive function and a reduced risk of dementia, but observational studies have limitations, he said. “This clinical trial removes the bias and provides first-level evidence,” said Dr. Ros, director of the lipid clinic at Hospital Clinic’s endocrinology department.  The Mediterranean diet, which has also shown benefits in cardiovascular health, emphasizes vegetables and fruits, unrefined grains and beans. It also includes fish and wine and minimal consumption of meat and full-fat dairy products.  The study involved 447 cognitively healthy participants, 55 to 80 years of age, who were divided into three groups. Two groups followed the Mediterranean diet and added either 30 grams of mixed nuts (walnuts, hazelnuts and almonds) a day, or five tablespoons of extra virgin olive oil a day. The third group, acting as a control, was advised to follow a low-fat diet. The subjects were followed for a median of just over four years.  The results showed that, compared with the control group, memory function remained stronger in the Mediterranean diet plus nuts group, while frontal (attention and executive function) and global cognition benefited in the Mediterranean diet plus olive oil group.  The diminished decline in cognitive function likely stems from the abundance of antioxidants and anti-inflammatory agents found in the supplemental foods, Dr. Ros said. Olive oil and nuts are rich in phenolic compounds that might counteract oxidative processes in the brain, leading to neurodegeneration, the study said. “If you can delay your age-related cognitive decline, you can process tasks with higher speed,” said Dr. Ros.  Jane Cerhan, a clinical neuropsychologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., who wasn’t involved in the research, said clinical studies of age-related cognitive decline are needed in regard to diet, “which is why this study is an extra good one, because of its size and randomized design.” However, she said: “The changes observed in cognition were very small and didn’t actually show that those diets improved cognition, they just showed less decline.” Based on the research, she said, people shouldn’t rush out to buy lots of olive oil and nut, but she encourages they follow a balanced diet that includes healthy foods such as these.  The research was a substudy of a larger investigation, designed by Dr. Ros, that found the Mediterranean diet, supplemented with additional olive oil or nuts, reduced the incidence of major cardiovascular events among people at high cardiovascular risk. That study, which involved nearly 7,500 participants and known by the acronym Predimed, was published in 2013.  In the latest study, Dr. Ros said participants were given 1 liter of olive oil per week, but that amount was intended for their entire household. He recommends that, to decrease age-related cognitive delay, people should add 5 tablespoons of olive oil as well as a handful of nuts per day into their diet.  “I like walnuts, which are high in omega-3 fatty acids,” he said. In general, he would like to see everyone improve their diets “by eating more fish, less meat, and improving your legume intake.” He also suggested adding the Spanish “sofrito” sauce of slowly simmering tomatoes, onions, and garlic in olive oil to dress rice and pasta dishes in weekly menus. “We believe this is an antioxidant cocktail.”  The study was funded by the Spanish government. Dr. Ros has previously received research funding from the California Walnut Commission and is a nonpaid member of the group’s scientific advisory committee, the study said.	0
Researchers report some of the most encouraging results yet for treating lung cancer with the latest immune-based treatments, most of which have been approved to treat other types of tumors.  In three papers presented at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting, and published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine, lung cancer experts found innovative ways to weaken lung tumors to improve people’s chances of surviving the disease.  “There is definitely a high unmet need,” says Patrick Forde, assistant professor of oncology and associate member of the Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at Johns Hopkins, of the lack of effective treatments for lung cancer. Currently more than half of people who are treated even at early stages of the disease can expect the cancer to return, and chemotherapy typically leads to only a 5% improvement in people’s chances of living five years — but an up to 70% chance of being exposed to serious toxicities.  Health Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips. View Sample Sign Up Now  The studies involve a group of immune-based cancer drugs called checkpoint inhibitors, which are designed to rip away the molecular cloak behind which cancer cells hide from the immune system. The medications target a protein called PD-1, its related PD-L1, or CTLA-4, which protect the body’s cells from being killed by immune cells; because tumors are normal cells growing out of control, they take advantage of this molecular security blanket to avoid getting detected by immune cells. A series of checkpoint inhibitor drugs, first approved in 2011 initially for treating melanoma, expose the tumor cells to the immune system. Based on their success in treating skin cancers, scientists are now studying this group of drugs in a number of other cancers, including tumors in the lung.  In one study, called CheckMate-227, researchers tested whether a combination of two of these checkpoint inhibitor drugs could keep tumors from growing better than the standard treatment of chemotherapy in people with advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nearly 300 people were randomly assigned to receive either the combination of the immune-based drugs or the traditional chemotherapy treatment. After nearly a year, the lung cancer in people taking the immunotherapy was 42% less likely to have progressed than among people getting chemotherapy.  What’s more, say the study’s authors, doctors may also figure out which people are most likely to respond to the two-drug combination of nivolumab (Opdivo) and ipilimumab (Yervoy) and which are not. In the study, he and his colleagues found that people whose tumors had more mutations enjoyed the longest time period during which their cancers did not progress.  Currently, lung cancer treatments rely heavily on chemotherapy, but doctors are shifting toward a more customized and precise way of treating each person’s disease in order to improve their chances of survival. For example, newer targeted therapy drugs home in on specific genetic mutations that are responsible for driving a person’s cancer. Doctors can also determine if a person’s lung cancer is genetically vulnerable to the checkpoint inhibitor drugs tested in the current study. Putting together everything that doctors currently know about lung tumors, “more than half of people with lung cancer can avoid chemotherapy and get more precision-based treatments,” says Dr. Matthew Hellmann of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), lead author of the study. In addition, “a year after treatment, three times more people on immunotherapy were doing well compared to those who just got chemotherapy.”  The results could play a role in changing standard treatments for people diagnosed with advanced NSCLC, by making a strong case for starting people immediately on the immunotherapy combination rather than giving them chemotherapy first, as many doctors currently do. While nivolumab is approved for treating metastatic NSCLC, for example, that indication calls for using it if the disease continues to progress either during or after chemotherapy. This combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab showed that the paired drugs could be more effective when begun as the first treatment, instead of chemotherapy.  Get The Brief.

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Gentle yoga classes may help people with type 2 diabetes take off a small amount of weight and steady their blood sugar control, a small study suggests.  People perform yoga during a gathering calling for world peace, at Ibirapuera Park in Sao Paulo August 21, 2011. REUTERS/Nacho Doce  The study, of 123 middle-aged and older adults, found that those who added yoga classes to standard diabetes care shed a handful of pounds over three months. Meanwhile, their average blood sugar levels held steady — in contrast to the non-yoga-practicing “control” group, whose blood sugar levels rose.  The findings, reported in the journal Diabetes Care, do not suggest that yoga should replace other forms of exercise for people with type 2 diabetes — a disease commonly associated with obesity.  To really lose weight and rein in blood sugar, more-vigorous exercise would work better, according to Shreelaxmi V. Hegde of the Srinivas Institute of Medical Science and Research Center in Mangalore, India.  Among the 60 study participants who took yoga classes several times a week, the average BMI — a measure of weight in relation to height — declined from 25.9 to 25.4. A BMI between 25 and 30 is considered overweight.  “In our study the effect of yoga on BMI (body mass index) and blood sugar control was marginal,” Hegde, the lead researcher on the work, told Reuters Health in an email.  “But,” she added, “it should be noted that yoga controlled the blood sugar levels which otherwise rose in the control group.”  In addition to that, the study found, signs of so-called oxidative stress declined in the yoga group.  Oxidative stress refers to a situation where levels of reactive oxygen species or “free radicals” — damaging byproducts of energy use in cells — rise beyond the body’s capacity to neutralize them. Long-term oxidative stress is believed to contribute to a host of chronic diseases.  In this study, Hegde’s team measured participants’ blood levels of certain chemicals that reflect oxidative stress. They found that, on average, the yoga group’s levels of the chemicals dipped by 20 percent.  The significance of that is not clear. Hegde said that if such a decline in oxidative stress were sustained over time, it might lower the chances of diabetes complications, which include heart and kidney disease, nerve damage and damage to the blood vessels of the eyes.  Further, long-term studies are needed to see whether that is the case, the researchers say.  According to Hegde, yoga may curb oxidative stress because it stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system — the part of the nervous system that basically acts as a brake against the gas pedal of the sympathetic nervous system.  There are caveats. The yoga used in this study was a gentle form, Hegde said, and parts of the practice were adapted for people who had additional health problems; certain poses were avoided in people who had heart disease, for example.  In the real world, yoga classes vary widely. Some are vigorous work-outs involving complicated poses that would not be appropriate for older adults with chronic health conditions.  Older adults with diabetes can look for yoga classes designed specifically for older people and those with chronic medical conditions. In the U.S., hospitals and local community centers are increasingly offering such classes.  SOURCE: bit.ly/qJGXZ4 Diabetes Care, online August 11, 2011.	1
"Two blood-building drugs injected soon after birth may give tiny preemies a lasting long-term edge, boosting brain development and IQ by age 4, a first-of-its-kind study found.  The study was small but the implications are big if larger, longer studies prove the drugs help even the playing field for these at-risk children, the researchers and other experts say.  Babies who got the medicine scored much better by age 4 on measures of intelligence, language and memory than preemies who didn't get it. The medicine group's scores on an important behavior measure were just as good as a control group of 4-year-olds born on time at a normal weight.  The results are ""super exciting,"" said Dr. Robin Ohls, the lead author and a pediatrics professor at the University of New Mexico. She said it's the first evidence of long-term benefits of the drugs when compared to no blood-boosting treatment.  Even though the treated youngsters didn't do as well as the normal-weight group on most measures, their scores were impressive and suggest greater brain development than the other preemies, Ohls said.  They scored about 12 points higher on average on IQ tests than the untreated kids but about 10 points lower than the normal-weight group. On tests measuring memory and impulsive behavior, the treated kids fared as well as those born at normal weight.  Here's how those differences would show up in a preschool setting: The untreated group would be the kids who struggle a little in class, while the those who got the medicines would do OK but not as well as those born at a normal weight, said Dr. Michael Schreiber, a prematurity expert at the University of Chicago's Comer Children's Hospital.  Survival of extremely tiny preemies has improved dramatically in the past 50 years, but treatment for medical problems and developmental delays linked with prematurity has not kept pace, Schreiber said. He was not involved in the study.  He said larger studies including more diverse patient populations are needed to determine if the drugs can help a broader range of preemies.  The study involved 53 children, most white or Hispanic, born more than a month premature and weighing less than 3 pounds at hospitals in New Mexico, Utah and Colorado. Two dozen normal-weight children were also included.  Results were published Monday in Pediatrics.  Shortly after birth the preemies were randomly assigned to receive injections of either erythropoeitin (EPO), three times weekly; darbepoetin once a week for several weeks; or no treatment. The drugs build red blood cells and are approved to treat anemia caused by cancer treatment or resulting from other conditions.  Preemies lack the ability to make new red blood cells and often need frequent blood transfusions to replace blood taken for lab tests. The drugs are now sometimes used to try to reduce their need for transfusions, in doses similar to the ones studied.  The drugs can increase endurance by boosting oxygen levels in the blood, and have been implicated in some sports doping scandals.  Dr. Sandra Juul, a University of Washington pediatrics professor, is leading a larger multi-center study of both drugs in preemies and said it's too soon to recommend the medicines for treating developmental delays.  Still, since almost half of infants born extremely early have significant developmental problems, any treatment that could improve their lives ""is incredibly important,"" Juul said.  ———  Pediatrics: url  Prematurity: url  ———  Follow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner at url .

"En Español  By Amanda Gardner  HealthDay Reporter  MONDAY, Oct. 25, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- One of the world's most ubiquitous and pedestrian drugs -- aspirin -- may cut the risk of dying for men who have prostate cancer that has not yet spread beyond the gland, a new study suggests.  In looking at the records of more than 5,000 men with prostate cancer, 2,000 of whom were taking aspirin or another blood-thinning drug, researchers presenting at the annual meeting of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) in San Diego report that the risk of dying from the cancer was reduced by more than half.  ""We show that patients taking anticoagulant [blood thinning] medication had better outcomes with regards to prostate cancer death and that this benefit was most prominent in patients who had high-risk disease,"" said study lead author Dr. Kevin Choe, a radiation oncologist with the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas. High-risk tumors are more aggressive and thus more likely to eventually kill the patient.  Choe spoke at a Monday ASTRO teleconference.  Of the blood thinners used in the study, aspirin was the one which seemed to account for most of the benefit, the researchers said  There has already been some evidence that cancer and the body's coagulation system might be linked in some way.  ""Cancer patients tend to develop clots in their legs and lungs more frequently and also patients who develop clots in their legs and lungs tend to develop cancer more frequently,"" Choe noted. ""We hypothesized that anticoagulant medication may lower the chance of death from prostate cancer in men who have localized prostate cancer.""  And, at least according to this retrospective review of medical records, this did indeed appear to be the case. Retrospective studies -- where researchers look back over previously collected data, looking for associations -- are not as reliable as prospective trials, however.  The study included 5,275 men diagnosed with prostate cancer that had not yet spread beyond the prostate gland and had been treated with surgery or radiation. Of the almost 2,000 patients on anticoagulants in the study, 1,649 were taking aspirin, 428 warfarin, 287 clopidogrel (Plavix), 26 enoxaparin, and 408 a combination of blood thinners.  After an average follow-up of about seven years, only 1 percent of men who had been taking an anticoagulant had died versus 4 percent of those in the control group. At 10 years, 4 percent of those taking one of these medications had died versus 10 percent in no-blood thinner group.  This translates to a risk reduction of about 50 percent, the researchers calculated.  The chances of the cancer spreading to the bone were reduced while PSA (prostate-specific antigen) blood levels -- thought to be a marker for cancer's advance -- were also better controlled.  ""This benefit was seen whether these patients were treated with surgery or radiotherapy,"" Choe added.  Cancer cells are coated by platelets when they enter the bloodstream and are on their way to spreading. This protects them from immune cells and also helps them stick to their next location, Choe explained. Anticoagulants may work by interfering with this process.  But Choe said he is not ready to recommend routine aspirin use in men diagnosed with prostate cancer.  ""It's premature to say that aspirin should be used in a standard-therapy way in all patients with prostate cancer,"" he said. ""But we may expect to see this benefit in those who are taking aspirin for other [usually cardiovascular] reasons.""  Aspirin also comes with some risks of its own, including stomach bleeding, Choe pointed out.  A second study, conducted in the United States, Canada and Great Britain and also being presented at ASTRO, suggests that a combination of hormone therapy plus radiation may be the best treatment for men who have locally advanced prostate cancer with a high risk of returning.  This usurps the previous view that hormone therapy was useless or even ""unkind or toxic,"" said study lead author Dr. Malcolm Mason, a radiation oncologist with Cardiff University in Wales.  This trial, the largest of its kind, involved about 1,200 men who were randomly chosen to receive hormone therapy alone or a combination of that and radiation.  An initial review at six years suggested that those taking the combination therapy had a 43 percent reduced risk of dying from prostate cancer, while side effects were not ""major,"" Mason said. ""If the figures from the interim analysis are similar to the final analysis, we would expect a 43 percent reduction in the chances of death from prostate cancer in men with this regimen,"" he said.  ""We feel these results are practice changing,"" Mason added. ""The standard treatment for localized, high-risk prostate cancer for people who are fit for radiotherapy should be a combination of hormone therapy plus radiotherapy.""  Experts note that studies presented at scientific meetings do not face the same peer-re"	0
The GeneSight test result helped prompt Brown’s psychiatrist to switch him to a new drug in June, making Brown, 40, optimistic that there might be a path back to a job, an apartment, and even a new girlfriend. But three weeks later he was suicidal, checking into a mental hospital at his therapist’s urging.  By collecting the former editor’s DNA with a quick cheek swab, a new genetic test retailing at $3,800 would reveal which depression medications Brown would likely respond well to and those he would not.  RUTLAND, Vt. — For the first time in John R. Brown’s two-decade quest for the right medication to make his brain behave, his psychiatrist offered him hope in the form of what seemed like rock-solid science.  Advertisement  “I can’t help but wonder if I should have stuck with the devil I know,’’ Brown now says.  Genetic tests to identify the most effective psychiatric drugs are the hot new technology in the race to create personalized treatments based on people’s DNA. More than 600,000 of these tests have likely been administered in the last three years, based on company websites and research data, to better treat conditions ranging from depression to attention deficit disorder to anxiety. In a nod to the tests’ growing acceptance, the federal Medicare program last year agreed for the first time to pay for the GeneSight test for some depressed patients.  But a review by the New England Center for Investigative Reporting has found that virtually all the evidence that these psychiatric tests work is based on limited studies funded by the companies themselves or researchers they fund, including all five studies used to promote GeneSight on the company’s website.  The federal government doesn’t require companies to prove that this and thousands of other tests are accurate before marketing and selling them. Unlike drugs, the Food and Drug Administration does not regulate them, though that may soon change.  Advertisement  Some of the testing firms’ research practices also raise questions about potential conflicts of interest. For example, California-based Proove Biosciences provides a full-time employee to administer and run a study on the company’s test at a Littleton, Mass., mental health clinic. It pays clinicians for time spent related to the study, a relationship that could give clinicians an incentive to steer patients to the test — and give the company access to insurance reimbursement for those patients.  Patients also cannot find out for themselves if their doctor stands to gain financially by recommending a personalized medicine test. A public federal database created in 2014 to disclose financial relationships between the health care industry and physicians excludes most genetic tests.  “It is the Wild West,’’ said Mildred Cho, associate director at the Stanford Center for Biomedical Ethics, who says there is little published evidence on the effectiveness of drug response tests.  Eric Lander, a leader of the Human Genome Project and founding director of the Broad Institute in Cambridge, goes further, saying in a New England Journal of Medicine article earlier this year that the mental health testing company claims are “not harmless and may be quite dangerous.”  In psychiatry, a field hampered by a lack of definitive tests for conditions and treatments alike, the idea of a genetic test to identify the drugs most likely to be effective is particularly appealing as a way to cut down on the trial-and-error approach to medications that many patients face.  Advertisement  And the tests do hold promise. The basic science behind them is built on years of solid research — analyzing an individual’s genetic make-up to determine how they may respond to drugs. GeneSight’s test was developed using technology from the respected Mayo Clinic and Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center.  Officials at Assurex Health, the Ohio-based company that makes GeneSight, stand behind their product. They make no guarantee that GeneSight will lead doctors to pick the right medicine for patients, but they point to company studies that show it more than doubles the odds they will. Plus, the officials note, the test underwent close review by a Medicare contractor before the agency agreed to pay for the tests.  “Patients do better,’’ said Bryan M. Dechairo, senior vice president of medical affairs and clinical development for Assurex. “We continue to do more studies” to show the test’s value.  The amount of money at stake is enormous. Psychiatric conditions affect 1 in 4 adults every year and 1 in 5 teens, according to the National Alliance on Mental Illness. Finding a test to more precisely target treatment could help troubled people find help more quickly, cut down on side effects, and save money. It can also make hundreds of millions of dollars for the test makers, which helps explain why at least 15 companies are now ramping up mental health testing.  “It is so much more than just getting the medications right,’’ said Rachel	0
Robison, 58, is autistic. At age 40, the Amherst resident was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome, a developmental disorder marked by impaired social skills and difficulty with nonverbal communication. Although highly competent in fields like electronics, sound design, and car mechanics, Robison found his limited ability to read body language and other unspoken cues left him feeling cut off from normal human interaction.  For the first time in many years, John Elder Robison entered a sixth-floor lab at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and settled into a chair. He was there to demonstrate — although not actually repeat — a procedure known as transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, in which electromagnetic impulses are fired into carefully targeted areas of a patient’s brain. TMS activates neurological pathways and is most commonly used to treat depression.  Advertisement  Beginning in 2008, Robison voluntarily underwent roughly a dozen TMS sessions as part of a research study conducted at BIDMC’s Berenson-Allen Center for Noninvasive Brain Stimulation. The results are chronicled in Robison’s new book, “Switched On: A Memoir of Brain Change and Emotional Awakening.”  In a moving, often harrowing narrative reminiscent of “Awakenings” and other popular works by the late neurologist and writer Oliver Sacks, Robison writes of the transformations these sessions helped unlock, the welcome ones — and the not so welcome.  After his initial TMS session, Robison experienced music on a visceral level he had once known, long ago, but sensed he had lost. He burst into tears. “The experience was richer and deeper, with an added layer of feeling,” he writes. “Perhaps I was hearing music pure and true, without the distorting lens of autism.”  Other striking changes in perception and mood soon followed. Some proved transitory, others seemingly more permanent.  “The change in my ability to relate to people is really, really big,” he said during an interview in a hospital conference room.  Advertisement  His book is likely to spark even greater interest — and funding — in TMS as a non-medicinal way to treat symptoms associated with disabilities like autism, epilepsy, ADHD, and dementia. Robison certainly hopes so.  “My world is strikingly different, even if the TMS energy is all dissipated,” he said. He maintains his ability to read body language and communicate his own feelings through facial expression have improved dramatically.  “I feel I hear music with more clarity, too. Whether I think it’s there, or it really is there, it’s all the same,” added Robison, a physically large man who smiles easily and often. To a reporter who first met him a decade ago, the changes in his demeanor are obvious: more relaxed, less guarded, more emotionally engaged.  Robison also happens to be a gifted writer — his 2007 memoir “Look Me in the Eye: My Life With Asperger’s” was a critically acclaimed bestseller. He’s also a prolific blogger with a knack for dredging wry humor out of awkward situations.  Still, for all the positive changes described in “Switched On,” Robison’s fourth book, there were negatives he was forced to deal with. TMS treatments chipped away at what he calls his “protective shield” of autism, he writes, leaving him disoriented and depressed at times.  His second marriage, to a woman who herself suffered from chronic depression, came undone within a year of his initial TMS sessions. He frequently fell behind schedule at work (Robison runs a high-end car repair business in Springfield and lives in Amherst). Old friendships fell apart. As Robison’s public profile rose — since “Look Me in the Eye,” he has divided his time between the car business and advocating on behalf of autism awareness — it disrupted his life on many levels.  Advertisement  Robison, with research fellow Ali Jannati. Keith Bedford/Globe Staff  At his lowest point, in 2009, Robison considered killing himself. Gaining and then losing abilities he’d never possessed caused “a mixture of sadness and wonder,” Robison writes, summing up his condition in one word: “jarred.”  Robison has previously written about growing up in Western Massachusetts in an intellectually prominent family (his father taught philosophy, his mother wrote poetry) plagued by alcoholism and mental illness. Much of that dysfunction was also chronicled in “Running With Scissors,” the 2002 best-selling memoir by Robison’s brother, Augusten Burroughs.  “Switched On” revisits that dark and stormy past. Yet it is more than a linear account of a life transformed by cutting-edge medical technology.  A “techno geek” with a deep knowledge of mechanical and electrical systems — he once worked as a sound engineer and special-effects designer for the rock band KISS — Robison delves into the latest brain-research findings and TMS’s potential to help others like himself. He celebrates neurodiversity more generally, too, a subject he has been teaching at William & Mary College and Harvard Medical Sch	0
NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - U.S. researchers say they have found clear signs that blood clots in the lungs are being overdiagnosed, exposing patients to potentially dangerous side effects from unnecessary drugs.  Using national data, the researchers found the rate of so-called pulmonary embolisms, or PEs, nearly doubled with the introduction of a new powerful diagnostic test more than a decade ago.  Yet there was only a slight drop in deaths from the condition over the same period, suggesting many of the clots were too small to cause harm.  “Rather than an epidemic of disease, we think the increased incidence of PE reflects an epidemic of diagnostic testing that has created overdiagnosis,” the researchers write in the Archives of Internal Medicine.  It’s been estimated that more than 600,000 Americans have a pulmonary embolism each year. The condition usually occurs when a blood clot travels from the legs to the lungs, sometimes with fatal results.  But with increasingly sophisticated tools, doctors may be spotting clots that would never have been fatal in the first place.  One such tool is called a CT chest scan, which produces detailed images with high-dose x-rays and is being used in millions of patients every year in the U.S.  In the years before 1998, when the technique was introduced, 62 per 100,000 Americans were diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism annually. After 1998, that number rose to 112 per 100,000.  The number of deaths caused by the condition dropped only little, however: from 12.3 per 100,000 in 1998 to 11.9 per 100,000 in 2006.  “This is consistent with overdiagnosis of pulmonary embolisms that may have caused very little harm, may not have caused death,” said Dr. Renda Soylemez Wiener of Boston University, who worked on the study.  On the other hand, the blood-thinning drugs used to treat blood clots increase the risk of bleeding in the brain or gastrointestinal tract, for example.  According to the new results, such complications rose from three to five per 100,000 people hospitalized with PE per year after doctors began using chest CT scans.  The new findings add to other evidence showing that medical testing is on the rise across the U.S., although in many cases the impact on overall health remains unclear.  CT scans expose patients to radiation, for example, which can increase the likelihood of developing cancer. And the dyes used to enhance the scan also cause kidney damage in a significant portion of people.  “I think doctors should think carefully about the pretest probability of a pulmonary embolism before they order this test,” Wiener told Reuters Health.  Yet there is no easy solution at this point, because untreated blood clots can be fatal, she added.  “Right now, it is a difficult place for the patient to be in,” Wiener said.

There’s growing evidence that concussions may have more lasting effects than previously thought, and that monitoring people with head injuries, no matter how apparently minor, is crucial to ensuring they receive proper treatment and minimize the effects of the trauma.  Health Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips. View Sample Sign Up Now  But there aren’t good ways to distinguish between mild blows that don’t require additional care and mild to moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI), which could have more serious consequences. Currently, CT scans of the brain are the standard way of diagnosing TBI, but they can’t pick up every case. And because the expose patients to radiation, doctors are often reluctant to use them on every patient, especially young children, who come to the emergency room with a head injury.  MORE: NFL’s Concussion Research Full of Holes, Report Finds  But in a study published in JAMA Neurology, scientists report on a promising blood test that could distinguish the more serious cases of TBI that require further evaluation. Led by Dr. Linda Papa, director of clinical research and an emergency physician at Orlando Regional Medical Center, the research team focused on two blood proteins that have already been linked to brain injury. Papa and her team expanded on that work by studying how levels of these two proteins, or biomarkers, change immediately after head trauma.  They collected blood from 584 people coming to the Orlando Regional Medical Center, which is a Level 1 Trauma Center, for trauma-related injuries. About half them had brain-related injuries, and half had other traumas, including broken bones and chest injuries. Papa wanted to test several things about the blood test, including whether they were specific to brain injuries or whether they changed during any trauma to any part of the body. All of the people had their blood drawn 19 times, starting at within four hours of their injury and up to 7 days later. By tracking changes in the levels of the two proteins over this time, Papa could see how they changed, and correlate that with the people’s symptoms.  MORE: Concussion Expert: Over 90% of NFL Players Have Brain Disease  In all people, regardless of the type of injury they had, the levels of the proteins, called GFAP and UCH-L1, rose within the first hour after the injuries. GFAP, which is specific to cells known as astrocytes that form a matrix for nerves in the central nervous system (which includes the brain and spinal cord), peak at 20 hours after the injury and then decline steadily but are still detectable seven days later. UCH-L1 is released by brain nerves when they’re stressed, and its levels rise more rapidly immediately after injury and peak at eight hours.  Get The Brief.

CHICAGO (Reuters) - Lightly shocking a person’s brain just before they learned a new task appeared to strengthen memory in a handful of patients with epilepsy, a tantalizing result that could have implications for Alzheimer’s disease, U.S. researchers said on Wednesday.  Pacemaker devices known as deep brain stimulators made by Medtronic and St. Jude Medical are already used to calm muscle tremors in patients with Parkinson’s disease and other movement disorders, and are being tested for a host of other conditions such as treatment-resistant depression.  The devices are implanted under the skin in the chest with wires leading up the neck connected to tiny electrodes implanted deep in the brain, which produce electrical impulses.  The current study was done at the University of California at Los Angeles in seven epileptic patients awaiting surgery who had electrodes implanted deep in their brains to help pinpoint the source of their seizures. The team used this opportunity to see how stimulating the brain affects memory.  They focused on an area of the brain called the entorhinal cortex, which helps form and store memories.  “The entorhinal cortex is the golden gate to the brain’s memory mainframe,” Dr. Itzhak Fried, professor of neurosurgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, who worked on the study, said in a telephone interview. The research was published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  Fried said sensory experiences that eventually become memories pass through this hub before they are stored in the hippocampus, the brain’s chief memory center.  For the study, patients played a video game in which they had to shuttle people around in taxis to different shops in a virtual city. The team tested whether stimulating the entorhinal cortex or the hippocampus while they were learning their way around the city improved their recall.  “When we stimulated the hippocampus itself, there was not an effect. It was really stimulation in the gateway to the hippocampus - the entorhinal cortex - where we got the beneficial effect in terms of memory,” Fried said.  Compared to testing before stimulation, zapping this part of the brain helped people recognize landmarks and navigate the virtual city more quickly. Fried said the findings suggest stimulating the brain just as memories are forming is key.  IMPACT ON ALZHEIMER’S  In Alzheimer’s disease, this area of the brain is affected early on, when signs of dementia begin to appear.  Fried said the study might have implications for treatments for patients with early Alzheimer’s disease, but he cautioned that the results are very preliminary.  “The question would be whether this can help memory in patients with memory impairments,” he said. Scientists are increasingly focused on ways to treat the memory-robbing disease, which affects more than 5 million Americans.  Despite costly efforts, no drug has been found that can keep Alzheimer’s from progressing, and policymakers are growing increasingly worried about the swelling ranks of dementia patients as the population ages.  Suzanne Haber, a neuroscientist at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York who was not involved in the study, said she was “very excited about the finding,” but she cautioned that the treatment is very invasive, very expensive and unproven in Alzheimer’s patients.  The Obama administration said on Wednesday it plans to spend an additional $156 million over the next two years to help find an effective treatment for Alzheimer’s.  One team has already tried deep brain stimulation in Alzheimer’s patients. In a study published in the Annals of Neurology in 2010 researchers tested deep brain stimulation in six patients over the course of a year and found the treatment to be relatively safe. They also saw signs the treatment might have an effect on memory.  Dr. Sandra Black, a brain researcher at the University of Toronto who wrote an editorial on the current study, said the findings could have implications for early stage Alzheimer’s disease if tests were developed to identify this process early through imaging or genomics.  “Although the current evidence is preliminary, is based on small samples and requires replication, the potential application of deep-brain stimulation in amnestic disorders is enticing,” Black wrote.	0
"Many women with early breast cancer do not appear to need removal of their lymph nodes, as is often recommended, according to a federally funded study released Tuesday.  The study, involving nearly 900 women who were treated at 115 sites across the country, found that those who did have their lymph nodes removed were no more likely to survive five years after the surgery than those who did not, the researchers reported in a paper published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.  Breast cancer is diagnosed in about 200,000 women each year in the United States, with the cancer reaching the lymph nodes in about one-third of the cases.  When the cancer has spread to any lymph nodes, doctors usually recommend that nodes in the armpit be removed surgically, along with the tumor in the breast, to reduce the risk of a recurrence. But such removal is painful, makes recovery more difficult and leaves women susceptible to complications, including infections and a chronic, sometimes disabling swelling in their arms known as lymphodema.  In the new study, Armando Giuliano of the John Wayne Cancer Institute at Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., and colleagues analyzed data collected from 445 women who had their nodes removed and 446 who did not, along with radiation and chemotherapy. They found no significant difference in the patients' chances of surviving five years after their diagnosis. The five-year ""disease-free"" survival rate was 83.9 percent in those who did not have the more aggressive surgery compared with 82.2 in those who did, the researchers reported.  Based on the findings, the researchers said, women who fit the criteria of those in the study probably do not need to undergo the additional surgery. The researchers noted that the study was limited to women with tumors known as T1 or T2, meaning they were relatively small, had no enlarged nodes that could be felt, and the cancer had not spread elsewhere.  In an accompanying editorial, Grant Walter Carlson and William Wood of Emory University in Atlanta called the study an ""important contribution"" that represents the latest development in breast cancer treatment, which has steadily been moving toward less-aggressive options, sparing women from unnecessary surgery and follow-up therapy. The study provides ""strong evidence"" that many women can safely forgo lymph node removal, they wrote.  In a telephone interview, Gary Lyman of the American Society of Clinical Oncology said the findings will probably prompt the group to revise its recommendations for breast cancer patients accordingly. The panel that issues those guidelines is currently reviewing its recommendations, he said.  ""I think this will be practice-changing,"" he said.  About 60 to 70 percent of women with cancer diagnosed in lymph nodes may now opt not to have more nodes removed based on this study, meaning thousands of women would avoid the additional surgery, he said.  ""This is good news. It's a substantial number of women,"" Lyman said."	0
A Wisconsin woman traveled hundreds of miles to MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington for a delicate operation: replacing under-arm lymph nodes lost in cancer surgery. A small but growing number of hospitals offer the procedure. See photos.  WASHINGTON (AP) — Breast cancer treatment left Susan Wolfe-Tank with an arm too painfully swollen to lift anything heavy or even fit into her usual clothing — a debilitating condition that gets little attention and has no cure.  Desperate, the Wisconsin woman traveled hundreds of miles to seek a delicate operation — replacing under-arm lymph nodes lost in cancer surgery — as a small but growing number of hospitals offer microsurgical attempts at relief from lymphedema that help some patients but not all.  “Right in this area, feel that — that is your lymph node,” Dr. David Song of MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington told Wolfe-Tank during a recent check-up.  Song, Georgetown’s plastic surgery chief, had removed healthy lymph nodes from Wolfe-Tank’s back and side and implanted them in the affected arm. As the new nodes took root, her arm was shrinking. A delighted Song’s only caution: “Take care of them,” by wearing a compression sleeve as prescribed.  “This isn’t a cure. I will still have to be careful,” said Wolfe-Tank, 51, of Hurley, Wisconsin. But, “I will be able to cross-country ski again, just live a normal life. Look at my arm, it’s incredible.”  Lymphedema is a chronic swelling, often in an arm or leg, that in severe cases can be disfiguring, impair mobility, cause disabling pain, harden the skin and lead to infection.  Lymph nodes work like biological pumps in a network that’s part of the immune system. They drain watery fluid called lymph that, traveling through tiny channels, brings nutrients to cells and takes away bacteria and waste material. Lose or damage enough lymph nodes or channels in a particular area and that fluid builds up.  There’s no good count, but millions of Americans are estimated to have some degree of lymphedema, and while it can be hereditary or result from injury, many U.S. cases are a lasting side effect of treatment for a variety of cancers.  Consider breast cancer. While better surgical techniques in recent decades have lowered the risk, experts estimate that still about 6 percent of breast cancer survivors who undergo a “sentinel node biopsy” — removing a few nodes to check for spreading cancer — will develop lymphedema. That risk jumps to about 20 percent for women like Wolfe-Tank who need additional lymph nodes removed because of more advanced cancer. Radiation causes further harm.  Yet too often women aren’t warned about symptoms or checked for early signs, when lymphedema is more easily treated, said Dr. Sheldon Feldman of New York’s Montefiore Einstein Center for Cancer Care. He co-authored physician guidelines issued this fall by the American Society of Breast Surgeons on prevention and treatment of breast cancer-related lymphedema.  Typical patients have “had that swelling for a while,” Feldman said. “Now the treatment is an uphill battle.”  The main treatment consists of wearing compression bandages and massage to bring down swelling. A lymphedema specialist initially prescribed a large pump that massaged Wolfe-Tank’s arm for an hour a night, temporarily relieving some of the pain.  “But if I used my arm, I was back to square one,” Wolfe-Tank said. “I didn’t fit into my coat anymore. I live in the snow capital of Wisconsin. I’m not supposed to shovel. We’ve got to fix this.”  Wolfe-Tank had struggled for four years when an oncologist recommended lymph node transfer. The rationale: There are more lymph nodes in the body’s trunk than in the limbs — more avenues to drain off fluid — and thus it should be safe to move a few. Hunting for a surgeon, Wolfe-Tank found Song, who transferred about five nodes along with supportive blood vessels and other tissue, hoping they’d grow new channels to drain fluid.  It’s not the only option. A technique called lymphovenous bypass reroutes lymph-carrying channels, going around damaged or missing nodes to drain into veins instead.  Some surgeons use a variation of that technique protectively, in hopes of preventing lymphedema from forming in the first place. During the initial cancer surgery, they check which lymph-carrying channels the node removal left dangling — and connect them to blood vessels to drain.  “Surgical options offer great potential,” note the breast surgeons’ new guidelines. But they don’t work for everyone.  About a third of lymph node transfer patients see some positive effect, Song said.  And Feldman noted that over about the past decade, the microsurgeries have been studied only in small research trials, and results vary with surgeon experience. One debate is whether to offer lymph node transfer early, before patients build up as much damage as Wolfe-Tank did. Insurance coverage also varies.  Feldman’s bottom line: Patients considering micros	0
After 12 weeks of daily yoga and coherent breathing, the subjects’ depressive symptoms significantly decreased and their levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid, a brain chemical that has calming and anti-anxiety effects, had increased. The research was presented in May at the International Congress on Integrative Medicine and Health in Las Vegas. While the study was small and lacked a control group, Dr. Streeter and her colleagues are planning a randomized controlled trial to further test the intervention.  “The findings were exciting,” she said. “They show that a behavioral intervention can have effects of similar magnitude as an antidepressant.”  Controlled breathing may also affect the immune system. Researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina divided a group of 20 healthy adults into two groups. One group was instructed to do two sets of 10-minute breathing exercises, while the other group was told to read a text of their choice for 20 minutes. The subjects’ saliva was tested at various intervals during the exercise. The researchers found that the breathing exercise group’s saliva had significantly lower levels of three cytokines that are associated with inflammation and stress. The findings were published in the journal BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine in August.  Here are three basic breathing exercises to try on your own.  Coherent Breathing  If you have the time to learn only one technique, this is the one to try. In coherent breathing, the goal is to breathe at a rate of five breaths per minute, which generally translates into inhaling and exhaling to the count of six. If you have never practiced breathing exercises before, you may have to work up to this practice slowly, starting with inhaling and exhaling to the count of three and working your way up to six.	1
Oct. 8, 2012 -- Men who eat lots of tomatoes and tomato-based products may have a lower risk for stroke, a new study suggests.  Tomatoes are rich in the antioxidant lycopene.  Men who had the highest levels of lycopene in their blood were 55% less likely to have a stroke, compared with men who had the lowest levels of the antioxidant in their blood.  The lowered risk was even greater for strokes caused by blood clots in the brain, called ischemic strokes. These are the most common type of stroke. Men who had the highest lycopene levels were 59% less likely to have this kind of stroke than men with the lowest levels. The findings appear in the Oct. 9, 2012, issue of Neurology.  The new study included slightly more than 1,000 men from Finland aged 46 to 65. Researchers measured the level of lycopene in their blood when the study began and followed the men for about 12 years. During that time, 67 men had a stroke.  “This study adds to the evidence that a diet high in fruits and vegetables is associated with a lower risk of stroke,” says researcher Jouni Karppi, PhD, of the University of Eastern Finland in Kuopio. “The results support the recommendation that people get more than five servings of fruits and vegetables a day, which would likely lead to a major reduction in the number of strokes worldwide, according to previous research.”  Other studies have shown that high lycopene levels may be linked to a reduced risk of certain cancers. Cooked tomatoes tend to have a greater effect on blood levels of lycopene than raw tomatoes or tomato juice. Tomatoes are not the only food that is rich in this antioxidant. Other sources include pink grapefruit, watermelon, and guava.	0
"March 4, 2010 -- A new urine test may reduce unnecessary biopsies for prostate cancer.  The test, which is approved in some European countries but not in the U.S., detects genetic material -- RNA -- from prostate cancer gene 3 or PCA3.  At a news briefing held in advance of the 2010 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium, researchers presented results of the largest study to date of the PCA3 test. It showed that the test accurately predicts whether a prostate biopsy will reveal cancer in high-risk men.  PCA3 is found only in the prostate. When prostate cells become cancerous, their PCA3 genes go crazy. Prostate cancer cells express up to 100 times more PCA3 RNA than do normal cells.  The PCA3 test can do things the PSA test can't, says Jack Groskopf, PhD, of Gen-Probe Inc., which manufactures the test and funded the new research.  The PSA test detects prostate-specific antigen, a protein given off by all prostate cells. If a man has any type of damage to the prostate, his PSA level can go up. ""More often than not, the damage is due to benign (noncancerous) conditions such as enlarged prostate"" -- a condition called benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH, Groskopf tells WebMD.  This often triggers unnecessary biopsies and, sometimes, unnecessary surgery.  The PCA3 test isn’t a replacement for PSA testing. But it improves the ability to diagnose prostate cancer, Groskopf says."	1
NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A therapy that allows hay fever sufferers to get allergy shots in the form of a tablet or drops can help alleviate symptoms and cut people’s reliance on allergy medication, a new research review confirms.  Known as sublingual immunotherapy, the treatment relies on the same principles as traditional allergy shots, but is delivered by tablets or drops that dissolve under the tongue.  Allergy shots may be used for hay fever when antihistamines and other allergy medications do not control a person’s symptoms adequately, or for people who want to reduce their reliance on medication.  The shots help prevent hay fever symptoms by exposing people, over time, to small amounts of the pollen to which they are allergic, essentially desensitizing the immune system to the allergen.  Allergy shots are typically given weekly at first, followed by monthly injections over several years. The treatment does not cure hay fever but is generally effective at reducing symptoms. However, inconvenience and discomfort limits patients’ willingness to try allergy shots.  Sublingual immunotherapy is an alternative and has become commonly used in Europe, where two tablet-based products against grass-pollen allergies are available: Grazax and Oralair. There are also a number of drop-based products. No sublingual immunotherapy products have yet been approved in the United States, however.  For the new study, reported in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, Italian researchers combined the results of 19 clinical trials conducted since 1995 on the effectiveness of immunotherapy tablets and drops against hay fever caused by grass pollen.  The trials lasted anywhere from three months to three years.  Across the studies, which included a total of 2,971 adults and children with grass-pollen allergies, immunotherapy reduced symptoms by about 20 percent to 30 percent, on average. It also allowed patients to reduce their use of antihistamines and other medications.  The researchers, led by Dr. Gabriele Di Lorenzo of the University of Palermo, describe the benefits as “modest.”  In an email, Di Lorenzo told Reuters Health that the findings suggest that sublingual immunotherapy is “highly effective in many, but not in all patients.” He said that more work is needed to identify which patients might be most likely to benefit.  Dr. Harold Nelson, an allergist at National Jewish Health in Denver, said that the body of evidence indicates that sublingual immunotherapy beats antihistamines and other medications used to control hay fever symptoms.  In an interview, he noted that antihistamines reduce symptoms by about 12 percent to 15 percent, on average. Nasal steroids, another hay fever option, appear to cut symptoms by about 17 percent.  On the other hand, Nelson said, allergy shots appear to outperform the oral versions, with a symptom reduction about twice that of sublingual immunotherapy.  In addition, the long-term effectiveness of the grass-pollen tablets is not yet fully clear.  Like allergy shots, the oral immunotherapy takes time. Grazax, for instance, is taken daily, starting several months before the start of the next grass-pollen allergy season and continuing for three years thereafter.  Research so far suggests that the symptom relief persists in the year after patients stop taking Grazax. A study published earlier this year — and not included in the current analysis — found that during that post-treatment year, Grazax patients had one-quarter fewer hay fever symptoms than those who had been given a placebo for comparison.  But longer term data are not yet available. The benefits of allergy shots, by contrast, have been shown to persist for 10 years or beyond, Nelson noted.  The ultimate cost-effectiveness of sublingual immunotherapy has also yet to be determined; in the UK, for example, Grazax treatment costs about 2.25 pounds ($3.50) per day. In theory, that could pay off if long-term use of allergy medications was cut, but that has yet to be shown.  Still, Nelson said that if sublingual products do win approval in the U.S., they will likely boost the number of hay fever sufferers who want to use under-the-tongue immunotherapy. Even though the effectiveness is less than that of allergy shots, the convenience of an at-home version of immunotherapy is a plus, and the sublingual therapy tends to have fewer side effects than shots, according to Nelson.  The most common side effects include itchiness and irritation in the mouth, ears and eyes, swelling of the mouth or tongue, headache and gastrointestinal problems like stomach pain and heartburn.

Carbohydrates sound so innocent: mere starches, sugar and fiber that the body uses for energy. Yet health-conscious Americans despise them, designing entire diets just to cut them out.  But out of the pile of cast-off carbs, there are some you should keep. New research around a certain kind of carb, called “resistant starch,” suggests that they could be a key way to help control weight.  When we eat refined carbohydrates, like white bread and cookies, our bodies absorb them very quickly, and the hormone insulin ushers them into our cells. Eat a lot of them, and the body will store most of those calories instead of burning them—which is why we gain weight on high-carb diets.  But that’s not the case with resistant starches, so named because they resist digestion. These kinds of carbs bypass the small intestine (where most food is digested) and head to the large intestine (also known as the colon) to be metabolized. There, they’re fermented and turned into short-chain fatty acids, which the body burns as energy. Resistant starches also serve as powerful prebiotics—food for intestinal bacteria in the colon.  Health Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips. View Sample Sign Up Now  Those benefits—getting digested slower, being converted into fatty acids and sustaining colonies of gut bacteria—set resistant starch apart. Resistant starch is being explored as a healthy food for people with type-2 diabetes; eating it improved certain measures of inflammation, a condition that often precedes type-2 diabetes, and lipid profiles in women with the condition, showed one 2015 study.  “Certain populations and cultures have been benefiting from resistant starches for a long time,” says Paul Arciero, professor in the health and exercise sciences department of Skidmore College. “In my belief, that’s what’s protected them against some of the ravages of the more modern-day high carbohydrate diet.”  Luckily, resistant starch is found in a range of delicious foods. Legumes, beans, whole grains and some seeds have it, as do uncooked potatoes and unripe bananas. Products made from these foods, including bean flour, potato starch, tapioca starch and brown rice flour, also count.  Getty Images; Illustration by Marisa Gertz for TIME  Most intriguing and surprising of all is that so many leftovers contain resistant starch. When you cook a certain starchy food, like white rice, pasta or a potato, and then cool it in the refrigerator, the food develops resistant starches. “Cooking the carbohydrate starch alters the chemical bonds in the food,” Arciero explains. Stick it in the fridge, and as the food cools, those bonds reform in a new design. “The ensuing structure of those bonds during the cooling process is what makes them resistant to then being digested in the small intestine,” Arciero says. Even if you heat them up again, they retain their new resistant starches.  In all of its forms, resistant starch shows promise for helping people control their weight. In a Nutrition Journal study published in October 2015, Arciero and his team cooked a series of four pancake breakfasts for 70 women. The four pancakes were made from ordinary starch, starch plus whey protein, resistant starch (a tapioca-based starch modified to become resistant—much like leftovers are), and resistant starch with whey protein.

"Drug Fulfills Promise Of Research Into Cystic Fibrosis Gene  toggle caption Jeffrey Sauger  The promise of genetic medicine is beginning to be fulfilled, but it's been a long, hard slog.  Take the story of Kalydeco. It's designed to treat people with a lung disease called cystic fibrosis. While not quite a cure, the drug is extremely effective for some CF patients.  But the success of Kalydeco has been more than two decades in the making.  A good starting point for the story is Aug. 24, 1989. That's the day scientists from the U.S. and Canada announced the discovery of the gene associated with the disease. It was the early days of gene hunting, and the CF gene was a big prize.  CF is the most common genetic disease in Caucasians. When people inherit a damaged form of the CF gene, a critical protein inside cells doesn't work properly. As a result, sticky mucus builds up in a patient's lungs, causing infections and making it hard to breathe.  The announcement was supposed to be made in conjunction with three papers in the Sept. 8 issue of Science, but a reporter for Reuters got hold of the story early. Science took the unusual step of allowing the scientists to speak to the media before publication.  At the time, scientists predicted that a genetic test for CF was just around the corner. But they also thought a drug to treat the disease was in reach.  The first prediction turned out to be right. ""But it wasn't until 20 years later that we were able to find drugs that directly target the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis,"" says Fred Van Goor, who led the team at what is now Vertex Pharmaceuticals that developed Kalydeco. ""So it was a long time between the discovery of the gene and the discovery of Kalyedco.""  toggle caption Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.  It took awhile to find a drug that would help restore the function of the protein the CF gene makes. ""We tested over 600,000 chemicals in cells with the defective protein that causes cystic fibrosis,"" says Van Goor.  One of those chemicals ultimately became a successful drug, but it had to be modified so patients could take it by mouth, and so it would last the right length of time in a patient's body.  From the start, Van Goor and his colleagues knew there was a problem with Kalydeco: It only works on a small subset of people with CF. They have to have a particular mutation in the CF gene, or the drug is of little use.  But for people who do have that mutation, the drug works remarkably well.  Emily Schaller was in one of the early studies of Kalydeco. As part of the study, researchers first gave her a placebo, then switched her to the active drug. She knew within days that something was different.  ""I was with my brother in Florida, and we were walking down the street, and I took a deep breath, and when I took a deep breath in and I let it out, I didn't cough,"" says Schaller. ""But not only did I not cough, but I felt that my lungs were clear, and that something huge had happened. It was just something I had never felt in my life before.""  Schaller isn't cured. She still has a damaged CF gene. The only way to fix that would be gene therapy, where a healthy form of the gene would supplant the damaged one. Although it seems simple in theory, in practice gene therapy has been incredibly difficult to accomplish.  Schaller isn't particularly bothered by that. ""Everyone talks about curing a disease — cure CF, cure these other diseases. [But] Kalydeco controls CF at the basic defect, so I'm OK with the other 'c' word, control, because I'm living it and I've never felt better in my life.""  The time from gene discovery to successful drug may be shortening, but there are only a handful of successful drugs so far, and for a while at least, the appearance of new ones will be slow.  They're also likely to be expensive. Kalydeco costs in the neighborhood of $300,000 per year."	0
When Sierra Riddle stormed into the conference room at Denver’s child protective services office, the director of the agency was seated there, along with her son’s team of doctors, top administrators from the Children’s Hospital Colorado oncology department and lawyers. She recalls looking one of the physicians in the eye, defiant. “I’m done with this shit,” she remembers saying. “I’m done with you guys bullying us.”  Then, she took out a bag and dumped the contents on the table: nine months of cancer drugs prescribed to her son, Landon, who was 4 at the time. He had been diagnosed more than a year before with an aggressive form of leukemia and undergone months of grueling treatment. But his mother was now refusing to follow his doctors’ orders. “Listen: Here’s all this chemo you told CPS he cannot live without, and if I didn’t give it to him, he would relapse and die.”  Tech & Science Emails and Alerts - Get the best of Newsweek Tech & Science delivered to your inbox  But Landon, who underwent only one year of cancer treatment instead of the recommended four, was still alive—thriving, in fact—even though he’d stopped taking that massive pile of drugs prescribed for him. That’s why his mother had called this meeting. She implored the CPS director—whom by then she knew by first name—to restrain the oncologists who had threatened to take her child away and put him in foster care. Riddle believes the doctors wanted to prove she was a neglectful, abusive mother, but she knew she could convince the world that the hospital was wrong about her son’s treatment. (Due to HIPAA patient privacy laws, Children’s Hospital Colorado was unable to comment on Landon’s case for this story.)  Landon’s cancer, diagnosed in September 2012, had put Riddle in a situation that’s any parent’s worst nightmare: She had to watch him undergo lifesaving treatment that appeared to be killing him. Riddle says she was left with no choice but to defy his doctors’ orders.  RELATED: What we know about how cancer starts could all be wrong  In January 2013, nearly four months after Landon’s initial diagnosis, the two went from Utah to Colorado, where Riddle purchased an alternative treatment fraught with complicated politics and plenty of skepticism—especially when it comes to saving the life of a preschooler with a potentially fatal disease. At the time, Colorado was one of only about a dozen states in the U.S. that had legalized medical cannabis. It also allowed sick children to access the drug under professional guidance. Landon became the youngest patient in the U.S. at that time to receive a medical marijuana card. Riddle’s decision to treat her child with cannabis landed the family in the center of a contentious national debate, as well as on prime-time television with CNN’s chief medical correspondent, Sanjay Gupta. In Utah, all cannabis is illegal, so when their story went public, she and Landon had to move permanently to Colorado, so he could continue to have access to the drug. Even now, at 7, he still needs to take cannabis to cope with the long-term effects of chemotherapy and radiation, she says.  By the time of that showdown with CPS and Landon’s doctors in Denver, Riddle had stopped giving her son all of the drugs prescribed by the hospital: the chemo, opiates and benzos. The latter two—which included OxyContin, morphine and Ativan—were prescribed to help Landon cope with the side effects of cancer treatment. None of them helped, she says, or they made him feel worse. But when Landon started the cannabis oil, his health miraculously improved. She was willing to do whatever it took to keep him on cannabis.  A Key in the Lock  As laws that permit medical cannabis have expanded nationwide (29 states in the country now permit some form of cannabis use for medical purposes), cancer patients increasingly use the drug to alleviate the harsh symptoms of chemotherapy, such as nausea, anxiety, loss of appetite and insomnia. But there’s also an emerging body of research that suggests marijuana might be effective as a treatment for cancer on its own, or in conjunction with standard therapies.  When Riddle made the decision to give her son cannabis, the information on its safety and efficacy was (and still is) limited to anecdotal accounts, a handful of case reports and lab studies published in obscure medical journals. Initially, her hope was that the drug would lessen the side effects. But Riddle soon heard that certain compounds in cannabis—cannabinoids—have been shown to induce cancer cell death. The theory seemed to be especially promising for leukemia, at least according to studies done on cancer cells in test tubes and on mice injected with human leukemia cells. But at that point there wasn’t any evidence it would work for humans. There still isn’t. While cannabis is legal in many U.S. states, the drug is still classified by the Drug Enforcement Administration as a Schedule 1 narcotic (along with heroin and cocaine), which make it very 	0
"Oct. 10, 2011 -- A small study shows that a new drug being tested for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease reduces the buildup of plaques in the brain associated with the fatal disease.  The experimental compound, known as gantenerumab, is being developed by Roche, the Swiss pharmaceutical company.  ""The results and especially the rapidity of the effects observed in the gantenerumab trial went beyond our expectations,"" Luca Santarelli, MD, study co-author and Roche senior vice president of neuroscience, writes in an email.  The study is published in the online edition of Archives of Neurology.  Santarelli describes gantenerumab as a drug engineered to bind itself to plaques known as amyloid-betas, which accumulate as Alzheimer's progresses. In the study, patients who received monthly gantenerumab injections showed reductions in such brain plaques.  What is not entirely known at this point, though, is if these plaques cause Alzheimer's or are by-products of the disease. Therefore, it's not known if reducing the amount of them will slow or stop the disease."	0
"En Español  By Kathleen Doheny  HealthDay Reporter  TUESDAY, Dec. 6 (HealthDay News)-- Women who get routine mammograms can lower their risk of dying from breast cancer by nearly half, a new Dutch study suggests.  ""Our study adds further to the evidence that mammography screening unambiguously reduces breast cancer mortality,"" said Dr. Suzie Otto, a senior researcher in the department of public health at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.  The routine screening also lowered the chances of being diagnosed with an advanced cancer, she said.  The study appears online Dec. 6 in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention.  Mammography screening, including the best schedule and the best age to begin, is being hotly debated in the United States and elsewhere. Some experts think women should start getting them at age 40. Other think women should discuss the pros and cons of the test at 40, decide on an individual basis and start screens routinely at 50. Otto's study only looked at women aged 49 and older.  Otto tracked 755 patients who died from breast cancer from 1995 to 2003 and another 3,739 control patients matched by age and other measures.  Among the women with breast cancer, nearly 30 percent of tumors were found at screening and about 34 percent between screens. Nearly 36 percent of these women had never had a mammogram.  Advanced tumors were found in about 30 percent of the patients who had never been screened but in just over 5 percent of those who had mammograms.  Women who underwent screening reduced their risk of dying from breast cancer by 49 percent. Women aged 70 to 75 had the greatest risk reduction, reducing the risk of dying from breast cancer by 84 percent. The risk reduction in younger women, aged 50 to 69, was smaller, at 39 percent, but still considered substantial.  The greater risk reduction in women aged 70 to 75, Otto said, is probably a result of the long-term good effects of screening participation in the earlier target age group, 50 to 69, before the upper age limit for screening was extended in the Netherlands from 69 to 75.  The study findings ''add to the body of evidence supporting the fact that mammography matters in improving detection and survival,"" said Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""This study focuses on survival.""  The study, however, has some limitations, Bernik noted. It's not clear, for instance, whether the women who died of cancer got less aggressive treatment or refused treatment. That could have affected survival, of course.  Mammography does lead to ''overtreatment"" in some cases, Bernik acknowledged. Some cancers that are found on mammography may not have proven to be an issue in a woman's lifetime. ""But there is no way to figure out which cancers will be a problem or not,"" she said.  More information  To learn more about mammograms, visit the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services."	1
"By Alan Mozes  HealthDay Reporter  MONDAY, Aug. 15, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- A traditional Chinese herbal treatment may reduce fever from H1N1 (""swine flu"") influenza just as well as the prescription medication Tamiflu, a new study suggests.  ""For thousands of years, Chinese herbs have been used to treat influenza,"" study co-authors Dr. Chen Wang and Dr. Bin Cao, of Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, in China, said in an email. ""The pandemic influenza 2009 gave us the opportunity to evaluate a standard Chinese herb formula"" designed to target the flu, they added.  Cao and Wang, who specialize in infectious diseases and clinical microbiology, said the herbal recipe -- known as maxingshigan-yinqiaosan (M-Y) -- is easily accessible throughout China and much less expensive than Tamiflu (oseltamivir).  However, finding the medicine in the United States is difficult, if not impossible, given that it contains the stimulant ephedra. The United States has banned or restricted the sale of ephedra products because of concerns about possible complications, such as heart attack, stroke and even death, related to its use as a weight-loss supplement.  The authors discuss their findings in the Aug. 16 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.  The 2009 H1N1 (""swine flu"") pandemic sparked influenza cases around the globe, resulting in nearly 18,000 deaths, the authors said.  Per World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, in most instances, Tamiflu was the treatment of choice, where it was available. However, it is often out of reach in less developed parts of the world, such as rural China, where traditional herbal medicines are a likely default treatment.  The M-Y flu preparation is composed of 12 herbs: ephedrae, zhimu, qinghao, shigao, yinhua, huangqin, chaoxingren, lianqiao, bohe, zhebeimu, niubangzi and gancao.  To compare the relative effectiveness of M-Y and Tamiflu in treating H1N1 influenza, the authors focused on 410 previously healthy patients who were diagnosed with a ""very mild"" form of the illness.  The men and women were relatively young, with an average age of 19. They were being treated in 11 different medical facilities across four Chinese provinces during the height of the pandemic, between July and November of 2009, to prevent spreading the flu, not because their symptoms were severe.  Within 72 hours of the onset of symptoms, the patients were assigned to one of four five-day treatment groups. One group was given 75 milligrams of Tamiflu twice a day in capsule form; a second group received 200 milliliters of M-Y four times a day in liquid form; a third group took the same dosages of Tamiflu and M-Y together; and a fourth group received no treatment.  All of the herbs were screened for quality, and the M-Y mixture was deemed to meet Chinese safety standards.  The results: Both M-Y and Tamiflu were effective at eliminating fever, whether administered on their own or in combination.  All three approaches helped to resolve fever sooner than no intervention whatsoever, the authors said, noting it appeared that fever dissipated fastest when M-Y and Tamiflu were given together. However, none of the treatment methods appeared to be superior in terms of overall viral control, and side effects were minimal in all cases.  Even though the ephedra-containing herbal is not readily available in the United States, the M-Y herbal formula is available in many countries besides China, including Korea, Japan, India and Germany, the study authors noted.  Duffy MacKay, vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs at the Council for Responsible Nutrition, which represents the dietary supplement industry, believes that fears over ephedra's use as a weight-control agent have overlooked ""its more traditional and much safer"" role as a medicine against lung inflammation.  MacKay said that in China, traditional medicine is ""seamlessly integrated"" into everyday medical practice.  ""Here in the U.S., we do things differently,"" he said. ""We have our prescription drugs on the one hand, and then we have dietary supplements on the other.""  But, MacKay continued, ""it should also be understood that these two treatments actually work very differently. Tamiflu works to stop viral replication. But the herbal formula is working on symptoms to help people become more comfortable. And those are two very different goals,"" he noted.  ""So our advice,"" MacKay added, ""is that because H1N1 can be very serious, it's very important to see your doctor. And once you're under the care of your licensed physician there's certainly a lot of things in the world of botanicals that might help.""

What would happen if screening for male infertility was just about as easy as taking a pregnancy test in your home bathroom?  That’s the question researchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital tried to answer when they went about developing a smartphone-based test that men could use to test their semen in the comfort of their homes.  The test delivered impressive results, identifying abnormal semen samples with approximately 98 percent accuracy according to the researchers, who published their findings Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine.  Infertility affects up to 12 percent of the male population worldwide. Though it’s as common as female infertility, it often goes unrecognized due to factors like cultural stigma, the high cost and time required for testing, and access to laboratory facilities.  As things stand now, men have to provide samples “in these specific rooms in hospitals under so much stress and embarrassment,” the study’s principal investigator, Hadi Shafiee, PhD, told CBS News.  His team’s new approach aims to change that with a simple and inexpensive at-home test option.  The smartphone-based test involves several distinct parts: one, a disposable device on which to place the sample, including a disposable microchip that handles the sample; two, an optical attachment that connects to a smartphone; three, an app that guides the user through each step of testing. The researchers say the optical attachment could be created by 3D-printing, and the device would only cost about $5.  The testing kit also includes a tiny weight scale that connects wirelessly to the testing app and measures the total number of sperm swimming in the sample.  The March 22, 2017 cover of the journal Science Translational Medicine depicts a smartphone-based test for male infertility. Gilank Bara Verdana / Ravastra Design Studio, Science Translational Medicine  The researchers tested the device on 350 clinical semen specimens in Massachusetts, including both trained and untrained users in their trial.  “The accuracy of this approach was very similar to that of computer-assisted laboratory analysis, even when it was performed by untrained users with no clinical background,” they wrote in the study.  The app is similar to a fitness tracker, in a sense, in that it stores any history of previous semen samples as well. The app’s user experience is hard to forget: users can see vivid moving images of their sperm right on the screen.  Though the system is in the prototyping stage, it could eventually shake up the world of fertility testing by allowing men to evaluate their sperm in their own homes and helping health centers with fewer resources offer easy, cheap testing.  In addition, the developers say it could also potentially be used by men who have had a vasectomy to monitor their progress at home following surgery. Currently, they’re required to make office visits to a urologist for several months to ensure that the operation was successful.  Shafiee’s team plans to continue refining the test and then file for approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Several other home-based tests are already on the market, but Boston researchers say their version can analyze additional aspects of the sample, checking how well the sperm move (known as motility) as well as their concentration.  Male infertility has a range of root causes, from low or abnormal sperm production to blockages to illness.	1
"Chicago (CNN) -- For the first time, patients with the deadliest form of skin cancer have two new treatment options that prolong survival, according to new research presented at a cancer conference in Chicago on Sunday.  One drug specifically targets a mutated gene that tells a cancer cell to grow, the other boosts a patient's immune system in the fight against the disease. Both drugs cause tumors to shrink and prolong survival for patients with melanoma that has spread to other parts of the body, but neither is a cure.  ""This is an unprecedented time of clinical options -- it is truly practice-changing,"" said Dr. Lynn Schuchter, who heads the Melanoma Center at the University of Pennsylvania and is not involved with the research.  MayoClinic: Find out more about melanoma  One study presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's (ASCO) conference on Sunday focused on the experimental drug vemurafenib. About half of all melanoma patients have a mutated BRAF gene. This mutation tells the cell to continue to grow.  ""It's like the on-switch is stuck,"" said Dr. Paul Chapman, from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Center in New York and lead author of the study. Vemurafenib blocks the mutated gene, which kills the cancer cell and shrinks tumors.  Researchers compared this new drug, which comes in pill form, to the only FDA-approved chemotherapy drug for melanoma, dacarbazine: It has been used to treat melanoma patients since 1975, but is only effective in about 10% of patients.  Nearly 90% benefited from this new targeted drug, Schuchter said.  In a large, phase 3 study involving 675 people worldwide, patients on vemurafenib did much better than those on chemotherapy. Forty-eight percent of patients on vemurafenib had substantial tumor shrinkage that lasted for more than a month, compared to 5.5% of patients in the chemotherapy group.  Those taking vemurafenib had a 63% reduced risk of death compared to those on chemo. Patients on vemurafenib saw the drug work within 72 hours and 84% of the patients were still alive after six months, compared with 64% of patients getting dacarbazine.  ""These are truly striking results"" ASCO president Dr. George Sledge said.  Patient advocates like Tim Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation, are thrilled because ""the incidence of melanoma is going up all over the world and the treatment landscape has been terrible.""  Drugs that treat breast cancer found to prevent it, too  Sledge and other cancer experts are confident that based on these study results, vemurafenib will almost certainly will get FDA approval this year.  A second study showed that the recently approved drug Ipilimumab, sold under the name Yervoy, also extends survival for melanoma patients with advanced disease.  It doesn't target a specific part of the cell. Instead, it stimulates the patient's immune system to allow it to better fight the cancer. Patients with and without the BRAF mutation were eligible to participate.  Among 502 patients enrolled in this clinical trial, half were given Yervoy plus dacarbazine and the other half were given a placebo and chemotherapy.  ""Twenty-one percent of (the Yervoy) population was alive after three years,"" lead study author Dr. Jedd Wolchok said, compared to 12% who got the placebo and chemo. Wolchok, also an oncologist from the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, said patients taking Yervoy saw the drug work for them for 19 months, compared to only eight months in patients in the chemo group.  Schuchter says melanoma patients are celebrating this moment because there are now two good treatment options for patients, when there really were none before.  ""I've been doing this for 25 years, and we've not had drugs that extended survival. That is what is so remarkable here,"" Schuchter said.  While patients taking vemurafenib do very well, Schuchter said the drug stops working after about nine or 10 months. But in many cases that are nine or 10 months they otherwise would not have had.  Yervoy takes a while to work, and some patients may not have that time, study author Chapman said. He also points out that both drugs do have side effects so patients have to be monitored.  Doctors and researchers will now explore how to best use these drugs -- give one before the other, or simultaneously.  Wolchok says manufacturers of both drugs (Genentech's vemurafenib and Bristol-Myers Squibb's Yervoy), which also funded these studies, have agreed to work with researchers to study how these drugs are tolerated by patients when taken together, giving doctors even more possible treatment options. This is very unusual in the world of drug development, he said.  According to the American Cancer Society, melanoma is one of the most common cancers in young adults today. More than 68,000 people were diagnosed with melanoma last year and about 8,700 died.  Not all melanomas can be prevented, but limiting exposure to strong sunlight and other sources of UV light like tan"	0
It is the first new drug for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 22 years to become available in the United States. Called edaravone – brand name Radicava – its FDA approval this week was met with a wave of excitement from the media and the ALS community.  But some physicians are raising concerns over the cost of the drug and whether or not patients will be able to get it, as well as noting misconceptions about how effective at fighting this degenerative condition this drug will actually be.  Each year, doctors diagnose anywhere between 5,000 to 6,000 Americans with this rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease, and the Centers for Disease Control estimates that 12,000 to 15,000 people at any given time in the U.S. live with the disease. The majority of these patients die within two to five years of diagnosis.  The FDA approval is based on a study of 137 people with ALS published earlier this year. Patients received either a placebo pill or edaravone over a six-month period. Researchers found that those getting edaravone had a 33 percent reduction in their rate of decline in physical function.  It’s a finding that inspires hope of slowing -- but not yet stopping or reversing -- the progression of this disease.  Dr. Leo McCluskey, who leads the University of Pennsylvania’s ALS Center and was not involved in the study nor in the approval of this drug, said the findings are promising but he added that he fears they could be misinterpreted.  “Thirty percent is pretty robust,” McCluskey said. But he nonetheless added, “We have patients calling our center asking for the cure to ALS, and this is not a cure.”  And then there is the price tag. According to MT Pharma America, the company behind Radicava, the cost is around $1,000 per infusion – and treatment, which involves multiple infusions, may total about $146,000 per year.  “This is just for the drug; you also need a nurse and infusion equipment,” McCluskey said. “We don’t know who is going to cover it or what criteria will be used to decide who gets it.”  McCluskey also expressed concerns about the feasibility of ALS patients with reduced mobility going to receive daily infusions. “Imagine you’re a patient with difficulty moving around, and you now have to come in every day to receive infusions.”  And the number of infusions needed means many such trips. Edaravone is administered by an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes in 28-day cycles. The initial cycle involves a daily infusion for two weeks, followed by a two-week period without infusions. Additional cycles consist of infusions for 10 days over two weeks followed by two-week drug-free periods.  In an interview with ABC News, Tom Larson, the chief commercial officer for MT Pharma America, said the company is already taking steps to streamline the process for obtaining Radicava. The company has set up a system called Searchlight, through which patients and physicians can apply for the drug, obtain benefits information, identify an infusion center and schedule an infusion. Larson said the company has partnered with over 1,100 infusion centers across the country in an effort to “make this as easy and accessible to patients as possible.”  As for the costs and coverage of the drug, Larson said insurance companies are still deciding whether they will pay for Radicava. “We are in the process every new pharmaceutical goes through as payers make a decision.”  Edith Bracho-Sanchez, M.D., is a pediatrics resident at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.	0
"En Español  SUNDAY, Feb. 26, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental drug improves patients' blood sugar control without increasing the risk of low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) in patients with type 2 diabetes, according to the results of a phase 2 clinical trial.  Type 2 diabetes is the more prevalent form of the disease, accounting for about 90 percent of cases. Often tied to obesity, type 2 diabetes involves a gradual decline in how insulin responds to changes in blood sugar (glucose).  The new drug, called TAK-875, is a pill designed to enhance the secretion of insulin in response to such changes, which means that it has no effect on insulin secretion when blood sugar levels are normal -- potentially reducing the risk for hypoglycemia.  The trial, led by Dr. Charles Burant of the University of Michigan Medical School, included 426 patients with type 2 diabetes who were not getting adequate blood sugar control through diet, exercise or treatment with the first-line diabetes drug metformin.  The patients were randomly assigned to receive either TAK-875 (303 patients), placebo (61 patients), or another diabetes drug called glimepiride (brand named Amaryl).  The study was funded by Takeda Pharmaceutical (which is developing the drug), and appears online Feb. 26 in The Lancet.  After 12 weeks, all the patients taking the different doses of TAK-875 had significant drops in their blood sugar levels, the researchers said. A similar reduction occurred in patients taking glimepiride.  However, the incidence of episodes of hypoglycemia was much lower among patients taking TAK-875 (2 percent) than among those taking glimepiride (19 percent) and the same as those taking the placebo (2 percent).  The incidence of treatment-related side effects was 49 percent among patients taking TAK-875, 48 percent among those in the placebo group, and 61 percent among those in the glimepiride group, according to the researchers. They write that they are ""excited about the potential of TAK-875 and are eager to conduct larger trials to find out how well this drug works, how safe it is and what its place is in the treatment of diabetes.""  In a journal commentary, Clifford Bailey of Aston University in Birmingham, England, cautioned that, ""on the journey to approval of a new class of treatment for type 2 diabetes, many questions will be asked of [drugs such as TAK-875],"" including questions of how long they might remain effective, as well as safety issues.  Other diabetes experts had mixed views on the new findings.  Dr. Loren Wissner Greene is clinical associate professor of endocrinology at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City. She noted that glitazones -- a separate class of newer drugs such as Rezulin, Avandia and Actos that also target insulin resistance -- have all shown initial promise in clinical trials before worrisome side effects began to surface in users (due to concerns around heart risks, Avandia remains on the U.S. market but under limited distribution).  As for TAK-875, it targets a separate mechanism ""but again, until more is known about short-term and long-term cardiovascular effects, we need to proceed with moderated enthusiasm for each new drug and drug mechanism,"" Wissner Greene said.  Dr. Minisha Sood, endocrinologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City stressed that, ""given the rising global incidence of type 2 diabetes, the medical community is eagerly awaiting the development of novel agents to add to our existing armamentarium of anti-diabetic agents.""  She said that, ""though this study includes a small sample size followed for a short period of time, the results are promising in that TAK-875 appears to be effective for glycemic [blood sugar] control without significant risk for hypoglycemia or weight gain. However, like Wissner-Greene, Sood said that ""further investigation is warranted, especially including [heart disease] patients.""

"Nov. 22, 2010 -- Eat your veggies and you may live longer, a study suggests.  The study shows that eating foods rich in antioxidants, like vegetables and fruits, fights disease and may prolong life.  Researchers found that people with the highest levels of the antioxidant alpha-carotene in their blood had a 39% lower risk of death from any cause, including heart disease and cancer, than those who had the lowest levels of the antioxidant during the 14-year study.  ""These findings support increasing fruit and vegetable consumption as a means of preventing premature death,"" write researcher Chaoyang Li, MD, PhD, of the CDC and colleagues in the Archives of Internal Medicine.  Alpha-carotene is part of a group of antioxidants known as carotenoids, which also includes beta-carotene and lycopene. Vegetables particularly high in alpha-carotene include yellow-orange vegetables, such as carrots, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, and winter squash, and dark green vegetables, such as broccoli, green beans, green peas, spinach, turnip greens, collards, and lettuce.  Although previous studies have suggested eating more fruits and vegetables is associated with a lower risk of disease, studies have not shown that taking beta-carotene supplements reduces the risk of dying from heart disease or cancer.  Researchers wanted to see if other carotenoids may also play a role in reducing the risk of disease."	1
News flash: Eggs are really good for you. This message was brought to you by the American Egg Board.  That’s right – the folks who sell eggs paid for a study that comes to the shocking conclusion that eggs are an ideal breakfast food. They could have just asked people if they liked eating eggs for breakfast.  Instead, they recruited 20 volunteers who were overweight or obese and assigned them to a week of either egg breakfasts or ready-to-eat cereal breakfasts. After a two-week gap, the groups were switched. Both types of breakfasts had the same number of calories, but the egg breakfasts contained “higher protein quality,” according to an abstract for the study, posted online here.  The folks who carried out this egg industry-funded research were from the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, La. This place conducts some serious research on diet and weight. So to assess whether people who ate egg breakfasts were better off than their counterparts who ate cereal, they took blood samples and measured the concentration of two key hunger hormones: acylated ghrelin (which stimulates hunger) and PYY3-36 (which is how the intestines let the brain know that you’re full). Sure enough, in the week when they ate eggs, volunteers had lower acylated ghrelin and higher PYY3-36 compared with the week when they ate cereal.  Advertisement  The researchers also treated the volunteers to four buffet lunches. They weren’t just being nice – researchers kept track of how much food everyone ate. They found that volunteers ate smaller lunches after they ate egg breakfasts compared with when they ate cereal breakfasts. The reason: They were less hungry.  The study was presented Saturday at the European Congress on Obesity in France by Nikhil Dhurandhar, a biochemist who studies obesity at Pennington. According to his website, Dhurandhar’s research usually focuses on viruses and other infectious agents that can cause obesity.  Return to the Booster Shots blog.	1
"Cempra Inc moved a step closer to approval of its lead antibiotic, solithromycin, after an oral version of the potential blockbuster met the main goal in a late-stage trial.  The drug is a next-generation version of a class of oft-prescribed antibiotics called macrolides, which are used to fight pathogens that cause community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CAPB).  ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT  CAPB is the leading cause of death emanating from an infection and is characterized by shortness of breath, cough and fever, with about 5-10 million cases in the United States per year.  An oral formulation of solithromycin was as effective as Bayer AG's moxifloxacin in evoking a clinical response at 72 hours after dosing — the study's main goal.  Data showed solithromycin actually outperformed moxifloxacin by a slight margin, Cempra said on Sunday.  The drug's ""impressive"" safety profile, particularly its low degree of gastrointestinal toxicity, drew praise from Baird's Brian Skorney, who raised his price target on the stock by $11 to $32.  Prior-generation macrolides have triggered safety concerns in the past, including Sanofi SA's telithromycin which was associated with liver toxicity, and Pfizer Inc's azithromycin, which has been linked with heart risk.  The unparalleled rate at which the oral version of solithromycin is absorbed in the blood, or its oral bioavailability, differentiates it from standard treatments, Chief Executive Prabha Fernandes told Reuters in an interview in November.  Jefferies analysts have previously noted a bioavailability of 80 percent for solithromycin versus 28 percent for azithromycin, a sign of superior effectiveness and lower rates of resistance.  North Carolina-based Cempra is also evaluating an intravenous formulation of solithromycin for CAPB.  The drug is also the first pediatric antibiotic-in-development in nearly three decades, according to Fernandes.  In the face of escalating antimicrobial resistance, investors have showered interest on the anti-superbug drugmaker, following Merck & Co's announcement to acquire Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc, as Big Pharma revives investment in antibiotic research.  While Cempra has said it plans to stay independent, the company is not averse to acquiring other molecules after filing to market solithromycin, Fernandes said.  ""We can always get a gram-negative drug — that would be nice to add to the portfolio, to be a really full blown anti-infective company, and then we need to find a partner!""  Solithromycin is commercially licensed to Fujifilm Holdings Corp in Japan.  The stock closed at $22.89 on the Nasdaq on Friday."	1
A new method for performing a “virtual” colonoscopy that requires less unpleasant preparation was shown in a new study to accurately detect larger precancerous polyps—and was a better experience for patients.  The second-leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. after lung cancer, colon cancer can be prevented if precancerous polyps—known as adenomas—are found and removed during a colonoscopy. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, if everyone 50 or older were regularly screened, as many as 60% of deaths could be avoided.  But Dr. Michael Zalis, a radiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, tells the Health Blog that many people may avoid this procedure because the preparation, which requires patients to cleanse their colons with a laxative, is so unpleasant. In addition, some patients fear the instrument used in the procedure, or have concerns about the risks from anesthesia or of perforation of the bowel.  “No one should be dying from colon cancer, which is almost completely preventable with screening; and if it were sufficiently easy more people would do it,” says Zalis, lead author of the study published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine.  In recent years, the use of computed tomographic colonography—known as CT or “virtual” colonoscopy—has eliminated the need for the most invasive part of the procedure. But though these virtual scans are performed externally, patients still have to take the laxatives so the scanning machines can read the empty colon.  So, the researchers developed a software program to electronically “cleanse” the bowel, Zalis says. Prior to a scan, researchers asked patients to adhere to a low-fiber diet for a few days and drink a special fluid to “tag” the colon’s contents. After performing the CT scan, the software electronically identified polyps.  The researchers screened 605 patients with the laxative-free CT scan and followed up with traditional colonoscopy to find out how successfully the virtual method detected precancerous polyps of six millimeters or more. The laxative-free scan accurately identified 91% of patients with polyps of 10 mm or larger -- those at highest risk of becoming cancerous -- but was less accurate for smaller lesions, the study says.  Dr. James Aisenberg, a gastroenterologist and clinical professor of medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, agrees that, for some people, the laxative requirement can be a barrier to colorectal screening.  However, like virtual colonoscopy in general, laxative-free CTC “will miss a subset of precancerous polyps and thus is unlikely to become the gold standard for colorectal-cancer prevention,” says Dr. Aisenberg, who wasn’t involved with the study.  However, the laxative-free method “may become a useful alternative for persons who won't otherwise undergo screening, and is much better than no screening at all.”  Dr. Zalis and some of his co-investigators developed the software. The American Cancer Society, the National Institutes of Health and General Electric Co.’s health-care unit—which markets scanning devices and accessories—supported the researchers. Dr. Zalis says the company had no influence on the study.	0
"Health Experts Call For Heart Checkups For Kids  Enlarge this image toggle caption Michael Perez/AP Michael Perez/AP  In growing numbers, health experts are recommending screening for heart disease in children, especially those who play sports.  One in 100,000 people ages 12 to 24 are estimated to die suddenly and unexpectedly as a result of congenital undiagnosed heart malfunctions. And children who play sports are nearly three times more likely to suffer sudden cardiac death than their nonathletic counterparts.  ""Few of the kids actually experience sudden death while they're in class or at home,"" says Thomas Debauche, a Houston cardiologist. ""It's pretty much while they're in training or while they're on the field performing, because that's when the adrenalin is flowing,"" and that's when they're calling on the heart for peak performance.  These surprise attacks are due to inherited problems that children are born with. Cardiologist Douglas Zipes, past president of the American Academy of Cardiology, says the problems kids suffer are typically electrical, like abnormal heart rhythms, or structural, like a thickening of the heart muscle. Both of these problems are exacerbated during exertion when kids play sports.  According to Zipes, ""The adrenalin that is released when you're participating [in sports] can stimulate this abnormally thick heart muscle and cause a fatal heart rhythm problem, that is a very rapid heartbeat with no effective contraction, no blood being ejected to the brain and other organs."" The result is sudden cardiac death.  Typically, schools require kids to provide a family history and have a simple physical exam before participating in sports. But Zipes says more should be done.  Cardiologist Debauche agrees. He recently screened more than 2,000 high school athletes in the Houston area, using electrocardiogram, or EKG, to measure the electrical activity of the heart.  About 10 percent of the students had an abnormal EKG. One of them was Louis Anthony, who suffered from asthma. In severe cases, asthma can cause the heart to thicken and put kids at risk of cardiomyopathy and sudden death. Anthony's asthma diminished over time, and he says he can still play soccer, run fast and breathe ""just fine.""  After the abnormal EKG result, however, Debauche told Anthony and his parents to closely monitor the asthma. They have.  For other students who had abnormal EKG results, some received medication for blood pressure and others were treated for abnormal heart rhythms. About 1 percent were told it was too dangerous for them to continue in sports.  Three students had serious heart problems, including one who suffered from a rare disease in which the heart muscle is spongy and contracts poorly.  ""He was literally running the stadium stairs at the time we found him,"" Debauche says. ""He was preparing for track season by running up and down the stadium stairs.""  Debauche says the heart screening turned out to be life-saving for this student athlete. The student now has an implantable defibrillator and is awaiting a heart transplant.  The severity of this and the other two problems that turned up as a result of the abnormal EKGs are reason enough, Debauche says, to screen all school athletes nationwide.  Some health experts argue that would be too costly. There's no official policy from the American College of Cardiology, but officials say most members support screening student athletes.  The American Heart Association suggests that athletes who are identified as at risk for heart problems as a result of a family history or physical exam be referred for further cardiovascular examination, which could include an electrocardiogram."	1
There’s some good news and some bad news for women who took estrogen to help them get through menopause until the health risks of taking the hormone were discovered.  A new analysis of the landmark Women’s Health Initiative, the federal study that discovered the health risks, indicates that women who stopped using estrogen after the dangers were uncovered are no longer at increased risk for strokes and blood clots about 10 years after they stopped. At the same time, the women continued to be at a lower risk for breast cancer. That’s the good news.  The bad news is that there is no benefit of being less likely to develop heart disease, and any reduction in the risk of hip bone fractures evaporates with time, according to a report in the latest issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.  For years, women took estrogen or a combination of estrogen and progestin to help alleviate hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause, and in the belief that the drugs had a host of health benefits, including protecting their hearts. But the Women’s Health Initiative stunned doctors and women when researchers reported that the risks of the hormones outweighed any benefits. Hormone use plummetted, but women who had been using the drugs were left to wonder whether they were still at risk.  In the new analysis, researchers analyzed data collected from 7,645 women who were in the part of the study examining the effects of taking estrogen alone an average of 10.7 years, after the study was halted because of the evidence the drugs were harming women. The women had taken estrogen for about six years.  The researchers found that the risk for heart disease during the follow-up period was similar to that seen while the women were taking the hormone. But the increased risk for strokes and blood clots disappeared and the protective effect for breast cancer persisted. The protective effect for hip fractures disappeared. In fact, the women who took the hormone ended up being at somewhat higher risk for fractures.  In an editorial accompanying the study, Emily Jungheim and Graham Colditz of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis wrote that the findings indicate that while there “may still be a role for short-term use of unopposed estrogen for treating some women with menopausal symptoms ... this role may be vanishing as existing and emerging data continue to be better understood.”  Rowan Chlebowski, one of the researchers who worked on the analysis, stressed that the study only looked at women who were taking estrogen alone. Women who took a combination of estrogen and progestin face increased risk for breast cancer, previous studies have shown, Chlebowski said.	0
NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Swedish teenagers who consumed more folic acid got better school grades, a small study published in the journal Pediatrics has found.  But don’t run out and stock up on the B vitamin with the rest of your school supplies just yet, one expert warns.  “There is very little deficiency of folic acid in North America,” Deborah O’Connor, a nutrition researcher who was not involved in the study, told Reuters Health. “If you’re already sufficient, there is not a lot of evidence that taking more supplements will help.”  She said the teens in the study might have been deficient in folic acid, with levels a few times lower than what’s typically seen in North American kids.  Because a lack of the nutrient during pregnancy can cause severe birth defects in babies, certain foods are fortified with folic acid, also called folate, in North America. Most of the population is thought to get adequate amounts for that reason.  During the study, Sweden did not fortify foods, nor did kids use a lot of supplements. Folic acid is naturally present in green, leafy vegetables and legumes.  The new study is among the first to examine whether folate is tied to school achievements, according to Dr. Torbjorn Nilsson of Orebro University Hospital and his colleagues.  The researchers looked at 386 15-year-olds who were finishing up ninth grade. When all their grades from ten core classes were added up, there was a clear difference between teens who got the most and the least folic acid in their diets.  Teens in the top third of folic acid intake — more than 253 micrograms per day for girls and 335 for boys — scored grades of 139 out of 200, on average. Those in the bottom third — less than 173 micrograms folic acid per day for girls and 227 for boys — had an average score of only 120.  The differences remained even after the researchers accounted for gender, smoking, the mothers’ education and which schools the kids went to.  O’Connor, of the University of Toronto and the Hospital for Sick Children in Ontario, Canada, called the findings “pretty significant.”  Still, she said, you can’t be sure if the kids who performed better had a better diet in general or if some other hidden factor could explain the results.  “It’s not a randomized controlled trial, so you always wonder, are there other things going on that you weren’t able to control for?” she said. “Like most studies, it probably raises more questions than it answers.”  In the U.S., kids aged 9 to 13 should get a total of 300 micrograms of folate a day from food and supplements according to the Institute of Medicine’s “Dietary Reference Intakes.” Kids 14 and older and adults are urged to get 400 micrograms a day and pregnant women should get 600 micrograms.

"Eating More — Or Less — Of 10 Foods May Cut Risk Of Early Death  Enlarge this image toggle caption Paul Taylor/Getty Images Paul Taylor/Getty Images  About half of all U.S. deaths from heart disease, stroke and Type 2 diabetes are linked to poor diets, according to a new study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.  And eating more — or less — of just 10 types of food can help raise or lower the risk of death from these causes, the researchers found.  Scientists at Tufts University identified the foods that seem to contribute the most to the risk. At the top of the list? Salt. Consuming too much salt was associated with 9.5 percent of the deaths.  Next — and I sympathize with all of you who love to eat these — high intake of red meat and processed meats such as bacon was linked to 8 percent of the deaths. And sugary drinks were a factor in 7.4 percent of the deaths.  We know, it may be tough to cut back on foods you love. Bacon is so alluring to many that it has even been called the 'gateway' to meat for vegetarians!  But, here's the flip side: The researchers also found there's a significant risk in eating too little of certain healthy foods. So, think of it this way: You can start consuming more of the foods that are protective.  For instance, the study found that low consumption of nuts and seeds was linked to about 9 percent of deaths.  In addition, diets low in seafood, whole grains and fruits and vegetables were found to contribute to about 6-8 percent of the deaths.  Enlarge this image toggle caption John Lawson/Belhaven/Getty Images John Lawson/Belhaven/Getty Images  ""The good news is that we now understand which foods we need to target to prevent Americans from dying prematurely from cardiometabolic diseases,"" says lead study author Renata Micha, a public health nutritionist and epidemiologist at the Friedman School at Tufts University.  In 2012, about 700,000 Americans died from these diseases. Diet was linked to nearly 319,000 of these deaths. ""This is a remarkable burden, nearly 1,000 deaths each day"" linked to dietary habits, says senior study author Dariush Mozaffarian, dean of the Friedman School at Tufts.  So, changing Americans dietary habits could have a significant impact, the authors argue. ""Our research suggests that nearly half of the risk can be reduced [by] eating a healthy diet,"" Mozaffarian says.  The new analysis is based on data from the federal survey known as NHANES, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Researchers asked some 8,500 participants about their eating habits. In addition, Mozaffarian and his colleagues estimated associations of diet and disease from prior studies and clinical trials.  Now, the task of estimating death or disease linked to diet is tricky. Scientists use statistical methods to try to tease apart the impact of diet as part of people's overall lifestyle.  One challenge: People who have healthy diets often have other healthy habits, too — such as getting regular exercise. Dietary habits also track with socio-economic status. So, people with lower incomes are more likely to have poorer diets compared with wealthier people.  The Tufts researchers used studies that had controlled for these lifestyle factors, but it's not a perfect science.  ""Relying on evidence from observational studies...carries the potential limitation of confounding bias,"" states an editorial that was published alongside the study. The editorial raises the possibility that the effect of confounding factors such as socioeconomic status and physical activity could be substantial. ""For instance, it's possible that processed meat consumption merely reflects a Westernized dietary pattern.""  Mozaffarian acknowledges the limitations. ""At the end of the day, our findings might modestly over - or under-estimate the health burdens,"" he told us.  He says the bigger point is this: ""Whether poor diet is causing 1,000 cardiovascular and diabetes deaths per day, or 500, it remains among the leading causes of preventable suffering.""  Poor diets are also linked to billions of dollars in healthcare spending. For instance, diabetes costs the U.S. $245 billion a year. In the U.S., a women with diabetes incurs, on average, about $283,000 in lifetime health care costs. (Many cost studies don't separate Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes.)  If you love foods that are associated with cardiovascular risks, you don't have to give them up entirely. As most nutrition studies show, it's excessive consumption that drives up the risk.  For instance, dietary guidelines recommend limiting sugar consumption to no more than 10 percent of daily calories. This means that a single 200-calorie sugary drink may be OK for a person who typically consumes a 2,000 calorie-per-day diet.  The problem: Most Americans consume much more."	0

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A daily dose of electricity delivered to a specific part of the brain can lift depression, new research confirms, even for people who’ve already tried multiple antidepressants to no avail.  While there’s evidence that this technique, known as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), helps depressed people get better-and the US Food and Drug Administration has approved TMS for this purpose-many skeptics have questioned whether it really works, notes Dr. Mark S. George of the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, the lead author of the new study.  The biggest issue with studies so far, he explained, has been that it’s tough to fake the sound and sensation of the real device in order to run a gold standard clinical trial in which some people get the treatment, and others get a sham treatment, no one knowing which.  But George and his team say they’ve solved that problem by developing a dummy device that clicks in a similar way to the real thing and causes a person’s eye muscles to twitch, just like real a TMS device.  In the May issue of the Archives of General Psychiatry, George and his colleagues report the results of their 190-patient study, the most rigorous investigation of TMS for depression so far. The researchers randomly assigned participants to receive 37.5 minutes of TMS delivered to a part of the brain region that plays a role in emotion, or 37.5 minutes of sham TMS, once a day for three weeks.  After three weeks, 14 percent of patients in the real TMS group had recovered from their depression, compared to 5 percent of the sham TMS group; people who had the real treatment were four times as likely to get better as those who got the fake treatment.  Based on the results, George and his team say, it would be necessary to treat 12 depressed patients with TMS in order to have one patient recover.  Eighty-eight percent of the study participants completed the first phase of the trial. Patients in both groups were equally likely to report side effects, which included headache, discomfort at the TMS site, and eye twitching.  In a second phase of the study, all patients were given the real TMS treatment. Thirty percent of the patients in the second phase recovered from depression.  How long the treatment should last is not yet clear. “It’s very muddy now exactly how long we need to treat patients,” George said. “It looks as if from this trial you at least need to try three weeks and maybe even six weeks before you would give up.”  Patients who got better were prescribed venlafaxine - marketed as Effexor — and a small dose of lithium, noted George, a combination that’s been shown to help people stay well after their depression has remitted. George said he and his colleagues would like to study whether giving people TMS intermittently instead of putting them on antidepressants would produce equally durable effects.  TMS works by producing an electrical current that can pass through the skull and into the target area of the brain. George said he believes the approach works by “resetting” electrical activity and restoring normal mood regulation.  Something similar is likely happening, he added, with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), or what is sometimes referred to as “electroshock treatment.” Sixty to 70 percent of depressed people who undergo ECT, in which electrodes placed on the front of the brain induce a convulsion while the patient is anesthetized, will recover.  George said he hopes that by better understanding where TMS should be delivered and by figuring out the best dose and duration of treatment, success rates closer to those of ECT might be achieved. “I’m optimistic that it’s pointing us in a path of understanding how to interact with the brain in a non-invasive way to get people well.”  SOURCE: Archives of General Psychiatry, May 2010.	0
NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - There may be a seed of truth amidst the many health claims for pomegranate juice, researchers from Israel said Thursday, at least for kidney patients on dialysis.  They found that such patients who gulped a few cups of the tart liquid every week lowered their chances of infections, the second-leading killer of the more than 350,000 Americans on dialysis.  The findings were presented at the American Society of Nephrology’s meeting in Denver — aka Renal Week — and have not yet been vetted by independent experts.  “It’s a very intriguing study,” said Dr. Frank Brosius, who heads the nephrology division at the University of Michigan Health System and was not involved in the research.  “I certainly don’t know of anything else that would have such a profound effect,” he told Reuters Health, cautioning at the same time that the study needed to be replicated by other centers.  The results come in the wake of a U.S. crackdown on allegedly false advertising by POM Wonderful, which claims its pomegranate products can help everything from heart disease to prostate cancer and erectile dysfunction.  The Israeli researchers, led by Dr. Batya Kristal of Western Galilee Hospital in Nahariya, did not use POM juice, but a brand sold by Naturafood.  In lab tests, Kristal told Reuters Health, that brand ranked highest in polyphenol antioxidants, which can reduce cell damage caused by so-called free radicals.  Antioxidants are found in different levels in fruits and vegetables, such as blueberries or broccoli.  “Pomegranate juice was shown in the last three years to contain the highest levels of polyphenols among a variety of products,” Kristal said. “Much higher than red wine, for instance.”  The researchers figured an antioxidant-rich diet might help patients with kidney failure, because the level of free radicals in their blood increases as the blood circulates through the dialysis device. That, in turn, may rev up inflammation in their tissues.  In the study, funded by the Israeli Ministry of Health, 101 patients were randomly assigned to either a concoction without pomegranate juice, or the real thing.  After downing about half a cup three times a week over a year, those who drank the real thing had a reduction of inflammatory molecules in their blood.  They also made fewer trips to the hospital.  “We found significant reductions in hospitalization due to infections, with more than 40 percent reduction in the first hospitalization and 80 percent in the second,” said Kristal.  However, the researchers were only able to rule out chance as the cause of the reduction in the second visit to the hospital.  According to the findings, among 50 patients drinking pomegranate juice for a year, about two would have to go to the hospital at least twice. By comparison, that number would be nearly 11 in patients not drinking the juice.  The researchers say they don’t know if their results extend to other brands as well, and suggest squeezing your own juice. A 16-oz bottle of POM Wonderful sells for about $4.  She said her team had found no side effects, but added that kidney patients should be aware of the high potassium content in the juice, given the delicate balance of nutrients in their blood, and talk to their doctor if they consider drinking it.  Brosius was skeptical of the benefits, although he said the juice was unlikely to cause harm.  “I would prefer to see this validated at other centers before we come out and say this is the thing to do,” he said. Even if the findings hold up, he said, it is still unclear what accounts for them. “Who the heck knows what the active ingredients are?”  Marion Nestle, a nutrition expert at New York University, said the effects might not be unique to pomegranate juice.  “This study does not demonstrate anything special about pomegranate juice,” she told Reuters Health in an e-mail. “The effects of juice were compared to a placebo, not to any other kind of juice that might have exactly the same effect.”  “The pomegranate people are spending millions to prove what I could have told them in the first place,” she added. “Pomegranate juices — like most if not all fruit and vegetable juices — have antioxidant activity. Does this make pomegranates better than any other fruit? Investigators have yet to show this.”	0
"En Español  By Serena Gordon  HealthDay Reporter  TUESDAY, April 12, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Eating apples every day may be good for your cardiovascular health, new research suggests.  Women who ate dried apples every day for a year lowered their total cholesterol by 14 percent and their levels of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol by 23 percent.  ""I never expected apple consumption to reduce bad cholesterol to this extent while increasing HDL cholesterol or good cholesterol by about 4 percent,"" Bahram Arjmandi, chair of the department of nutrition, food and exercise sciences at Florida State University in Tallahassee, said in a statement.  Arjmandi was to present the findings Tuesday at the Experimental Biology meeting in Washington D.C. The U.S. Department of Agriculture provided partial funding for the study.  Many foods can have an effect on cholesterol levels, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Foods containing saturated fats, trans fats and dietary cholesterol can raise your cholesterol levels, while foods with healthier fats such as olive oil can lower your cholesterol. Foods with fiber, such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains, can reduce cholesterol levels, while carbohydrates that are low in fiber tend to raise triglyceride levels and lower ""good"" HDL cholesterol levels.  In the current study, the researchers wanted to assess the long-term effect that apple consumption might have on cardiovascular health.  They recruited 160 women between the ages of 45 and 65. The women were randomly assigned to one of two dietary intervention groups. One group was given 75 grams of dried apples every day for a year, while the other group was given dried prunes daily for a year.  The daily serving of dried apples contained about 240 calories, according to the study. An apple contains about 5 grams of fiber, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.  The researchers found that women eating dried apples lowered their total cholesterol by 14 percent. LDL cholesterol dropped by 23 percent. Daily apple consumption also significantly lowered levels of C-reactive protein and lipid hydroperoxide, two substances that may indicate an increased risk of heart disease. What effects, if any, the prunes had on cholesterol levels were not mentioned in the study abstract.  The researchers theorized that the nutrients in apples may reduce inflammation in the body.  Despite the addition of several hundred calories a day to their diet, the apple-eating women didn't gain weight over the course of the study. In fact, they lost an average of 3.3 pounds.  Registered dietician Jessica Shapiro said she wasn't surprised that the women didn't gain weight. The addition of apples to the diet probably kept the women feeling fuller because of the fiber content in the apples, she explained.  ""Apples really are an amazing fruit for many reasons,"" said Shapiro, who is a clinical nutritionist who counsels cardiac patients at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City. ""A large reason apples are so good is the fiber. Apples have both soluble and insoluble fiber. Insoluble is found more in the skin, and the pulp is more soluble fiber.""  ""The pulp of an apple gets to be a very viscous gel-like substance that grabs cholesterol and pulls it out of the body. It's kind of like nature's toothbrush, and it's brushing the bad stuff out,"" she explained.  ""Another good thing in apples is pectin. It's a substance that's used to make jellies or jams, and pectin contributes to the viscosity of what's going through the body, and bulks it up to help remove it. Apples also have tons of antioxidants and other natural components,"" she said.  Shapiro said she would recommend fresh apples over dried apples, because some nutrients are probably lost in the drying process.  But Shapiro stressed that making healthy changes to what you eat can only do so much.  ""Changing your diet can make a big difference, but eating a healthy diet is only part of it. Once your cholesterol is high, diet may not be enough,"" she said. ""Some people are predisposed because of their genes to having high cholesterol, and a healthy diet may not be enough.""  Shapiro also advised against making any changes to your medications, including cholesterol-lowering drugs, without talking to your doctor first.  Also, she cautioned, when increasing the fiber in your diet, do it slowly. This will help prevent bloating and gas that may occur if you increase your fiber intake too quickly. She said that 25 to 30 grams of fiber daily is the recommended intake, and she suggested increasing your current intake by about 5 grams daily each week to give your body a chance to get used to the increased fiber.

"From a crusty baguette to a big thick steak, some foods may be hard to digest, particularly as we age. Enzyme capsules taken before a meal can relieve discomfort by helping the body to break down problem foods, say companies that sell the pills. Doctors say some enzyme supplements work well, but others need more human studies.  Digestive enzymes are proteins that work like scissors to break down foods. The pancreas, where many of these enzymes are made, can slow down as we age, which can result in bloating and other gastrointestinal discomfort, says Steven Lamm, clinical assistant professor at New York University School of Medicine and a paid consultant to Enzymedica Inc., a Venice, Fla., company that sells enzyme capsules. Gastroenterologists say it is true the pancreas can slow down with age, but gastrointestinal upsets can be from many causes.  Prescription enzymes are often given to patients who have ""pancreatic insufficiency,"" in which the pancreas doesn't make enough enzymes to digest food, doctors say. But many people with milder gastrointestinal problems—such as gas and bloating—are turning to enzymatic dietary supplements for relief. Sales of over-the-counter digestive enzymes in the U.S. hit $136 million in the past 12 months, up 4% from two years ago, according to Spins LLC, a Schaumburg, Ill., market-research firm.  The concept of an over-the-counter enzyme blend seems ""reasonable"" but ""there are not high-quality, well-designed studies"" that prove they work in humans, says Lin Chang, director of the digestive health and nutrition clinic at the University of California in Los Angeles.  Also, says David Whitcomb, a professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, many over-the-counter enzymes are made in fungi—resulting in proteins that digest food efficiently but haven't been tested for humans.  The first over-the-counter enzymes to hit the U.S. market had narrow applications. Lactase, an enzyme that digests a sugar in milk and is lacking in lactose-intolerant people, went on sale in pill form in the 1980s. In 1991, alpha-galactosidase, which aids in digesting beans, cabbage and broccoli, appeared under the brand name Beano, now sold by Medtech Products Inc., Tarrytown, N.Y. Lactase works well, doctors say, and at least four small, published human trials have found the main ingredient in Beano can reduce gas after a meal of beans.  Many newer products aimed at a broader spectrum of foods and digestive concerns are now on the market, but they haven't been tested in human trials. Enzymedica's Digest Gold is a blend of enzymes, including proteases for digesting protein; amylase, for starches and lipase, for fat. Mega-Zyme, sold by a North American unit of Germany's Dr. Willmar Schwabe GmbH & Co. in Green Bay, Wis., contains a powerful enzyme blend the company's website says can ""help relieve occasional gas and bloating.""  Neither company has done clinical trials on its enzyme products, though Enzymedica says it is planning human trials. Both companies say lab tests show their enzymes do what they are expected to do. For example, says Jeremy Appleton, a naturopathic doctor at Schwabe, proteases are tested to make sure they efficiently break down proteins. He says Schwabe doesn't know of any side effects but adds people with fungal allergies should use the products with caution.  A number of products, such Enzymedica's Gluten Ease 2x, which hit the market last year, are aimed at people who get sick from eating gluten. Humans haven't evolved with the ability to fully digest gluten, says Alessio Fasano, director of the Center for Celiac Research at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. In most people, gluten doesn't cause problems, but in people with celiac disease, it causes an autoimmune reaction, Dr. Fasano says. People with ""gluten sensitivity"" can have symptoms such as stomach aches, joint pain, fatigue and headaches, he adds.  Enzymedica's website notes the product isn't for celiac patients, who need to avoid even trace amounts of gluten. Dr. Fasano agrees, but says patients with gluten sensitivity could try the enzymes. But since the enzymes can work slowly, he says he is skeptical the capsules will work fast enough for many patients, who experience symptoms in minutes or hours.  Enzymedica founder Tom Bohager says lab tests show the product works quickly—with an average of 60% large gluten molecules broken down in a half-hour and 75% at 90 minutes. The company says customers have reported only occasional side effects—such as stomach cramping. In the case of cramps, the company recommends reducing the dose.  —Email aches@wsj.com"	1
"July 7, 2010 -- The FDA says it has approved the use of micro-sized implantable telescopes to improve vision in patients with end-stage, age-related macular degeneration.  The tiny device, called an Implantable Miniature Telescope (IMT), is designed to replace the natural lens. It provides an image that has been magnified more than two times, the FDA says in a news release.  Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a condition that affects older people. It damages the center of the retina, or macula, and results in a loss of vision in the center of the visual field. There are two forms of AMD, a wet form and a dry form.  About 8 million people in the U.S. suffer from this condition, and nearly 2 million of them already have significant loss of vision. The device is intended for patients 75 and older with severe to profound vision impairment that has been stable over time due to blind spots from end-stage AMD.  ""This innovation has the potential to provide many people with an improved quality of life,"" Jeffrey Shuren, MD, JD, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, says in the news release.  The IMT comes in two models; one model provides 2.2 times magnification and the other 2.7 times. It is designed to magnify and project images onto a healthy portion of the afflicted person's retina. It is intended for use in only one eye because the other eye is used for peripheral vision, the FDA says.  Before implantation, patients will be trained with an external telescopic device to see if they may benefit from the product. Training would also be needed to verify that there is sufficient peripheral vision in the untreated eye.  The miniature telescope was developed by VisionCare Ophthalmic Technologies Inc. of Saratoga, Calif.  ""This is truly a breakthrough technology for AMD patients as their treatment options have been limited until now,"" says Kathryn A. Colby, MD, PhD, an ophthalmic surgeon at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston and an assistant professor of ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School."	0
"Routine Mammograms: A Close Call  So should U.S. women continue to get routine mammograms? It's a ""close call,"" says H. Gilbert Welch, MD, MPH, of the Dartmouth Institute in Lebanon, N.H.  ""This is a test that women who want it should be able to have,"" Welch tells WebMD. ""But it should not be jammed down people's throats. ... The system we are working in leads doctors to coax, scare, and coerce women into having this test.""  Why would a woman at normal risk of breast cancer want to get routine mammograms? The obvious answer is that these tests save lives.  How many lives? If the full 10% drop in breast cancer deaths among screened women in the Norwegian study is totally due to mammograms themselves -- Welch calls this an optimistic assumption -- one life is saved for every 2,500 women who get regular mammograms.  But what's the harm of routine mammograms?  ""The biggest harm is you are treated for breast cancer unnecessarily, for a cancer that was never going to cause problems,"" Welch says. ""Because we don't know which cancers these are, all cancers are treated. This means some women will undergo needless surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. On balance, this is about five to 15 of those 2,500 women screened.""  Moreover, a large number of screened women will have worrisome mammogram results.  ""Among the 2,500 women screened, at least 1,000 will be told something looks wrong on their mammogram, and they will have to worry that they have cancer,"" Welch says. ""The vast majority will turn out not to have cancer, but all of them will worry.""  Welch notes that many women may find that the benefits of routine mammograms outweigh these risks.  ""Every woman has to make her own decision about how to weigh these very dissimilar things,"" Welch says. ""Some will benefit in a very large way. But to achieve that benefit, a lot of others will have to go through something with very negative effects. It is not wrong to want a routine mammogram, and it is not wrong not to want one."""	0
Sept. 17, 2010 -- The FDA has approved Krystexxa (pegloticase) for the treatment of gout.  Krystexxa is for adults with long-standing chronic gout who do not improve with or cannot tolerate other treatments. The drug is associated with some serious side effects.  Gout occurs when uric acid builds up in the body and forms crystals in the joints or in soft tissue. The crystals cause swelling, redness, pain, and stiffness in the joints. The condition is associated with obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. Gout is more common among men and postmenopausal women, and people with kidney disease.  Krystexxa, which is made by Savient Pharmaceuticals Inc. of East Brunswick, N.J., is an enzyme that lowers uric acid levels by metabolizing it into a chemical that does not cause bodily damage and is then passed through the urine.  The drug is administered to patients every two weeks as an intravenous infusion.  Two six-month clinical trials of 212 total patients showed that the drug lowered uric acid levels and reduced deposits of uric acid crystals in joints and soft tissue. Savient expects Krystexxa to be available by prescription later this year.	1
"A new, experimental cholesterol-fighting drug is creating quite a buzz among researchers and other experts, prompting some to use words such as ""dramatic,"" ""breakthrough"" and ""game changing,"" to describe early-stage clinical trial results.  If these initial results pan out in larger trials, the drug could prove to be more effective than statins, the widely prescribed drugs which have been very successful in lowering levels of LDL - or bad cholesterol.  Researchers have known for some time that when the protein PCSK9, which stands for proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin 9, binds to LDL receptors on the liver, it compromises the organ's ability to filter the bad cholesterol from the blood.    Too much LDL cholesterol circulating in the blood can lead to the thickening of artery walls, making them less flexible and therefore impairing their function and increasing the risk of heart disease.  In this phase one clinical trial, which is designed to determine if a drug is safe, researchers found that using a monoclonal antibody (lab-produced protein) called REGN727, was not only safe, but effectively blocked PCSK9 and therefore signficantly reduced bad cholesterol in healthy patients as well as those also taking the popular cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor.  Earlier studies had shown this effect in primates, but this new study, published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, provides the first clinical trial data for testing the drug on humans. This new drug is being developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals and Sanofi, who funded the research.  “Wars for PCSK9 are far bigger than the statin wars,"" said Dr. Evan A Stein, lead author of the study and researcher at the Metabolic and Atherosclerosis Research Center in Cincinnati, Ohio. “This is a hot research area and everybody is so close together.""  Other companies including Amgen, Merck & Company, Novartis and Pfizer, are also hot on the trail developing their own PCSK9 inhibitor drugs. Stein said.  Additional results for PCSK9 inhibitor drugs are expected to be presented at the annual American College of Cardiology meeting which begins Saturday in Chicago, he said.  The REGN727 study included three trial arms. Two arms used 72 healthy volunteers who were either injected with a single dose of the drug in increasing amounts to test for side effects, which is the purpose of a phase one clinical trial. A third arm included 21 people with a family history of high cholesterol, and 30 people with nonfamilial high cholesterol. All of those subjects were also receiving treatment with the statin Lipitor.  A control group of subjects with nonfamilial high cholesterol was treated only with a special diet. None of the subjects who received REGN727 discontinued the study because of adverse effects, and the subjects who received REGN727 had a striking reduction of 60 to 65% in LDL cholesterol, according to Stein.  Stein characterized the results of the trial as “pretty dramatic.”  A PCSK9 inhibitor, Stein said, differs from statins ""because it's unlike any other drug. With statins you get toxicity – with these drugs we don’t see any side effects with the antibody.”  In an accompanying editorial, authors Dr. Stephen G. Young, and Loren G. Fong, Ph.D. write: “At this point, the status of PCSK9 therapeutics appears to be full speed ahead. Soon, we can expect more human trials in which investigators will dissect the properties of different PCSK9 antibodies and assess the effect of these agents.”  However, without long-term safety data and evidence that PCSK9 inhibitors truly help prevent heart disease, Young and Fong caution that it will remain unclear how important this class of drugs will be.  The cost of this drug will also play a role in determining which patients might use it, Fong and Young say. But they also note that ""patients who cannot tolerate statins could benefit greatly.""  If the results are confirmed, “This is game changing science,” said Dr. Richard A. Stein, a spokesman for the American Heart Association who's not related to the study author or involved in the research.  Stein called the trial results “a very important breakthrough,"" while being careful to note that they represent early science which should be confirmed through larger and longer studies.  He said the study methodology was thorough because it included people with high cholesterol as well as people with genetic familial high cholesterol, which is proven to be a result of impaired PCSK9 genetic function."	0
