According to a U.S. government advisory panel, almost no one should get screened for prostate cancer. But a new study this week reflects the continued view of many physicians — that screening does help to catch tumors earlier. To screen or not to screen: here's why experts still can't agree  Mike Albans / NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images PSA blood testing at Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn, N.Y.  If you’re wondering why experts still can’t agree on prostate-cancer screening, you’re not alone.  Just two months ago, a major U.S. government panel said that basically no one should get screened for prostate cancer, claiming the simple blood test for prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, does more harm than good. Now, a new study looks at government data and finds that, without PSA testing, the U.S. would have three times as many patients each year diagnosed with advanced-stage prostate cancer — and the vast majority of those cases would be fatal.  “Almost all men with clinically apparent metastases at initial diagnosis will die from prostate cancer,” urologist and study author Edward Messing told reporters, as he explained the importance of his study.  The new study reflects a broader divide in the medical community, between public health experts who have largely turned away from PSA screening, and many practicing clinicians who feel the test has helped their patients immensely.  (MORE: Men Should Forgo PSA Testing, U.S. Panel Advises)  No one denies that PSA tests can help to catch prostate cancer early. But two issues are still unresolved. One is how well screening can actually work to prevent cancer deaths; the other is what kind of negative effects screening brings along with its benefits.  On the first issue, there is still some uncertainty. In the U.S., a large randomized trial found no mortality benefit of screening. But an even larger randomized clinical trial in Europe has found a benefit. In its latest results published this spring, the European study team said that men who undergo routine testing have significantly lower risk of prostate-cancer death after 11 years.  Still, the real crux of the debate on PSA testing is the second issue: the possible negative effects of screening. No diagnostic test is 100% accurate, and if a PSA test comes back positive for prostate cancer, the patient will usually be referred for a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. That test can have side effects. Then, if the patient does have cancer, the available treatments for it — surgery, radiation, as well as other options — also have side effects, chief among them impotence, incontinence, and urinary incontinence. The same European trial that found lower cancer mortality with PSA testing also found that, to save just one life through screening, an extra 37 men would need to be diagnosed with prostate cancer and treated. Many health experts think that’s too much risky treatment to justify the results.  So when the government advisory panel — the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force — recommends against routine PSA testing, it’s making a judgment call. It’s saying that, for most men, the (albeit small) risk of sexual dysfunction and urinary leakage from eventual treatment is not worth it, given the even smaller chance that PSA testing could save your life. But that decision does remain a judgment call. It depends on how much you value certain quality-of-life measures versus how much you value having any life at all.  (MORE: Surgery for Early Prostate Cancer Doesn’t Save Lives)  As for the new paper this week, which suggests that three times as many men would be diagnosed each year with metastatic prostate cancer if it weren’t for PSA testing, that study is published in the journal Cancer — and its numbers deserve a little explanation. To calculate the total number of metastatic cases we’d get without screening, the study takes today’s population of the United States and applies the rates (broken down by age and race) of advanced-stage prostate cancer that were observed before PSA testing was introduced — that is, the rates way back in 1983-85.  In other words, it tells us what the current U.S. population would look like if today we faced the same risks that Americans faced in the ’80s; it finds we’d have roughly 25,000 U.S. men diagnosed with advanced-stage prostate cancer each year compared to just 8,000 today. But is going back in time 30 years really the same thing that we’d get if we abolished PSA testing today? Who knows? The rate of new diagnoses of all cancer types combined has been falling consistently in recent years. However, prostate cancer is one of the few cancers that’s not strongly linked to smoking (and falling cigarette consumption over the past 40 years is a major reason for falling cancer rates). It is, however, linked to obesity, which has been on the rise since the 1980s.  One further fact to keep in mind is that PSA testing works to cut the number of newly diagnosed advanced-stage cancers — but i	0
"A new, detailed mammography exam catches more cancers while causing fewer false alarms, according to the company that sells it. The downside, some physicians say, is that it costs more and delivers twice as much radiation as traditional mammograms.  Tomosynthesis, or three-dimensional mammography, has been available in the U.S. since February from Hologic Inc., Bedford, Mass. In just a few months, radiologists say they are finding cancers they would have missed with the standard exam.  Others, though, urge caution. ""We really have to wait for the scientific evidence,"" says Barbara Monsees, who heads the American College of Radiology's breast-imaging commission, adding that the technology looks ""promising.""  Many digital mammogram centers are increasingly offering the option of paying a supplement out of pocket for a 3-D image. Standard mammograms miss 5% to 15% of tumors, in part because small ones can be hidden behind tissue. We discuss with Robert Cascella, CEO of Hologic, which manufactures a 3-D mammography machine. Photo: Hologic.  A study of some 25,000 women, now under way by an international team of researchers and partially funded by Hologic, is examining whether 3-D mammography finds more cancers. Preliminary results, presented at a scientific meeting in November, showed a 47% increase in cancer detection, but no conclusion can be drawn until the full results are published in a peer-reviewed journal, says Dr. Monsees.  The American Cancer Society recommends women get annual mammograms starting at 40 years old. A 3-D mammography machine is similar those used for standard 2-D mammography, but instead of taking just top and side pictures of each breast, the X-ray arm of a 3-D machine moves in an arc and collects detailed data used to create 50 or 60 razor-thin slices for each view. The 3-D scans show what breast tissue looks like at various depths.  Radiologists say they can now see tumors that would have been obscured by surrounding tissue. ""I think we're going to find more cancers at an earlier stage"" says Liane Philpotts, chief of breast imaging at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Conn., adding that one recent tumor, difficult to see on a standard exam, ""jumped right out at us"" on a 3-D scan.  The benefit is particularly noticeable in women with dense breasts, in which tumors can be hard to see, but the 3-D exam produces better results in all women, she says.  The new exam will likely save lives by finding cancers earlier and give women ""more options,"" such as skipping chemotherapy or getting a lighter dose, says Laurie Margolies, director of Breast Imaging at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. Dr. Margolies has briefly consulted for Hologic but has no continuing relationship with the company.  In addition to finding more tumors, early experience shows the 3-D exam may reduce anxiety-producing ""recalls,"" in which women are told to return for a diagnostic work-up after the mammogram looks unclear or concerning; recalls are mostly false alarms. In a 7,529-woman study at Yale University, the recall rate of women screened with 3-D and 2-D mammography combined was 6.6%, compared with 11.1% for 2-D alone.  The full exam typically includes a standard 2-D view as well as a 3-D one and has a patient under compression for a total of about 48 seconds, compared with 20 for a standard exam, Hologic says. Insurance often doesn't cover the 3-D portion so doctors say you often need to pay about $50 out of pocket. (The 2-D exam is done in part to aid in comparing results with earlier scans, Hologic says.)  The combination exam delivers 8.8 milligray of radiation per exam, around double what is given during a standard exam on Hologic 2-D machines, the company says. The double radiation dose could potentially cause cancer in 1 in 1,000 women who get 3-D mammography annually from age 40 until 80 instead of the standard exam, according to the Food and Drug Administration.  The more-detailed exam will save lives overall over the 2-D scan if at least 3% more cancers are detected, which appears likely from preliminary data, says Peter Soltani, senior vice president of breast health at Hologic. He adds that small amounts of radiation from mammography have never been proven to cause cancer.  Hologic has applied to the FDA for approval to market a technology that would synthesize a 2-D image from detail taken in the 3-D sweep and which physicians say would significantly lower the radiation because you'd only have to take one set of images instead of two. General Electric Co. is also applying to the FDA for permission to market a 3-D mammography machine; the company declined to say when it expects a decision.  —Email aches@wsj.com"	0
"An estimated 25 million to 45 million Americans suffer from irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS, a gastrointestinal condition that can cause miserable symptoms. Making it worse for many patients, there hasn't been a conclusive test to diagnose what's wrong with them. Without proof of a physical cause, some doctors considered IBS a psychological disorder.  But that could finally change with the introduction of two simple new blood tests for spotting the disease. Dr. Mark Pimentel of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles developed the tests.  ""We now have a test to say, you have a disease,"" Pimentel told CBS News. ""Having a test like this shortens the time of suffering, it shortens the time of investigation and accelerates getting the patient directly to treatment.""  New tests for common gastrointestinal disorder  The tests, which measure antibodies in the blood, were based on research suggesting that IBS may develop after infection from a bacterial toxin found in food poisoning. Researchers believe the toxin triggers the immune system to attack a person's intestinal tract long after the toxin is gone.  Irina Obenauer was diagnosed with IBS years ago after suffering from diarrhea and bloating, but it took doctors a long time to rule out other possible diagnoses first.  ""There's always kind of a 'trend of the week' that you had to go and get tested for and rule out, and at the end of the day you don't feel better,"" she said.  She got the new blood test to confirm her diagnosis, and when it came back positive, she said she felt a sense of relief knowing IBS wasn't all in her head.  ""I'm not saying the symptoms went away,"" she said, but she ""started to feel more whole.""  CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook, who is also a practicing internist and gastroenterologist, points out that the test is not perfect. While a positive test result is highly suggestive of IBS, only 44 percent of patients with IBS tested positive, meaning that many people who test negative could in fact still have the condition."	1
(Reuters Health) - Getting too little sleep during the week can increase some risk factors for diabetes, but sleeping late on weekends might help improve the picture, a small U.S. study suggests.  Researchers conducted a sleep experiment with 19 healthy young men and found just four nights of sleep deprivation were linked to changes in their blood suggesting their bodies weren’t handling sugar as well as usual.  But then, when they let the men get extra sleep for the next two nights, their blood tests returned to normal, countering the effect of the short-term sleep deprivation.  “It gives us some hope that if there is no way to extend sleep during the week, people should try very hard to protect their sleep when they do get an opportunity to sleep in and sleep as much as possible to pay back the sleep debt,” said lead study author Josaine Broussard of the University of Colorado Boulder.  The study doesn’t prove sleeping late every weekend can counter the ill effects of insufficient rest every other night of the week, Broussard cautioned.  And it doesn’t prove that catching up on sleep will prevent diabetes.  “We don’t know if people can recover if the behavior is repeated every week,” Broussard added by email. “It is likely though that if any group of people suffer from sleep loss, getting extra sleep will be beneficial.”  To assess the impact of sleep on diabetes risk, Broussard and colleagues focused on what’s known as insulin sensitivity, or the body’s ability to use the hormone insulin to regulate blood sugar. Impaired insulin sensitivity is one risk factor for type 2 diabetes, which is associated with age and obesity and happens when the body can’t properly convert blood sugar into energy.  The researchers did two brief sleep experiments. On one occasion, the volunteers were permitted just 4.5 hours of rest for four nights, followed by two evenings of extended sleep that amounted to 9.7 hours on average. On another occasion, the same men were allowed to sleep 8.5 hours for four nights.  After the four nights of sleep deprivation, the volunteers’ insulin sensitivity had fallen by 23 percent and their bodies had started to produce extra insulin. But when researchers checked again after two nights of extended rest, the men’s insulin sensitivity, and the amount of insulin their bodies produced, had returned to normal, mirroring what was seen during the portion of the experiment when the volunteers consistently got a good nights’ rest.  The volunteers were given a calorie-controlled diet to limit the potential for their food and drink choices to influence the outcomes. In the real world, when people don’t get enough sleep they tend to overeat, which may limit how much results from this lab experiment might happen in reality, the authors note in a report scheduled for publication in the journal Diabetes Care.  “The results from the present study are unlikely to be fully reflective of what may occur in persons who are older, overweight or obese, or have other potent risk factors for diabetes,” said James Gangwisch, a researcher at Columbia University who wasn’t involved in the study.  Chronically sleep-deprived people are more likely to develop other health problems, though, ranging from obesity to high blood pressure to cognitive deficits, the study authors point out.  “By catching up on sleep on the weekends, people are reducing average extent and severity of the effects of sleep deprivation,” Gangwisch added by email. “Ideally, we would all get sufficient sleep on a nightly basis.”  SOURCE: bit.ly/1DDtd9j Diabetes Care, released January 18, 2016.	0
Morning sickness can be one of the most miserable parts of pregnancy -- or, at least, so I am told. Unfortunately, new research reported Wednesday suggests that there is little women can do other than grin and bear it, since there appear to be no effective treatments.  The pharmaceutical industry once weighed in on the issue heavily, with the result being the introduction of the now-notorious thalidomide, which caused severe birth defects in a large number of infants. That episode led to increased requirements for safety screening of drugs before they are marketed and led to the still-prevalent consensus that it is generally not safe for women to take drugs during pregnancy, especially in the first trimester, when morning sickness is at its worst. That has led many women to try alternative treatments, including sugar solutions, ginger, vitamin B6, acupressure and acupuncture. Unfortunately, there is little evidence that any of them are effective, Dr. Anne Matthews of the School of Nursing at Ireland’s Dublin City University reported Wednesday in the Cochrane Library, a prestigious source of research on the effectiveness of medical treatments.  As many as 85% of pregnant women experience nausea, and half of those endure actual vomiting. The cause is unknown, but researchers suspect hormonal imbalances. About 1 in 200 suffer so severely that they cannot keep any food or liquids down, a condition known as hyperemesis gravidarum. It requires medical treatment and can cause blood clots and damage to the infant. On the plus side, a 2007 study found that women who suffer morning sickness are less likely to develop breast cancer.  Matthews and her colleagues reviewed 27 clinical trials involving 4,041 pregnant women who were as much as 20 weeks pregnant. In six studies of acupuncture and two of acupressure -- in which pressure is applied to acupuncture sites rather than needles -- they found no benefit. One study of acustimulation, in which a small electric current is applied through the needles, found some benefit over three weeks. There was also very little evidence to support the benefits of ginger (which actually made many women sick), vitamin B6, antihistamines and anti-vomiting drugs. The anti-vomiting drugs induced sleepiness in recipients.  Advertisement  “A number of the studies we looked at appeared to show benefits, but in general the results were inconsistent and it was difficult to draw firm conclusions about any one treatment in particular,” Matthews said in a statement. “We were also unable to obtain much information about whether these treatments are actually making a difference in women’s quality of life.”  Your best bet, according to most experts: Get plenty of rest, drink a little at a time but often to prevent dehydration, and eat small servings of bland food such as toast and crackers. Also, avoid strong smells; eating food cold rather than hot can minimize odors that cause nausea.  -- Thomas H. Maugh II / Los Angeles Times	1
Nov. 22, 2010 -- Exercising to piano music may help improve balance and prevent falls among the elderly.  A new study shows older men and women who participated in a piano-music-based exercise program were less likely to suffer a fall than those who didn't. Those who exercised to piano music also showed improvements in balance and the manner or style of walking.  “Each year, one-third of the population 65 years and older experiences at least one fall, and half of those fall repeatedly,” write researcher Andrea Trombetti, MD, of University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine of Geneva, Switzerland, and colleagues in the Archives of Internal Medicine. “Exercise can counteract key risk factors for falls, such as poor balance, and consequently reduce risk of falling in elderly community-dwelling individuals.”  Researchers say a large proportion of falls in elderly people occur while walking, so improving gait and balance can have a major impact on fall prevention.	1
"Breast cancer patients taking the drug tamoxifen can cut their chances of having the disease come back or kill them if they stay on the pills for 10 years instead of five years as doctors recommend now, a major study finds.  The results could change treatment, especially for younger women. The findings are a surprise because earlier research suggested that taking the hormone-blocking drug for longer than five years didn't help and might even be harmful.  In the new study, researchers found that women who took tamoxifen for 10 years lowered their risk of a recurrence by 25 percent and of dying of breast cancer by 29 percent compared to those who took the pills for just five years.  In absolute terms, continuing on tamoxifen kept three additional women out of every 100 from dying of breast cancer within five to 14 years from when their disease was diagnosed. When added to the benefit from the first five years of use, a decade of tamoxifen can cut breast cancer mortality in half during the second decade after diagnosis, researchers estimate.  Some women balk at taking a preventive drug for so long, but for those at high risk of a recurrence, ""this will be a convincer that they should continue,"" said Dr. Peter Ravdin, director of the breast cancer program at the UT Health Science Center in San Antonio.  He reviewed results of the study, which was being presented Wednesday at a breast cancer conference in San Antonio and published by the British medical journal Lancet.  ""The result of this trial will have a major, immediate impact on premenopausal women,"" Ravdin said.  About 50,000 of the roughly 230,000 new cases of breast cancer in the United States each year occur in women before menopause. Most breast cancers are fueled by estrogen, and hormone blockers are known to cut the risk of recurrence in such cases.  Tamoxifen long was the top choice, but newer drugs called aromatase inhibitors—sold as Arimidex, Femara, Aromasin and in generic form—do the job with less risk of causing uterine cancer and other problems.  But the newer drugs don't work well before menopause. Even some women past menopause choose tamoxifen over the newer drugs, which cost more and have different side effects such as joint pain, bone loss and sexual problems.  The new study aimed to see whether over a very long time, longer treatment with tamoxifen could help.  Dr. Christina Davies of the University of Oxford in England and other researchers assigned 6,846 women who already had taken tamoxifen for five years to either stay on it or take dummy pills for another five years.  Researchers saw little difference in the groups five to nine years after diagnosis. But beyond that time, 15 percent of women who had stopped taking tamoxifen after five years had died of breast cancer versus 12 percent of those who took it for 10 years. Cancer had returned in 25 percent of women on the shorter treatment versus 21 percent of those treated longer.  Tamoxifen had some troubling side effects: Longer use nearly doubled the risk of endometrial cancer. But it rarely proved fatal, and there was no increased risk among premenopausal women in the study—the very group tamoxifen helps most.  ""Overall the benefits of extended tamoxifen seemed to outweigh the risks substantially,"" Dr. Trevor Powles of the Cancer Centre London wrote in an editorial published with the study.  The study was sponsored by cancer research organizations in Britain and Europe, the United States Army, and AstraZeneca PLC, which makes Nolvadex, a brand of tamoxifen, which also is sold as a generic for 10 to 50 cents a day. Brand-name versions of the newer hormone blockers, aromatase inhibitors, are $300 or more per month, but generics are available for much less.  The results pose a quandary for breast cancer patients past menopause and those who become menopausal because of their treatment—the vast majority of cases. Previous studies found that starting on one of the newer hormone blockers led to fewer relapses than initial treatment with tamoxifen did.  Another study found that switching to one of the new drugs after five years of tamoxifen cut the risk of breast cancer recurrence nearly in half—more than what was seen in the new study of 10 years of tamoxifen.  ""For postmenopausal women, the data still remain much stronger at this point for a switch to an aromatase inhibitor,"" said that study's leader, Dr. Paul Goss of Massachusetts General Hospital. He has been a paid speaker for a company that makes one of those drugs.  Women in his study have not been followed long enough to see whether switching cuts deaths from breast cancer, as 10 years of tamoxifen did. Results are expected in about a year.  The cancer conference is sponsored by the American Association for Cancer Research, Baylor College of Medicine and the UT Health Science Center.  ———  Marilynn Marchione can be followed at url"	0
June 30, 2010 -- A drug used in Europe as emergency contraception may also treat painful uterine fibroids, researchers say.  Their study was presented at the 26th annual meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Rome, Italy.  As many as 80% of all women have uterine fibroids (noncancerous growths in the uterus), according to the nonprofit National Uterine Fibroids Foundation. Fibroids may cause severe abdominal pain, heavy bleeding, and interfere with fertility in some women. Surgery is often the only way to treat painful, bleeding fibroids, but surgery too can sometimes compromise fertility.  Enter EllaOne, a member of a new class of drugs called selective progesterone receptor modulators. As of now, EllaOne is used in Europe as a morning-after pill because it blocks the effects of key hormones -- namely progesterone -- involved in ovulation. It is effective for up to five days after unprotected sex. Although EllaOne is not available in the U.S., an FDA advisory panel recently voted that it should be. The new drug is manufactured by HRA Pharma, a European pharmaceutical company, which provided funding for the new study. The hormone progesterone also feeds uterine fibroids, so blocking its effects may help treat painful fibroids.	1
"Giving babies and toddlers antibiotics when doctors are certain they have ear infections can help speed up their recovery, supporting current treatment guidelines for children between the ages of 6 months and 23 months.  However, antibiotics do come with significant side effects including diarrhea, rashes, yeast infections and vomiting. Overuse of drugs also contributes to antibiotic resistance, so careful selection of who should take antibiotics is necessary according to 2 studies published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.  According to one of the studies, ear infection, or acute otitis media, is the most frequently diagnosed illness in children in the United States, and most children with these ear infections are routinely given antibiotics.  But just 2 months ago, a new study confirmed practice guidelines from 2004, which recommend that children older than 2 with a confirmed diagnosis of an acute ear infection do not need to be given antibiotics because the drugs do not significantly speed up recovery.  The foundation for the ""watchful waiting"" treatment recommendation instead of taking drugs is based on this and previous studies that did not have very many children under age 2 in the clinical trials. This made concluding that the same treatment works in the youngest age group very difficult.  These 2 new studies were designed to provide the research to fill the gap, and clarify treatment recommendations for babies and toddlers. The children in these latest trials had their ear infections confirmed by experts (otoscopists). Researchers found that the youngsters who received a placebo did not recover as quickly as those getting the amoxicillin-clavulanate, an antibiotic that has been shown to be effective for earaches.  However the differences were not huge. In the United States study, 80% of the children on antibiotics felt better on the seventh day of treatment; 74% of the children taking a placebo also felt better on the seventh day.  Dr. Jerome Klein, a pediatric infectious disease specialist from Boston University's Medical School, says in an accompanying editorial that these two studies resolve the controversy over giving antibiotics versus watchful waiting in kids with confirmed ear infections.  ""More young children with a certain diagnosis of acute otitis media recover more quickly when they are treated with an appropriate antimicrobial agent,"" Klein wrote.  Dr. Richard Rosenfeld, who is a professor and chairman of otolaryngology at SUNY Downstate and Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn, New York, has been charged with reviewing the 2004 American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines for treating ear infections. He, too, has been eagerly awaiting the results of these 2 studies.  One of the strengths of both studies, Rosenfeld said, is that the researchers took the time to make a solid diagnosis. Only children who really had ear infections were included in the trials. But Rosenfeld doesn't see the results as black and white as Klein.  ""Medicine is about gray zones and balancing the risks and benefits,"" Rosenfeld says. ""Parents and doctors need to understand what the benefits and what the downside of treatments are.""  ""If you received a placebo and you have a 74% chance of having symptoms go away or improvement [of illness]"" – compared with the 80% in the antibiotic group ... ""as a parent, how impressed are you about a 6% difference?"" In treatment outcomes for pain, there was no difference, he notes.  In both studies, children taking the real drugs had more side effects. The study authors caution about the overuse of these drugs and the risk of antibiotic resistance. The Finnish noted that limiting use of antibiotics may reduce the development of drug-resistant bacteria and increase the chance the future use of antibiotic will be effective.  Rosenfeld says it's never wrong to prescribe an antibiotic for a well-diagnosed ear infection. ""If the child has high fever, severe ear pain, the child is really miserable, has a fever or draining from the ear or double ear infection and is under 2 years old, then prescribing antibiotic is probably the right thing to do.""  But waiting to take the antibiotic isn't a bad idea either. He says he frequently writes a prescription for parents but tells them to hold off from filling it for 3 days. If the child still has symptoms 3 days later, then they should get the antibiotic and start giving it to their child. If you do that, 2 out of 3 parents don't fill out the prescription.""  Which is why he says what to do is still not clear-cut. He also points out that if antibiotics don't relieve a child's pain, pain medications will.  Rosenfeld believes these latest studies reinforce an important message: ""It's an opportunity for a conversation with your pediatrician."" Parents need to weigh the benefits of what antibiotics can do in terms of killing the bacteria (if the ear infection is caused by a bacteria and not a virus) and the side effects their child ma"	0
"En Español  By Steven Reinberg  HealthDay Reporter  MONDAY, July 9, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- A daily drink combining several nutrients appears to help people with early Alzheimer's disease improve their memory, a new study suggests.  As Alzheimer's progresses, patients lose their memory as synapses (connections between brain cells) deteriorate, according to background information included in the study. The new drink, called Souvenaid, may actually stimulate the growth of new synapses, said the drink's inventor, Massachusetts Institute of Technology scientist Dr. Richard Wurtman.  But more research is needed before the drink could be made available to the public. And, even then, consumers should exercise caution, said William Thies, vice president for medical and scientific affairs at the Alzheimer's Association.  Nutricia, a division of Dannon, sponsored the study. MIT has a patent on Souvenaid, and Nutricia has the exclusive license on the patent.  ""Existing data now suggests that it may be possible to receive something that will sustain cognition in people with Alzheimer's disease with a limited concern about side effects,"" Wurtman said.  Previous experiments in animals showed that giving them the three compounds included in the drink increased the production of synapses improving brain function, he said.  For the new study, nearly 260 early Alzheimer's patients in Europe drank either Souvenaid or a placebo for six months.  During the first three months of the study, patients in both groups showed improved memory. After that, however, patients taking the placebo had a decline in memory. In contrast, patients taking Souvenaid continued to show improved memory on tests used to assess Alzheimer's patients.  Whether Souvenaid will slow the progression of Alzheimer's isn't known. There is, however, a longer trial going on that might answer that question, Wurtman said. ""I don't think it has any effect on the fundamental diseases process, but we'll see,"" he said.  The report was published in the July 10 online edition of the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.  The drink combines three ingredients: choline, uridine and omega-3 fatty acids.  Choline is a B vitamin found in meats, nuts and eggs, and omega-3 fatty acids are found in fish, eggs, flaxseed and meat from grass-fed animals. Uridine, which is produced by the liver and kidneys, is also found in some foods as a part of RNA, which helps make protein in the body.  These nutrients, along with other proteins, are essential for making brain-cell membranes that form synapses. To be effective, all three compounds must be given together, the researchers said.  Nearly all patients drank the nutrient cocktail consistently throughout the study, and there were no serious side effects, the researchers reported.  To show the drink's effect on the brain, patients underwent electroencephalography (EEG) throughout the trial. During the study, the brains of those taking the drink shifted from patterns of dementia to more normal ones, the researchers found.  Since EEG patterns reflect the activity of synapses, this result suggests that synaptic function increased with treatment, the researchers said.  An earlier study found that patients with more advanced Alzheimer's did not benefit from Souvenaid, most likely because brains cells had already been lost so new synapses couldn't develop, Wurtman said.  There are as yet no plans to market Souvenaid, so the cost hasn't been established, company spokesman William Green said.  ""Souvenaid is a test product in development, which is still undergoing clinical trials,"" Green said. ""No plans for the introduction of Souvenaid to the market -- either in Europe or the U.S. -- have been confirmed. It is probable that any introduction would take place first in Europe.""  An ongoing study will evaluate the product over two years. If it appears to have a positive effect, then it may be something that could benefit patients even before definitive symptoms of Alzheimer's appear, Wurtman said.  Thies, of the Alzheimer's Association, is very cautious about the benefits of Souvenaid.  ""Medical foods do not have a requirement for FDA premarket approval, but they do have a requirement for having a scientific foundation and some evidence of efficacy,"" he said. ""But they don't have the kind of data we would find for a medication.""  That makes it difficult to make a clear-cut statement about the value of the product, he said.  ""There isn't a clear diet that prevents you from getting Alzheimer's disease or improves your memory,"" Thies said.  In addition, medical foods for Alzheimer's most likely won't be covered by insurance, he said.  ""You are making a judgment without the protections you have when dealing with a medication,"" Thies said. ""You're going to be making a decision using your own funds and we would advise anybody to make sure they understand what the product offers and make sure they understand what it's going to cost.""

"By Amy Norton  HealthDay Reporter  THURSDAY, May 2, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- An implanted device that monitors brain activity may offer a way to predict seizures in people with uncontrolled epilepsy, a small pilot study suggests.  The findings, reported online May 2 in the journal Lancet Neurology, are based on only 15 patients, and the device worked far better in some than others. But experts said the results are promising, and should prompt further studies.  ""We just wanted to see if this is feasible, and this study shows that it is,"" said lead researcher Dr. Mark Cook, of the University of Melbourne and St. Vincent's Hospital in Australia.  The prospect of being able to predict seizures is ""very exciting,"" he said, in part because it's the uncertainty of the disorder that can dim people's quality of life.  If people know a seizure is coming, Cook said, they can avoid driving or swimming that day, for example. They might also be able to adjust their medication use.  Epilepsy is a neurological disorder in which the brain's normal electrical activity is temporarily disrupted, leading to a seizure. Seizures can be obvious, causing unconsciousness or convulsions, but often they trigger subtler changes in a person's perceptions or behavior -- like a short staring spell, confusion or an altered sense of taste or smell.  Epilepsy is usually managed with medication, but for 30 percent to 40 percent of people with the condition, drugs don't keep seizures at bay. The new study included 15 people who were having at least two to 12 ""disabling"" seizures a month that were resistant to drug therapy.  Cook's team implanted each patient with the experimental device, which consists of electrodes placed between the skull and the brain, plus wires that run to a unit implanted under the skin of the chest.  That unit wirelessly sends data to a hand-held device that flashes a red warning light if there is a ""high likelihood"" of an impending seizure. (A white light signals a ""moderate"" likelihood, while a blue light means the odds are low.)  For the first four months, the devices collected data on patients' seizures without actually flashing warnings. For 11 of the 15 patients, the implants seemed capable of correctly predicting a high risk of seizure at least 65 percent of the time. Those patients went on to the next four-month phase, where the devices were activated to give warnings.  Over those four months, the implants worked fairly well for eight patients -- correctly giving the high-risk warning anywhere from 56 percent to 100 percent of the time.  There are plenty of questions left, said Dr. Ashesh Mehta, director of epilepsy surgery at the North Shore-LIJ Comprehensive Epilepsy Care Center in Great Neck, N.Y.  ""This study is an important first step,"" said Mehta, who was not involved in the research. ""The next step would be to implant these in a larger sample of patients. And you need to see which groups of patients might be good candidates for this.""  Mehta said someone who has seizures only once in a while might not get enough benefit to outweigh the downsides of false alarms, for example. And someone who has many seizures each month might get little added information from the warning system, he said.  It may be the people who fall in the middle -- who have disabling seizures at unpredictable intervals -- who would stand to benefit the most, he said.  But any benefits need to be weighed against the risks. Besides false alarms and unnecessary anxiety, the implant itself can cause problems. In this study, three patients had serious complications, including one with an infection and one whose chest device moved and caused her pain. Two patients ultimately had the implants removed.  Still, Mehta agreed that the technology could prove helpful to some people with epilepsy. If they know a seizure is coming, they might take an extra dose of their medication, for example.  An implanted device like this could also give patients and their doctors more information about their epilepsy, he added. In this study, the implants revealed that most patients were suffering more seizures than they thought; one patient who reported 11 a month was actually having more than 100.  In real life, Mehta said, it can be hard to know if you're feeling bad because of side effects from epilepsy medication or because you're having a lot of seizures. A device like this could help sort that out.  But what's still needed is evidence that this device does improve the quality of patients' lives, Mehta said.  The study was funded by NeuroVista, the Seattle-based company developing the technology. Several of Cook's co-researchers work for the company.

"Bypass Surgery Edges Stents For Heart Treatment  The debate over coronary bypass surgery versus stenting goes back decades.  Studies have been inconclusive, but doctors and patients have voted with their feet in favor of the less-invasive procedure — clearing clogged arteries and propping them open with tiny scaffolds called stents.  U.S. doctors do at least two stenting procedures these days for every coronary bypass operation.  Now the biggest collection of cases so far comes out in favor of surgery on the all-important question of mortality. Four years after the procedure, patients over 65 who had coronary artery bypass surgeries (called CABG or ""cabbages"") were almost 20 percent less likely to die.  Put another way, 21 percent of stented patients had died after four years compared with 16 percent of surgery patients.  Is that a big difference? Well, the study's lead author tells Shots that it might be enough to ""tip the balance a little bit, but not overwhelmingly so.""  The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, which funded the study with new ""stimulus"" money from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, is more bullish on the implications.  ""We would hope a study as powerful as this one will inform decision-makers to rethink the direction they're going in,"" the NHLBI's Dr. Michael Lauer told Shots. He says it's been worrying that so many doctors have been opting for stenting over surgery.  Study author Dr. William Weintraub, chief of cardiology at Christiana Care Health System in Newark, Del., is presenting the data at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology in Chicago. The study also appears online in the New England Journal of Medicine.  It draws on data from more than 86,000 patients across the nation who underwent CABG operations and nearly 104,000 patients who had coronary stenting. They had blockages in either two or three coronary arteries but did not require emergency procedures.  Although the pro-surgery outcome is not a game-changer, Weintraub says it might cause some doctors and patients to consider surgery. And he says it supports those who now opt for CABGs.  ""It's a very big deal to recommend coronary surgery to patients,"" Weintraub says. ""I think doctors work very hard to weigh what's best for their patients. When doctors recommend surgery, these data suggest that that decision is a good one.""  But Dr. Laura Mauri says in an accompanying editorial that the new study can't settle any debates. Only studies that randomly assign comparable patients to surgery or stenting can do that. Mauri is an interventional cardiologist – i.e., a specialist who does coronary stenting – at Brigham and Women's Hospital inBoston.  Weintraub notes it's ""very difficult and expensive"" to do randomized studies on this question – and to make the comparison groups truly comparable. And while such a study is being done, the technology (especially stenting technology) changes. That can call into question the ultimate relevance of the findings.  So the new data may be the best that doctors and patients in this situation can expect for the foreseeable future."	0
"Each year, five million people have wisdom teeth removed, but it's up in the air whether all of those surgeries were necessary.  Wisdom teeth, also called the third molars, are four teeth that grow at the very back of each corner of the mouth. For most people, they start to grow in between ages 17 and 25. They're thought to crowd out other teeth or cause tooth decay, which is why many dentists and oral surgeons think it's better to just nip those problems in the bud and take them out as a preventative measure.  But there's a serious debate between dentists and oral surgeons: should they preemptively remove someone's wisdom teeth if the patient doesn't have any symptoms?  Simply put, there's no right answer. It comes down to what you, as a patient, want. Here's what you need to know to figure that out.  Dentists and oral surgeons are fighting over wisdom teeth  Dentists and oral surgeons agree across the board that there's cause to remove wisdom teeth if a patient is in pain or if there are signs of disease popping up, like tooth decay or infection. That's an obvious choice. But taking out wisdom teeth when there aren't any symptoms is where the professionals get into it.  Many dental professionals stick with a watch and wait approach with wisdom teeth to avoid surgery if possible. ""Many people don’t have adequate space in their jaw for the teeth to come into full position, but that alone isn’t justification of having them all removed,"" says Dr. Scott Tomar of University of North Carolina's School of Dentistry. Tomar says that as a dentist he feels the risks of complication, including infection and hitting nerves during surgery, outweigh any benefits of preventative removal.  In 2007, oral surgeon Dr. Jay Friedman called the preventative removals a public health hazard in the American Journal of Public Health. The American Public Health Association has sided with this argument since 2008, when it formally opposed the preventative removal of wisdom teeth. (The same thing happened with tonsils, which doctors no longer remove just to get rid of the chance of infection later on.)  Americans spend an estimated $3 billion a year having their wisdom teeth removed  Some doctors, though, still see preventative oral surgery as being two steps ahead of the problem. If you're going to need your wisdom teeth out eventually, why not have them removed when you're younger and are more likely to recover more easily? Some think of removing the wisdom teeth early on as a way to lessen the crowding of other teeth  ""You might not have symptoms now, but you can't assume it's gonna be that way for the rest of your life,"" says Dr. Ray White, an oral surgeon working at University of North Carolina. Rather than let the teeth cause problems later on, many oral surgeons remove them.  But a 2012 Cochrane review of randomized clinical trials found there's no evidence that removing wisdom teeth will prevent or reduce crowding of other teeth down the line. And a different Cochrane review found that watching and waiting can ""may reduce the number of surgical procedures by 60 percent or more.  The question comes down to which side of the fence medical professionals fall on  It's worth noting that oral surgeons make a good chunk of their paychecks by removing wisdom teeth, so there is a financial incentive involved.  ""Are there people gaming the system? Sure. You don't get paid much for not doing anything,"" White says. ""But I'd hope we can get past that.""  The American Association of Oral and Maxillofacial surgeons says, ""There is no pat answer, cookbook recipe, or flow chart that is universally accepted regarding the decision making process"" in these cases. So the question comes down to which side of the fence medical professionals fall on, and what works best for their patients.  The risks and benefits of removing your wisdom teeth  There's a chance that if you opt not to have your wisdom teeth taken out, they might be fine for the rest of your life.  There's also a chance that they'll need to come out later. If that's the case, you can't always plan for it. Opting to have them removed gives patients time to plan around the procedure, which leaves people out of commission for about three days.  But inconvenience isn't the only risk. ""The risk for complications increases as people get older, and the duration of disability after the operation gets longer as people get older,"" says oral surgeon Dr. Thomas Dodson.  In some cases, the extraction can be more painful if you wait, Dodson says. That's because the tooth is easier to remove if its roots aren't fully developed.  The common risks related to the surgery include poor wound healing, infection, pain, and uncontrolled bleeding. Nerve injury, in rare cases of wisdom teeth removal, can leave people with permanent numbness around the face and mouth, according to the APHA.  Americans spend billions each year on wisdom teeth  Americans spend an estimated $3 billion a year having 10 million wisdom"	0
"Like many autistic children, Julian Brown has trouble reading emotions in people's faces, one of the biggest challenges for people with the neurological disorder.  Now the 10-year-old San Jose boy is getting help from ""autism glass"" — an experimental device that records and analyzes faces in real time and alerts him to the emotions they're expressing.  The facial recognition software was developed at Stanford University and runs on Google Glass, a computerized headset with a front-facing camera and a tiny display just above the right eye.  Julian is one of about 100 autistic children participating in a Stanford study to see if ""autism glass"" therapy can improve their ability to interpret facial expressions.  ""There's not a machine that can read your mind, but this helps with the emotions, you know, recognizing them,"" Julian said.  Julian wears the device each day for three 20-minute sessions when he interacts with family members face-to-face — talking, playing games, eating meals. The program runs on a smartphone, which records the sessions.  When the device's camera detects an emotion such as happiness or sadness, Julian sees the word ""happy"" or ""sad"" — or a corresponding ""emoji"" — flash on the glass display. The device also tests his ability to read facial expressions.  ""The autism glass program is meant to teach children with autism how to understand what a face is telling them. And we believe that when that happens they will become more socially engaged,"" said Dennis Wall, who directs the Stanford School of Medicine's Wall Lab, which is running the study.  Stanford student Catalin Voss and researcher Nick Haber developed the technology to track faces and detect emotions in a wide range of people and settings.  ""We had the idea of basically creating a behavioral aide that would recognize the expressions and faces for you and then give you social cues according to those,"" said Voss, who was partly inspired by a cousin who has autism.  Google provided about 35 Google Glass devices to Stanford, but otherwise hasn't been involved in the project. The Silicon Valley tech giant stopped producing the headset last year after it failed to gain traction, but the device found new life among medical researchers.  Brain Power, a Cambridge, Mass.-based startup, is also developing Google Glass-based applications to help children with autism improve their face-reading abilities and social skills.  Autism advocates are excited that researchers are developing technologies to help the estimated one in 68 American children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder.  ""Glass and wearable technology are the future. They're going to play a pivotal role in how we understand, manage and diagnose disorders like autism,"" said Robert Ring, chief science officer at Autism Speaks.  Currently, many autistic children learn to read facial expressions by working with therapists who use flashcards with faces expressing different emotions. The Stanford team hopes autism glass can provide a convenient, affordable therapy that families can do at home.  ""Kids with autism are not getting enough of the care that they need for as long as they need it, and we need to fix the problem,"" Wall said.  If the study shows positive results, the technology could become commercially available within a couple years, Wall said.  ""Anything that can help this population is very welcome and very important, but even the best technology will never be enough because we are dealing with a population with often very, very profound needs,"" said Jill Escher, president of Autism Society San Francisco Bay Area.  The study is still in its early stages, but Wall said participating children have shown gains in their face-reading abilities and family feedback has been encouraging.  ""It has helped our son who's using the Google Glasses connect with the family more,"" said Kristen Brown, Julian's mother. ""I think the glasses are a positive way to encourage a kid to look someone else in the face.""  Julian also gives the device positive reviews: ""I really think it would help autistic people a lot."""	0

Researchers out of the University of Leicester have developed a new asthma pill for the first time in 20 years, which they believe will significantly improve symptoms for those with severe asthma. The drug, known as Fevipiprant (QAW039), was shown to reduce asthma symptoms as well as inflammation, and it improved lung function and repaired airway linings.  The pill may be a “game changer for future treatment of asthma,” said Professor Chris Brightling, a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Senior Research Fellow at the University of Leicester, in a press release.  In the study, the researchers examined 61 participants who were divided into two groups: The first was given 225mg of the drug twice a day for 12 weeks, and the second group was given a placebo. By measuring the sputum eosinophil — the inflammation marker that shows how white blood cells increase during asthma attacks — the researchers were able to track the effects of the drug. When asthma symptoms occur, the number of white blood cells rises, and this measurement is used to define how severe the condition is. For people with asthma, a sputum eosinophil reading will typically be around five percent, compared to people without asthma, who have readings that are lower than one percent.  Pixabay, public domain  As the researchers tracked the participants over the course of 12 weeks, they found that those taking the drug saw a decrease in their sputum eosinophil reading from an average of 5.4 percent to 1.1 percent.  “A unique feature of this study was how it included measurements of symptoms, lung function using breathing tests, sampling of the airway wall and CT scans of the chest to give a complete picture of how the new drug works,” said Brightling in the press release. “Most treatments might improve some of these features of disease, but with Fevipiprant improvements were seen with all the types of tests. We already know that using treatments to target eosinophilic airway inflammation can substantially reduce asthma attacks.”  Ultimately, the researchers hope that the drug “could likewise help to stop preventable asthma attacks, reduce hospital admissions and improve day-to-day symptoms – making it a ‘game changer’ for future treatment,” said Brightling.

"En Español  By Kathleen Doheny  HealthDay Reporter  MONDAY, Nov. 16, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Breast-feeding a premature infant may help reduce the risk of a serious eye problem known as retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), new research suggests.  The researchers said that when babies were exclusively fed breast milk, the risk of any-stage ROP appeared to drop by about 75 percent. And the risk of severe ROP seemed to be reduced by 90 percent, the researchers added.  ""Human milk feeding potentially plays a strong role in protecting very preterm newborns from any-stage ROP and severe ROP,"" the international team of study authors wrote.  Retinopathy of prematurity causes blood vessels to grow in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue in the back of the eye. When the vessels grow, they can cause the retina to detach, destroying vision, according to the U.S. National Eye Institute.  For the study, researchers from China, Canada and the United Kingdom reanalyzed the results of five published studies on ROP. The studies included more than 2,200 preterm infants, comparing how often babies had been fed human milk or formula, and whether or not they developed ROP.  However, the new analysis only showed an association between breast milk and a reduced risk of ROP. It did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship due to the study's design.  Results of the study were published online Nov. 16 in Pediatrics.  Extremely preterm babies are most at risk of ROP. In the United States, 59 percent of babies born at 22 to 28 weeks have the disorder, said study researcher Dr. Chao Chen, a neonatologist at Children's Hospital of Fudan University, in Shanghai. He added that in China, a previous study showed the incidence of ROP was 50 percent in infants with a birth weight under 1,000 grams (2.2 pounds).  ROP ""has become a leading cause of childhood blindness in recent time,"" Chen said. ""In general, there are more ROP cases in developed countries, but more severe cases and higher rates of blindness in developing countries.""  The greater incidence of ROP is likely due to the increasing survival rate of very preterm babies in developed countries, according to Chen. In developing countries, preterm babies are less likely to survive. When they do, the screening and treatments are not as good, Chen said, so blindness may be more likely.  Babies in the studies had a range of gestational ages, from 26 to about 30 weeks. Their weights ranged from about 1.7 pounds to about 3 pounds. No information was given about how long the breast-feeding continued.  In re-evaluating the studies, Chen's team found that breast-feeding in any amount appeared to reduce the risk of ROP. And it appeared that the more breast milk, the better. Exclusive breast-feeding seemed to drop the odds of ROP by 75 percent compared to exclusive formula use. And any breast-feeding appeared to reduce the odds of the serious eye disease by 46 percent, the research showed.  How might human milk offer protection from the eye disorder? The antioxidants in human milk may help, Chen said. Human milk also has immune-protective properties, the researchers said. Breast-feeding also seems to help prevent two conditions known as sepsis and necrotizing enterocolitis that may require oxygen therapy, which has also been linked to a higher risk of ROP, the study authors said.  Dr. Adolfo Llanos, a neonatologist at Nicklaus Children's Hospital in Miami, who was not involved with the new study, said the ""quality of this analysis is very good. It's reassuring to see the benefit we see with breast milk.""  He said breast milk may help by reducing inflammation in the body. ""Preemies don't regulate inflammation in their bodies well,"" he said.  Llanos cautioned that the study looked only at a mother's own breast milk, not donor milk, which can be used when the biological mother doesn't have enough of her own breast milk.  The takeaway from this study, Llanos said, is to breast-feed as long as possible, if possible.  More information  To learn more about breast-feeding, visit American Academy of Pediatrics."	0
It’s common for people who suffer from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to also struggle with depression. Now, a small study published in the journal Gastroenterology suggests that taking a probiotic supplement may provide relief from both conditions.  The randomized, placebo-controlled trial shows a connection between probiotics and mood improvement in people with IBS and depression or anxiety, as well as changes in brain regions related to emotional processing. Most previous research on this topic has been on healthy people without mood disorders.  For the new research, scientists from McMaster University in Canada recruited 44 adults with IBS as well as mild to moderate anxiety or depression. They were followed for 10 weeks; half took a daily dose of the probiotic Bifidobacterium longum, and half took a placebo. The probiotics were manufactured and provided by Nestle, which also funded the study. (Nestle was not involved in collection, analysis or interpretation of study data.)  After six weeks, twice as many people who took the probiotic had decreased depression scores compared to those who took the placebo: 64% versus 32%. Results were similar after 10 weeks, as well. When people in the study were given functional MRI scans, the researchers found that improved depression scores were associated with changes in activity of several brain areas involved in mood regulation.  Health Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips. View Sample Sign Up Now  Those changes in brain activity “support the notion that this probiotic has anti-depressive properties,” the authors wrote in their paper. While their data did not show significant independent changes in anxiety, constipation, diarrhea or pain, people who took the probiotic did report improvements in overall symptoms of IBS and in quality of life.  One explanation for the improved mood in the group taking probiotics could be that because their physical symptoms feel better, their mood gets better too. That’s why Dr. Roger McIntyre, professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the University of Toronto, thinks the fMRI findings are the most interesting and important aspect of the new study: they signal that the probiotics may really be working on the brain itself.  MORE: You Asked: Should I Take Probiotics?  “We know that one part of the brain, the amygdala, tends to be red hot in people with depression, and it seemed to cool down with this intervention,” says McIntyre, who was not involved in the new research. “It provides more scientific believability that something in the brain, at a very biological level, seems to be affected by this probiotic.”  No serious side effects related to the probiotic were reported, suggesting that such a supplement could be a safe way to treat both stomach- and mood-related symptoms. Studies have looked at various types of probiotics for IBS patients, the authors wrote, and a recent review found that bifidobacteria seemed to work better for gastrointestinal symptoms than another common probiotic, lactobacilli.  Some experts believe that gut bacteria influence the brain (and vice versa) mainly through systemic inflammation. But in this study, the researchers found no difference in inflammatory markers between the probiotic and the placebo group. McIntyre points out that the bowel communicates with the brain through other pathways as well, including the metabolic and nervous systems.  MORE: Should I Eat Olives?  The study’s findings need to be confirmed in larger independent trials, and McIntyre says he wouldn’t yet recommend taking a probiotic for symptoms associated with mental disorders like depression or anxiety. (Study co-author Premysl Bercik, associate professor of medicine at McMaster University, says the formula used in the new research isn’t commercially available, anyway.) “The evidence at this point is promising,” says McIntyre, “but it is not sufficient to justify recommending to patients as a viable treatment strategy.”  But McIntyre says the results are encouraging. “They seem credible to me, and they might hint that there are other mechanisms, besides just inflammation, linking the GI tract to the brain,” he says.

"SATURDAY, Sept. 29, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Researchers say they've discovered a two-drug combination that delays treatment resistance in patients with advanced melanoma.  By targeting different points in the same growth-factor pathway, the kinase inhibitor drugs dabrafenib and trametinib postponed the development of drug resistance in patients with BRAF-positive metastatic melanoma, the study authors said.  Melanoma is the most serious, and often deadly, form of skin cancer. In about half of patients with melanoma that has spread, tumor growth is caused by genetic mutations that keep the BRAF protein -- part of the MAPK cell growth pathway -- constantly activated. Drugs that inhibit BRAF activity can rapidly stop and reverse tumor growth in about 90 percent of patients. But the response is temporary in most cases, and tumor growth resumes in six or seven months, the researchers explained.  Previous research suggested that this drug resistance develops because the MAPK pathway gets turned back on through activation of MEK, another protein that is part off the MAPK pathway.  ""We investigated this (drug) combination because of research we and others have conducted into the molecular underpinnings of resistance to BRAF inhibitor therapy,"" study lead author Dr. Keith Flaherty, of the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, said in a hospital news release.  The phase 1 and 2 study was sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline, which developed both drugs.  ""We found that adding the MEK inhibitor trametinib to BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib clearly delays the emergence of resistance. In fact, the combination was at least twice as effective as BRAF inhibition alone,"" he said.  One expert agreed that the results were encouraging.  ""This study addresses the problem of resistance to the mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK] pathway. This study combined dabrafenib [a selective BRAF inhibitor] and trametinib, [a selective MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor]. These drugs can be safely combined, and the survival was significantly improved without untoward side effects,"" said Dr. Michele Green, a dermatologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.  The study was conducted at 14 sites in the United States and Australia and included 162 patients who received different dose combinations of the drugs: two daily 150 milligram (mg) doses of dabrafenib plus one 2 mg dose of trametinib; the same dabrafenib dose with a 1 mg dose of trametinib; or treatment with dabrafenib alone.  Patients who received dabrafenib alone were able to receive the full-dose combination treatment if their cancer resumed progression.  Treatment with both combinations of dabrafenib and trametinib led to a four-month longer delay in drug resistance than treatment with dabrafenib alone. After one year of treatment, 41 percent of patients receiving the full-dose combination treatment had no progression of their melanoma, compared with 9 percent of those receiving dabrafenib alone.  Among patients receiving the combination treatment, the development of side effects such as skin rash and a less dangerous type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma was similar to that typically seen in patients taking only one of the drugs.  The study was scheduled for presentation Saturday at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Vienna and simultaneous publication in the New England Journal of Medicine.  The drug combination is now being tested in a larger phase 3 study, which is required for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval.

"CINCINNATI – Dawne Gardner-Davis almost skipped the free health screening for her son. The weather was rotten, an earlier appointment ran long — and 15-year-old Jordan was the picture of health.  Today, the Cincinnati mother of two is thankful she didn't. Doctors diagnosed Jordan with aortic root dilation, a potentially life-threatening heart defect. They advised the teen — who played six sports, his favorite being baseball — to quit competitive athletics for good.  For decades pediatricians and family physicians have sought a more effective way to identify young athletes at risk of dying while playing the sports they love.  Now, the Heart Institute at Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center is testing a new method. In the most complete test of its kind, the institute is using both an electrocardiogram and limited echocardiogram to see the rhythm and structure of the heart.  If proved effective, it could become the norm for identifying heart conditions that put one in 10,000 people at risk when doing top-level physical activities, researchers say.  Since the study began about a year ago, 500 local teens have been screened and 26 diagnosed with heart abnormalities. Twenty-two can continue in athletics, though they'll require lifelong monitoring.  Four young athletes, two girls and two boys, have been advised to quit sports altogether. Researchers hope to screen a total of 640 before they're done.  So far, their work is turning up a higher rate of heart abnormalities than expected.  Jordan was one of the more serious cases.  That day at his appointment, he, his mother and little sister Jaelynne sat astonished as doctors described a dangerously large root in Jordan's heart. Because of its size, it could rupture if stressed by too much physical activity. The effects could kill him.  Jordan took his doctor's advice and quit the sports he loved.  ""The saddest day for me had to be the day of (baseball) try-outs,"" Jordan says. ""I woke up, and I couldn't go to try-outs. After that I just started to cope.""  Precise diagnoses sought  Cases of high school athletes collapsing and dying on sports fields most often result from undiagnosed heart defects, says Dr. Jeffrey Towbin, co-director and head of clinical care at the Heart Institute. Victims often show no earlier symptoms, looking the picture of health.  Towbin asked two pediatric cardiologists — Dr. Jeff Anderson and Dr. Michelle Grenier —to take on the study that he'd wanted to do since joining the Heart Institute 3 and one-half years ago.  ""One of our goals is to advance the field … in areas either untouched or unappreciated as being important,"" Towbin says. ""These cases are obviously each a tragic event that occur in every city a few times a year.""  As high school sports begin this year, the caution takes on increased urgency.  Locally, swimmer Jose Cerda Navarro became unconscious during practice with his private swim club in October 2010. He died within the hour at the hospital, on this 18th birthday.  Cameron Batson, 18, died a few weeks before that, while playing a game of pick-up soccer. He had graduated that spring from high school in Covington.  In the United States, a doctor must approve participation in a school or competitive sports league. Approval is generally granted to teens with little to no family history of heart problems and a physical exam devoid of medical red flags.  Some years ago, Italy instituted a countrywide rule requiring competitive athletes to undergo an electrocardiogram, a test that records the electrical activity of the heart.  Fewer Italian athletes died after the testing began, but the tests also had a relatively high rate of falsely reporting medical problems. That led to unnecessary physical restrictions of athletes.  ""There's got to be a better way,"" Anderson said. ""That's what we set out to answer.""  Anderson and Grenier now say that adding a limited echocardiogram — a two-dimensional image of the heart — can offer a more precise diagnosis.  National estimates are that roughly 1% of people are born with potentially life-threatening heart defects. But the Children's Hospital study is showing more than twice that rate and a higher rate for more minor abnormalities as well, perhaps because of better technology, Grenier says.  ""I do think they're real numbers,"" she says of the study's findings so far. ""Are they normal variations? What (abnormality) is going to contribute to the overall health versus something that just looks funny? That's not entirely known.""  Grenier and her colleagues at the Heart Institute hope to continue this study — turn it into an ongoing program — so they may one day be able to answer those questions. In the meantime, screenings continue.  Making tests affordable, accessible  A key challenge now is making these tests affordable; most medical insurance plans won't cover them. Currently, an EKG and echocardiogram would cost parents a minimum of $2,500, Anderson says.  Simon's Fund, a non-profit organi"	1
"A cure for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a condition marked by progressive, debilitating cognitive decline that affects more than 5.4 million Americans, is the holy grail in disease research. One expert, Dr. Dale Bredesen, a professor at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and a professor at the Easton Laboratories for Neurodegenerative Disease Research at UCLA, thinks he might have found a way to reverse memory loss, a hallmark of the disease.  In a study published in the journal Aging, Bredesen and colleagues showed how 10 patients who were experiencing age-related memory decline showed brain scan improvements after following an approach called metabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration (MEND), a 36-point individualized regimen of diet, exercise, brain stimulation, sleep improvements, medication and vitamins and other specific protocols for five to 24 months.  For example, an MRI of one patient showed hippocampal volume at the 17th percentile for his age range prior to MEND. (The hippocampus is a brain area critical for learning and memory that shrinks in Alzheimer's patients.) After 10 months of following the prescribed protocol, his hippocampal volume increased to the 75th percentile.  The study noted that some of the patients who had to quit working as a result of their memory decline, were able to return to work after adopting MEND and participants who were struggling at their jobs reported an improvement in job performance.  ""Lives have been dramatically impacted,"" Bredesen told CBS News. ""I'm enthusiastic about that and continue to evolve the protocol.""  James E. Galvin, M.D., M.P.H., a professor of clinical biomedical science at FAU's Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine and a professor in the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing, who was not involved in the study, agreed that personalized approaches such as the MEND protocol are the types of approaches needed for this disease going forward. ""It's important to be excited about this approach,"" he told CBS News. However, Galvin cautioned, ""I'm not sure about the method.""  The MEND protocol, outlined in a 2014 study in the journal Aging, calls for interventions to treat conditions that could be associated with Alzheimer's such as inflammation, stress and diabetes. However, MEND also requires the use of supplements which are not well studied and do not require FDA approval.  ""Not all things from the approach have a lot of scientific support behind them,"" Galvin told CBS News.  But Bredesen believes that the only way to treat Alzheimer's is to treat all of the underlying problems, which may require intervention with supplements. ""Nutrition, exercise, sleep, stress reduction -- these are all critical pieces of this,"" he told CBS News. ""It's about optimizing biochemistry for your genetics, whatever it takes.""  But even if MEND is effective, the program is complex and difficult to follow. A Buck Institute press release on the study stated: ""None of the patients were able to stick to the entire protocol. The significant diet and lifestyle changes, and multiple pills required each day, were the two most common complaints.""  Bredesen said that to simplify the program, they are connecting patients with health coaches. ""We're trying to make it simpler, but we don't want to lose the efficacy,"" he said.  Bredesen noted, too, that the MEND protocol was suitable for patients in the early stages of Alzheimer's. One participant from the 2014 study, who had been diagnosed with late-stage Alzheimer's, did not show improvements with the protocol.  ""If you told me that your mother is 86 and living in a home, I would say that I'd want to treat you,"" he said. ""It's about prevention.""  Bredesen said that his team has a couple of larger trials planned to confirm or refute the results in the current study and to address key questions about how long results can be maintained and how late in the course of cognitive decline reversal is possible.  Galvin agrees that more research is necessary before any conclusive results can be reported. ""This is moving in the right direction,"" he told CBS News. ""These anecdotal case reports provide a nice point to start a discussion."""	1
Legend has it that King Tut was fond of pomegranates, and so were the ancient Persians. They surely enjoyed the fruit in its natural form — not processed into pomegranate extract pills.  These days, a number of companies sell pomegranate supplements and say the pills are a more convenient way to benefit from the fruit’s potent antioxidants. The most aggressive of these manufacturers is POM Wonderful, the company that also makes pomegranate-based juices, teas and snack bars. Each of its Pomx Pills provides the same “antioxidant power” as 8 ounces of Pom Wonderful 100% pomegranate juice without the 160 calories or 34 grams of sugar, the company says.  The appeal of antioxidants stems from studies showing that diets high in antioxidant-rich foods may be linked to a lower risk of cardiovascular disease, some types of cancer and other health problems. Antioxidants neutralize dangerous molecules called free radicals that, if left unchecked, can damage cells.  But claims that pomegranates, in particular, are good for the heart and prostate overstate the benefits of the fruit in any form, and especially in pills, says Dr. John Gordon Harold, a cardiologist at the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute in Los Angeles.  Advertisement  “If people want to take them, that’s fine, but it’s not based on any scientifically valid information,” says Harold, who is also a spokesman for the American Heart Assn. (The AHA does not take positions on individual commercial products.)  For close to a decade now, Pom Wonderful has touted what it claims are the fruit’s scientifically proven health benefits. The Los Angeles-based company has invested $34 million in pomegranate research, including studies on the fruit’s ability to improve cardiovascular and prostate health and erectile dysfunction.  That marketing approach captured the attention of the Federal Trade Commission. Last year, the agency filed a complaint against the company for “making false and unsubstantiated claims that their products will prevent or treat heart  disease, prostate cancer, and erectile dysfunction.”  Advertisement  Pom is fighting the charges.  “We disagree with the FTC and believe that the manner in which we have communicated the results of our scientific research is both truthful and appropriate,” the company said in a statement. “Our scientific research, which is world-class, shows that there are significant, healthful benefits associated with drinking pomegranate juice.”  The company also chastised the agency for targeting a “natural food product” instead of “focusing on manufactured and processed foods that make exaggerated health claims based on ingredients that have been added to the food in a laboratory. … Pomegranates are inherently healthy.”  Indeed, the pomegranate is “probably the most well-studied fruit we have,” says Dr. David Heber, director of the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition and a recipient of Pom funding.  Heber, who has conducted more than a dozen studies on pomegranates, says the fruit contains a powerful set of antioxidants, including compounds called anthocyanidins and ellagitannins. While some of these are found in other red-pigmented fruits and vegetables, including strawberries and red cabbage, other antioxidants, such as punicalagins, are found only in pomegranates and some rare herbs, he says.  It can be difficult to know precisely what parts of the fruit — and which specific antioxidants — are in commercial supplements because they’re not tightly regulated, Heber says. Pom crushes the entire pomegranate — skin, rind and all — to make its products, the company says.  Most of the evidence in favor of pomegranate’s health effects comes from laboratory and animal studies, and most of them focus on the juice, not the pills.  A review of studies on pomegranate juice published this year in Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice concluded that the beverage appeared to reduce blood pressure and slow the buildup of plaque in the arteries. But only five of the studies in the analysis were conducted in humans (the rest involved mice or test tubes), and they were small to boot. For instance, a widely cited 2001 study showing a 5% decline in blood pressure in people who drank 1.7 ounces of pomegranate juice daily for two weeks involved just 10 participants.  Advertisement  There’s less evidence to support the claim that pomegranate juice can prevent or treat prostate cancer. Animal research has been remarkably promising, says Hasan Mukhtar, a professor of cancer research at the University of Wisconsin Medical Science Center who has examined the juice in his own lab (with funding from Pom in some cases). But human research on the subject is limited to a single clinical trial, which lacked a proper placebo control, he says. (That 2006 trial, published in Clinical Cancer Research, showed that consuming 8 ounces of pomegranate juice daily slowed the increase of prostate specific antigen, a marker of prostate inflammation or cancer, in men with pr	0
If you’ve seen the television ad for the anti-germ spray MyClyns, you no doubt remember the pivotal scene: A mom and her two kids sit at a dinner table, the little boy coughs on his sister and mom heroically grabs the spray bottle of MyClyns. Against all expectations, she doesn’t spray the table or the air. Instead, she sprays her daughter. Directly in the face.  MyClyns is intended to kill germs that land on the face before they have a chance to cause illness, kind of like Lysol for the skin.  The spray looks like plain water, and for good reason. The only ingredients are water and sodium chloride, the chemical term for table salt. Before the water is bottled, it gets zapped with an electric charge. The result is “super oxidized” water that contains small amounts of hypochlorous acid and hypochlorite ions, two of the key components of chlorine bleach.  Users are instructed to use MyClyns “as quickly as possible” after being exposed to germs. According to the website, the spray should cover the “entire affected area” for best results.  Germ-ridden families aren’t the only intended market for MyClyns. Union Springs Pharmaceuticals, manufacturer of the product, also sells it to fire departments, police departments and ambulance crews. According to company President Joel Ivers, MyClyns is currently being used by first responders in more than 2,000 communities across the country.  A 0.2-ounce spray bottle, sold at major drugstores and many grocery stores, costs $9 or $10. This should be enough for about 60 sprays. The website says the solution will stay fresh for about three months after the first spray.  The claims  The TV ad says that MyClyns “kills 99% of germs and is safe for the eyes, nose and mouth where germs can enter your body.” Although the boy in the commercial appears to have a bad cold, Ivers clarifies that the spray isn’t intended to prevent or treat any specific disease. (The FDA has approved MyClyns as a device, not as a drug, so the company can’t claim to treat specific illnesses.)  The bottom line  MyClyns undoubtedly kills germs, says Dr. Marc Eckstein, professor of emergency medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of USC and medical director for the Los Angeles Fire Department. But at home or on the job, he says, a face-full of MyClyns may not be the best way to prevent illness.  “If someone coughs in your face at 60 miles per hour, decontaminating your face won’t help,” Eckstein says. Coughs and sneezes release germ-covered particles in the air, he explains, and people catch illnesses by inhaling the particles pretty much immediately. By the time that happens, it’s far too late for a face spray, he says.  Though it may not do much to prevent colds and flu, a spray of MyClyns could theoretically help protect first responders from blood-borne diseases such as hepatitis or perhaps even HIV, Eckstein adds. But he hasn’t ordered any for the L.A. Fire Department because “it could create a false sense of security.” Instead of depending on a spray to kill the germs from accidental blood splatters, first responders should wear masks and other protective gear, he says.  Several scientific studies have shown that MyClyns can kill a wide variety of germs. A 2005 study in Mexico found that the same solution in MyClyns (in this case, sold by Oculus Innovative Sciences Inc., under the brand name Microcyn) killed yeast as well as E. coli and staph bacteria in the laboratory. The study also found that it was effective against HIV and adenovirus, a type of respiratory virus, in the lab. The solution has also been shown to speed the healing of diabetic foot ulcers, presumably because it wiped out germs that could cause a sore to fester.  Since it kills so many germs without any harsh chemicals, MyClyns could be useful for cleaning doorknobs or countertops, says Dr. Jeffrey Kahn, chief of the division of pediatric infectious disease at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas.  But to Kahn’s mind, spraying a kid or anyone else in the face isn’t a very practical way to prevent illness, especially the flu, which often travels on hands. “It sounds like a sexy product, but simple hand-washing is likely to be more effective for preventing the flu than a one-time spray in the face,” he says.

"""Clinical enthusiasm for supplemental vitamin D has outpaced available evidence on its effectiveness,"" JoAnn E. Manson and Shari S. Bassuk of the Division of Preventive Medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston wrote last week in the journal's online version.  AD  AD  This practice isn't totally harmless. You should be consuming 600 international units daily if you're between the ages of 1 and 70, and 800 IU each day if you're 71 or older, according to the Institute of Medicine, the health arm of the National Academcy of Sciences. (For a chart with a little more detail, see here.) These amounts are enough for 97.5 percent of U.S. and Canadian residents, according to the IOM. (Sunlight stimulates production of vitamin D for people in sunnier climes.)  Go above 4,000 IUs, unless there's a specific reason that you need that amount, and you risk kidney stones, calcification of blood vessels and possibly the very cardiovascular disease you were seeking to prevent, Manson said in an interview.  So how did we get here? ""I think there's been a disconnect between the observational studies and the randomized clinical trials to date,"" Manson said. Over the past 15 years, those studies ""have looked promising, and very often they've been reported by the media as suggesting that vitamin D has these benefits. I think there's a general perception that if some is good, more is better. I think it's important to understand that more is not necessarily better.""  AD  AD  Manson is leading the most extensive clinical trial of vitamin D use ever, an examination of 25,875 people across the United States to determine whether vitamin D is helpful against cancer, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, depression, infection, autoimmune disorders and other conditions. The results are expected in late 2017 or early 2018.  In the meantime, how much vitamin D should you be consuming? The recommended dietary allowance works out to three or four servings each day of ""fortified"" foods such as milk, yogurt, soy beverages, orange juice or cereal, plus fatty fish twice a week, according to Manson's commentary.  She also called on physicians not to overscreen patients for vitamin D deficiencies, a practice that can lead to overprescribing it.  AD  ""Large trials of other widely used supplements have sometimes found benefits,"" Manson wrote, ""but in other cases--such as with high doses of beta carotene, vitamin E and selenium--have disproven some health claims for these supplements and identified health risks that may not have otherwise been detected.""

"Dear Julia: How well do flu shots actually work?  Just about every influential public health figure urges people to get their flu shots each fall as a necessary precaution during influenza season.  So over dinner, I asked a couple of respected evidence-based medicine researchers what they thought of the vaccine. I was taken aback by their response. They basically laughed at the idea that the flu shot was particularly effective.  This posed a conundrum. It seemed like there were two groups saying very different things. But after reviewing the research, I think I understand what's going on here. It's true that flu vaccines don't work spectacularly well, at least according to the best evidence we have (and most of the evidence on flu vaccines is of poor methodological quality). But the downsides to getting a vaccine are extremely minimal, and flu shots may still be helpful in reducing some illness and saving lives, which is why public health experts say you should get vaccinated anyway.  Why the flu vaccine isn't always effective  The flu vaccine has been our main strategy for warding off seasonal flu for more than 60 years. Seasonal influenza, which surfaces as a respiratory illness, is caused by influenza A and B viruses. The flu shot is designed to protect people against three or four strains of the A and B viruses that researchers believe will be most common that year, leading to the nasty fevers, headaches, coughs, and runny noses that make many people miserable in the fall and winter.  The challenge, however, is that the flu virus is highly unstable, mutating all the time. So this means drug companies can't just make one kind of vaccine that'll last a lifetime. Every year, public health agencies essentially make educated guesses on what strains and mutations will make the rounds. And that's not easy. In February, the World Health Organization offers a prediction — based on surveillance and laboratory and clinical studies — and then each country uses that prediction to approve vaccines in its jurisdiction. (In the US, the Food and Drug Administration makes that final call.) The potential for error here can dramatically alter the effectiveness of the flu shot in a given season. If vaccine makers prepare for one combination of viruses and different ones end up circulating widely, the vaccine won't work that well.  This may help explain why the evidence on the effectiveness of flu shots is relatively mixed. The Cochrane Collaboration, an independent nonprofit that reviews the evidence on medical questions, has conducted two major meta-analyses (looking at the results of lots of individual studies) on whether the shot prevents flu in healthy children and adults.  In kids, the highest-quality evidence — a randomized controlled trial — suggests the vaccine works well enough: On average, if you give six kids under the age of 6 a flu shot, you can expect to prevent one case of the flu. For children under age 2, the benefits are less clear; the evidence, the researchers found, was scant, and of the research that was available, it seemed the efficacy of the shot was similar to placebo.  In adults, however, the vaccine's effects are more modest. ""Depending on the season,"" explained Tom Jefferson, an author on these Cochrane reviews, ""you need to vaccinate anywhere between 33 and 100 people to avoid one set of symptoms."" In a good year, when the WHO guesses correctly and the flu shot matches the strains in circulation, you need to give 33 adults flu shots, on average, to prevent one case of illness. In a year when the WHO guesses badly, you need to vaccinate 100 people to prevent one flu case.  Jefferson pointed out that his Cochrane review on adults also found that flu vaccination rates have barely any effect on the number of sick days taken and no major impact on rates of hospitalization. So, yes, the flu vaccine can prevent illness, but it's hard to detect major effects on public health in the data.  On the other hand, the evidence suggests that there's no harm in getting a flu shot, either. The meta-analyses found no evidence of serious side effects beyond the odd case of soreness at the injection site.  That seems to be the same conclusion that other studies have drawn — the flu vaccine is modestly helpful, and doesn't hurt. In 2012 researchers analyzed 15 meta-analyses on the flu shot and concluded, ""Most influenza vaccines have been shown to confer some protection against naturally acquired infection and no evidence for major harms has emerged.""  One key caveat here is that the evidence, overall, is pretty poor quality. Most of these analyses rely overwhelmingly on observational studies, where researchers observe and gather data on people who take the flu shot compared with those who don't. Because these aren't experiments — ideally we'd have randomized controlled trials — they're more prone to bias and therefore less reliable.  In the case of the elderly, the situation is particularly troublesome. As this Lan"	0
As part of the trend in developing surgeries without external wounds, surgeons last week removed a woman's gallbladder through her mouth. The operation was performed as part of a clinical trial at UC San Diego School of Medicine.  The surgery is called NOTES -- which stands for natural orifice translumenal endoscopic surgery. The idea is to use the mouth or vagina as routes to parts of the body requiring surgery. In traditional laparoscopic -- or minimally invasive -- surgery, doctors make several small incisions through the abdominal wall and insert a tiny camera and tools to remove the gallbladder or appendix. That type of surgery is a big improvement upon the long, open incisions that patients used to require.  However, NOTES spares patients even the tiny abdominal incisions. Tools are passed down the mouth and through a hole created in the stomach. In the recent surgery, lead investigator Santiago Horgan made two tiny incisions (not requiring stitches) to pass a camera into the abdomen to increase visibility. However, the gallbladder was removed by way of the mouth.  The procedure was done as part of a study that will evaluate the safety and efficacy of NOTES compared with laparoscopy as well as the pain levels, cosmetic outcome, costs and other outcomes, Horgan said in a news release. Horgan is the director of UCSD's Center for the Future of Surgery. The hope is that natural orifice procedures will reduce the risk of infection and pain as well as abdominal scars. The center also performed the first oral appendix removal.  -- Shari Roan	1
"Sept. 14, 2011 -- Low doses of the muscle relaxant cyclobenzaprine, taken at bedtime, help people with fibromyalgia sleep better and feel less pain, according to a small study.  ""Bedtime treatment of fibromyalgia patients with low-dose cyclobenzaprine was safe and appears to be effective,"" says Seth Lederman, MD, president of TONIX Pharmaceuticals, which funded the study.  Fibromayalgia is a condition marked by fatigue, disturbed sleep, and pain. About 5 million Americans have fibromyalgia.  Cyclobenzaprine, marketed in higher doses by others as Amrix, Fexmid, and Flexeril, is already widely used ''off-label'' for patients with fibromyalgia, Lederman says. ""Off-label"" refers to the practice of prescribing medicines to treat conditions not been specifically approved by the FDA.  TONIX is developing a lower-dose version and improving the formula, Lederman says.  However, a rheumatologist not connected to the study does not expect the new drug to be a ''game-changer.""  The results of the study are published online in The Journal of Rheumatology."	0
"En Español  By Emily Willingham  HealthDay Reporter  TUESDAY, Aug. 25, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Needles beat pills for treating hot flashes in breast cancer survivors, according to a new trial that compared acupuncture, ""sham"" acupuncture, the medication gabapentin and a placebo pill.  Interestingly, sham acupuncture came in second place for effectiveness, the researchers said.  Furthermore, the effects of acupuncture were ""significant and enduring for hot flashes while gabapentin's effect only happened when a patient was taking the medication,"" said study first author Dr. Jun Mao, an associate professor of family medicine and community health at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.  The study was published Aug. 24 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.  Mao and his colleagues tested the treatments in 120 women who were breast cancer survivors. The women were enduring hot flashes at least twice a day.  Thirty women each received real acupuncture that also included a bit of an electric buzz or the inactive placebo pill, 32 women got sham acupuncture, and 28 women received gabapentin (Neurontin). The drug is typically used to treat seizures and nerve pain.  The women documented their hot flashes in diaries, noting frequency and severity, for 8 weeks of treatment, and then continued to keep track of their hot flashes up to 24 weeks total. The investigators used a hot flash score to see how much frequency and severity changed from when the study started to what the women reported at 8, 12 and 24 weeks.  Acupuncture had the greatest effect on overall hot flash scores at 8 weeks, when all interventions ended, followed by sham acupuncture and then gabapentin. At 24 weeks, 16 weeks after treatments ended, acupuncture was still associated with the greatest reduction in hot flashes. But even those who had sham acupuncture or placebo pills had steeper drops in hot flash scores at 24 weeks than those who took gabapentin.  ""The placebo effects for both acupuncture and drugs are quite intriguing, as they both seem to persist over time,"" Mao said. ""The magnitude of the placebo effect for acupuncture is bigger than for the drug.""  The results with the sham acupuncture, which bested gabapentin, suggest that ""there is more than a placebo effect with the sham acupuncture,"" said Dr. Gary Deng, interim chief of the integrative medicine service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. ""There is a component of behavior of doing a sham procedure, so it psychologically may trigger a different kind of reaction from patients versus taking the placebo pill.""  Deng pointed out that clinicians have come to realize that the placebo effect is very important in treatment. ""In fact, in clinical practice, every doctor uses it all of the time,"" he said. ""The so-called bedside manner or communication with patients -- all of these enhance the effect of the patients feeling they're getting something.""  No one is quite sure why placebos work for some people and not for others, said Deng. ""It's like psychotherapy,"" he added. ""Why does it work for some people and not others?"" He suggested that differences in anatomy and genetics might be possible explanations, but said ""there is a fertile field for further research.""  Some patients might wonder if acupuncture that's helpful for hot flashes among breast cancer patients might be helpful for the hot flashes associated with natural menopause. But Mao pointed out that hot flashes in breast cancer patients are more common, more severe and longer lasting than menopausal hot flashes.  However, Deng said that both might have similar causes related to lower estrogen levels. ""Breast cancer survivors have hot flashes because of hormonal repression,"" he said. Menopause also is linked to declining estrogen levels.  One big distinction between the two populations, though, is that breast cancer survivors do not have the option of hormone replacement therapy open to them because those hormones are linked to breast cancer. Some women undergoing natural menopause still might have that option available. For this reason, most studies of acupuncture for hot flashes have focused on breast cancer survivors, Deng explained.  But should a woman undergoing natural menopause try acupuncture for hot flashes?  ""For patients suffering symptoms, they can look for all kinds of possible solutions and are better off talking to their doctor to find out what's most appropriate for them,"" Deng said.

"WEDNESDAY, May 11, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- It may be possible to assess a man's fertility by checking his ""anogenital distance,"" the gap between his scrotum and anus, a new study suggests.  Previous studies in animals have shown that anogenital distance is an important measure of genital development and may be shorter in males with abnormal development and dysfunction of the testicles, the Baylor College of Medicine researchers explained.  Furthermore, a study from the University of Rochester, published in March in Environmental Health Perspectives, found that men with shorter anogenital spans had lower sperm counts, poorer quality sperm, lower sperm concentrations and lower motility.  In the new study, the Baylor group investigated whether anogenital distance differed in fertile and infertile men. They measured the scrotum-anus distance as well as the penis length of 117 infertile and 56 fertile men visiting an andrology clinic.  The infertile men had a significantly shorter anogenital distance and penis length than the fertile men, the study found.  Dr. Michael Eisenberg, a male reproductive medicine and surgery fellow in the Baylor urology department and the study's lead author, said the study has two main implications. ""First, this could represent a noninvasive way to test testicular function and reproductive potential in adult men,"" he said in a Baylor news release. ""And second, it suggests that gestational exposures and development may impact adult testicular function.""  Further research is needed to compare techniques for measuring anogenital distance and assess their accuracy, he and his colleagues said.  One expert who's done her own research in this area applauded the study.  ""This is an important paper showing, once again, that anogenital distance is a strong predictor of semen quality,"" said Shanna H. Swan, vice chair for research in the department of preventive medicine at Mount Sinai Children's Environmental Health Center, New York City.""This paper also provides new data on infertile men, who have shorter (less masculine) anogenital distance.""  Swan said that she and her colleagues published similar findings last month. ""Together the two studies make a strong case that this simple measure (the anogenital distance) reflects early genital development and predicts semen quality and fertility,"" she said.  But one urologist said the the finding is too preliminary to introduce into clinical practice, however.  ""We would all like a simple, noninvasive way to predict potential problems with fertility in men, but unfortunately, this one is not ready for prime time,"" said Dr. Elizabeth Kavaler, a urology specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""We have a long way to go before we can use anogenital distance as a determinant of future fertility in men.""  The study was published online May 11 in PLoS One.  More information  The American Academy of Family Physicians has more about male infertility."	0
Finally, the world might be catching a break when it comes to drug-resistant gonorrhea.  A new study suggests that a vaccine that protects against a strain of meningitis may also ward off the sexually transmitted infection.  The research, conducted in New Zealand, found that the gonorrhea rate among teens and young adults there who had received a meningitis B vaccine during an emergency campaign in the early 2000s was significantly lower than the rate seen in people of the same age who weren’t vaccinated.  advertisement  Researchers in Quebec say they saw the same phenomenon after a meningitis outbreak there, and previously published data from Cuba and Norway also hint of the vaccine’s unexpected benefit.  “It’s quite probably real,” said Helen Petousis-Harris, lead author of the New Zealand article and head of immunization research and vaccinology at the University of Auckland.  The findings are observational. Clinical trials will need to be conducted to see if the effect researchers have observed is actually due to the meningococcal B vaccine. But confirmation would be good news for the prevention and control of gonorrhea.  The last remaining drugs to cure this sexually transmitted infection are showing signs they may only have a few more years of usefulness left.  “While it is still very early days, these findings represent a positive step in the search for a vaccine against this common and distressing disease that is increasingly resistant to antibiotic treatment,” said Robin Gaitens, a spokeswoman for GSK, which owns the product that contains this meningitis component.  Why would a vaccine designed to protect against a strain of bacteria that causes meningitis also prevent gonorrhea infection? Some biology is useful here.  Meningitis is a condition — inflammation of the membranes that surround the brain and the spinal cord — that can be triggered by some viruses and several types of bacteria.  One of the latter is Neisseria meningitidis, sometimes known as meningococcal disease. It is the only form of bacterial meningitis that triggers epidemics.  Despite the fact that gonorrhea and meningitis are quite different from one another, the bacteria that cause Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis are actually related.  Meningococcal disease is rare but very dangerous. It can kill, and quickly. People who survive the infection can suffer permanent brain damage or may lose one or several limbs.

Privacy Policy Leave this field empty if you're human:  Because of the severity of the consequences, health officials often mount emergency vaccination campaigns in response to outbreaks of Neisseria meningitidis.  There are vaccines for several Neisseria meningitidis strains, but designing a vaccine to protect against the B strain was a particularly difficult nut to crack. As a consequence, the vaccine component that was made to protect against B targets a different part of the bacterium, Petousis-Harris said.  That may explain why the B vaccine appears to offer some protection against Neisseria gonorrhea. Meningococcal vaccines that protect against the other strains do not seem to have the same effect.  “A lot of these vaccines have been used widely globally,” Petousis-Harris said. “And what’s happened with gonorrhea? Nothing. Gonorrhea carries on its merry little way.”  New Zealand had a very bad meningococcal outbreak in the early 2000s caused by the B strain. A special vaccine that only protected against that strain was made; it was used between 2004 and 2008.  Petousis-Harris and her colleagues looked later to see if gonorrhea rates had changed after that meningococcal vaccination campaign. They found people who were vaccinated were 31 percent less likely to be infected with gonorrhea than those who hadn’t received the meningococcal B vaccine.  The study, published Monday in the Lancet, was funded by GSK and Auckland Uniservices, the commercialization arm of the University of Auckland.  The single-component vaccine used by New Zealand is no longer made. But the same component is one of several in the Bexsero vaccine, which was used in Quebec when the government decided to vaccinate against meningococcal B disease in a part of the province with a high relative rate of cases a few years ago.  Dr. Jean Longtin, head of the province’s public health laboratory, said he and some colleagues decided to look at whether the vaccination campaign was having an impact on gonorrhea rates in that area after reading about an early observation from Norway.  “In Quebec we saw the exact same effect as New Zealand,” said Longtin, who said his group is still analyzing its findings. “Gonorrhea rates have been going down in the vaccine group whereas in the non-vaccine group it’s following the rest of the province.”  It is not clear how long the protection — if it’s real — will actually last. But even a fe	0
(Reuters Health) - When a migraine strikes, patients might one day be able to make the experience less painful by using a smartphone-controlled device to deliver mild electric shocks to their arm, a company-funded experiment suggests.  The experimental gadget, Nerivio Migra, is a patch with a battery, electrodes and a computer chip that can wirelessly communicate with mobile devices. It’s designed to stimulate nerves under the skin in the arm and block pain signals from reaching the brain.  “All stimulation treatments given so far have been in the head,” said lead study author Dr. David Yarnitsky, an advisory board member for Theranica, the company developing the device.  “We worked on stimulation at a far away location, which makes the treatment more convenient and more discrete so people can use it even during working hours without anyone noticing,” Yarnitsky added by email.  The study involved 71 people with episodic migraines who had two to eight attacks a month and had not taken drugs to prevent the episodes for at least two months.  Participants were typically in their mid-to-late 40s and had been experiencing about five migraines a month. Most of them were female, and more than half of them reported experiencing what’s known as aura  Overall, participants had a total of 299 migraines during the study period.  Researchers asked participants to put the device on their upper arm as soon as possible after the start of a migraine and use it for 20 minutes. They were also asked not to take any medicines for migraines for two hours after the start of the episode.  For the experiment, researchers randomly programed the devices to give either placebo stimulation at a very low frequency or deliver one of four levels of active electrical stimulation treatment.  The four active treatment programs were set at a pulse rate of 80 to 120 Hertz (Hz) with pulse widths of 200, 150, 100 and 50. People feel less stimulation at lower pulse widths. At higher pulse widths than this device used, people might feel their muscles contract.  When researchers excluded the lowest pulse width, they found 64 percent of people in the other active treatment groups had at least a 50 percent pain reduction two hours after treatment, compared with 26 percent of people in the placebo group.  At the highest level of stimulation, 58 percent of the people who started out with moderate to severe pain reported little or no pain after treatment. So did 24 percent of people in the placebo group.  The timing of treatment also mattered.  People who started using the device within 20 minutes of the start of a migraine reported average pain reductions of 47 percent, compared to a 25 percent reduction in pain for people starting the device later.  Even though the study’s participants were not told whether they were assigned active or placebo treatment, one limitation of the experiment is that participants often stopped placebo treatments before the recommended 20-minute course of stimulation was done, the authors note in Neurology.  The technology known as transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS) that was tested in the current study has been examined in other devices for migraine pain for decades, said Dr. Jean Schoenen, a neurology researcher at the University of Liege in Belgium who wasn’t involved in the current experiment.  One shortcoming of the current study is that researchers didn’t examine how long the pain relief lasts beyond two hours, Schoenen said by email.  “Rapid and sustained relief is what patients want,” Schoenen added.  If the device works in larger trials and becomes widely available for migraine patients, it might offer an alternative for people who can’t tolerate migraine drugs or an option patients could try in addition to medication when they don’t get enough pain relief from drugs alone, Schoenen said.  “The percentage of attacks for which TENS is sufficient as sole treatment and allows sustained pain relief remains to be determined,” Schoenen cautioned.

"Bariatric Surgery Helps Teens With Severe Obesity Reduce Heart Disease Risk  Enlarge this image toggle caption Roos Koole/Getty Images Roos Koole/Getty Images  After three years, teens with severe obesity who underwent stomach reduction surgery to lose weight also significantly improved their heart health.  A study published Monday in Pediatrics shows that blood pressure, cholesterol, inflammation and insulin levels all improved, particularly among those who lost the most weight.  ""The potential impact of such risk reduction translates into a reduced likelihood of developing significant heart disease later in life, including atherosclerosis, heart failure and stroke,"" says study author Marc Michalsky, surgical director of the Center for Healthy Weight and Nutrition at Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, in an email. ""This study serves to reinforce the benefits of bariatric surgery as a safe and effective treatment strategy that should be considered sooner rather than later.""  Younger adolescents in the study showed bigger improvements in their cholesterol and inflammation levels than the older teens. Even participants who had normal-range blood pressure, triglycerides or cholesterol levels before surgery saw improved measures.  Nearly a third of all children and teens are overweight or obese in the U.S., and an estimated 4 to 7 percent have severe obesity. The greater a person's obesity, the greater their risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, Type 2 diabetes and organ damage.  The findings are important because many of the participants in this study likely already had some level of cardiac damage, such as thickened arteries or heart walls, says Geetha Raghuveer, a pediatric cardiologist at Children's Mercy Kansas City in Missouri who was not involved in the study.  ""If you have very high blood pressure or lipids [cholesterol] or diabetes, you do see cardiovascular changes even at a very young age,"" Raghuveer says. ""They may not be having a heart attack or stroke in their teens and 20s, but they're closer to having those in their 30s and 40s.""  Among 242 teens in the study, 161 of them underwent a Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure, 67 underwent a vertical sleeve gastrectomy and 14 received an adjustable gastric banding. The study authors had no part in which procedures the teens received. They collected data from the five participating medical centers for their observational study, and decisions about procedures depended on each center's clinical practices.  The teens, ages 15 to 18 when the study began, had a body mass index (BMI) between 34 and 88, with half over 51. Medical providers use BMI, the ratio of a person's weight to height, to estimate body fat. A BMI over 25 is considered overweight; over 30 is obese. The obesity classification with the highest risks of health problems is a BMI of 40 or higher.  The risk factors measured in the study included elevated blood pressure (above 120/80 mg/Hg), high cholesterol, high insulin levels in the blood and abnormally high levels of C-reactive protein, an indicator of inflammation in the body. The higher a person's insulin levels are, the more likely they are to have or develop insulin resistance, which can increase blood sugar levels and diabetes risk. High insulin levels may also contribute to increased blood pressure and increase the risk of atherosclerosis, when fat clogs the arteries.  Three years after surgery, teens who underwent a gastric bypass had a 27 percent drop in their BMI, similar to the 26 percent drop in those who had the sleeve gastrectomy. Those with the gastric band had an 8 percent drop in BMI.  Before surgery, only 3 percent of the teens had no cardiac risk factors at all, but three years later, just over half of them (52 percent) had no risk factors. Just 5 percent had all four cardiac risk factors before their surgeries, but none had all of them three years later. In fact, the majority of the participants — 83 percent — had only one or no risk factors three years after their surgeries. The proportion of participants with two or three risk factors also dropped substantially.  ""One of the surprises was that almost all patients benefited as a result of the surgery,"" says M. James Lenhard, the medical director of Christiana Care Health System's Diabetes & Metabolic Diseases Center in Wilmington, Del., who was not involved in the study. The average BMI three years after surgery was 39, still considered very obese, he says. ""And yet they still had significant improvements in cardiovascular risk factors,"" Lenhard says. ""The results were impressive.""  The study's biggest limitation is its very selective population. Most of the participants were female, most were white, and most received the gastric bypass. Children of color have the greatest risk of obesity, heart disease and Type 2 diabetes, but it's not clear whether they would see the same improvement with these procedures. Lenhard expects the ""odds are very good"" that "	0
"latimes.com/health/boostershots/la-heb-heart-failure-device-20101114,0,7655085.story  By Thomas H. Maugh II, Los Angeles Times  10:25 AM PST, November 14, 2010  Advertisement  An implanted combination cardiac resynchronization device and defibrillator reduces deaths from mild heart failure by 29% compared with a defibrillator alone, researchers reported Sunday. The report is the second one indicating that such combination devices, which are about the size of a cellphone, can save the lives of many of the 6 million Americans with heart failure, and many surgeons are already using them for that purpose. About 70% of heart failure patients have the milder form of the disease for which the new study was conducted. The condition requires frequent hospitalizations and costs the U.S. healthcare system an estimated $40 billion per year, according to the American Heart Assn.    Heart failure occurs when the muscles of the heart weaken and the ventricles fail to coordinate properly, or synchronize, reducing the ability of the organ to move blood throughout the body. In the most severe cases, patients become so weak that they are bedridden or suffer a variety of symptoms, such as shortness of breath, buildup of fluid in the lungs and other organs, confusion and fatigue. Patients with mild heart failure typically have few or no symptoms, but both groups have an equally high risk of atrial fibrillation (erratic heartbeats) or death.    A defibrillator applies a small electrical shock to the heart to halt the erratic heartbeats and restore normal function. Cardiac resynchronization therapy delivers a regular, small electrical signal to the heart to maintain regular beating, increasing the ejection fraction -- the amount of blood pushed into the cardiovascular system with each beat. The device has leads going to both ventricles to ensure that they are synchronized.    Such devices are approved in the United States for treating patients with severe heart failure.    Last year, U.S. researchers reported that a combination device manufactured by Boston Scientific reduced the death rate by 29% for patients with moderate heart failure in a study of about 1,800 patients. In September, the Food and Drug Administration gave the company approval to market the device for this indication.    In the new study, Dr. Anthony S. L. Tang of the Ottawa Heart Institute and his colleagues studied 1,798 mild heart failure patients at 24 centers in Canada, Australia, Europe and Turkey. About half were given an implantable defibrillator manufactured by Medtronic, Inc. of Minneapolis and half a combination device manufactured by the same company. The patients were followed for 40 months. Tang reported at a Chicago meeting of the American Heart Assn. and in a report published online in the New England Journal of Medicine that the team observed a 29% reduction in deaths in the patients treated with the combination device and a 27% reduction in deaths and heart failure-related hospitalizations. Fourteen patients had to be treated with the $35,000 device to prevent one death.    Complications were about twice as common with the combination device, primarily because connecting the leads to the ventricles takes longer and requires a higher skill level. The extra leads also increase the possibility of infections.    The study ""gives us reason for renewed enthusiasm about heart failure treatment,"" said Dr. Clyde Yancy of the Baylor University Medical Center, the immediate past president of the American Heart Assn. ""There has been a dearth of significant trials [in mild heart failure] for some time.... What's good is that when we compare this to the other two studies, we see some consistency of response.""    Dr. Alfred Bove, a professor emeritus at Temple Medical School and an immediate past president of the American College of Cardiology, noted that many surgeons are already installing the devices in patients with mild heart failure and only connecting the defibrillators, ""not hooking up the second function until it is needed."" The new study, he said, ""supports the idea that doing this works."""	0
"Walk A Little Faster To Get The Most Out of Your Exercise Time  Enlarge this image toggle caption iStockphoto iStockphoto  Some people — who are they? — have no problem fitting regular aerobic exercise into their lives. The rest of us want to know how much we have to exercise to see health benefits. Now we have some answers: You may want to go just a tad longer and harder than you'd thought.  Current government guidelines advise adults to get the equivalent of at least 2 1/2 hours of moderate-intensity aerobic exercise or 75 minutes of higher-intensity exercise every week, plus some strength training. In effect, those guidelines say there's no particular benefit from working out harder, other than saving time.  To find out if that's true, researchers at Queen's University in Ontario studied different combinations of exercise intensity and duration in a group of 300 sedentary adults with abdominal obesity. (That's generally defined as a waist circumference of more than 35 inches for women who aren't pregnant and more than 40 inches for men.) People with abdominal obesity are at higher risk of heart disease and early death than people with slimmer waistlines.  All the exercisers were told to work out under supervision five times per week for 24 weeks. One group worked out at low intensity, about 50 percent of maximum oxygen uptake (VO 2 max, a measure of cardiovascular fitness), for about 31 minutes per session — enough to burn 180 calories for women and 300 for men. That exercise prescription was about the same as in the government guidelines. The intensity was about equivalent to walking slowly, said study author Robert Ross, a kinesiologist at Queen's University.  Another group exercised at the same low intensity but almost twice as long — about 58 minutes on average, or five hours a week, until the women had burned 360 calories and the men 600.  And a third group exercised at a higher but still moderate intensity, 75 percent of VO 2 max, until they'd burned the same number of calories as the second group. That took about 40 minutes a day, or 3.3 hours a week. That intensity was equivalent to brisk walking for the previously sedentary participants, Ross told Shots. (Note that we're not talking about the all-out sprints of high-intensity interval training.)  A fourth group was told to do no exercise.  All the participants were told to keep a food diary and to eat a healthful diet but to keep their calorie intake constant. They also wore accelerometers to track their physical activity during the rest of the day, to make sure the more intense exercisers weren't compensating with more time on the sofa.  At the end of the study, members of all three exercise groups lost an average of about 2 inches from their waist circumference. There weren't differences between the three groups. The average exerciser also lost 5 to 6 percent of body weight.  ""The take-home message here is that if you're consuming a healthful diet and engaging with exercise consistent with the guidelines, you're going to see a benefit in your waistline and on the bathroom scale,"" said Ross. The results were published Monday in Annals of Internal Medicine.  But there was also a benefit from going just a bit faster: Only participants in the higher-intensity group saw an improvement in glucose tolerance, a risk factor for heart disease. (It's unclear whether the 9 percent improvement seen will be enough to cut their risk of heart disease, though.)  The result makes sense, since there's some previous evidence suggesting that higher-intensity exercise is tied to improving how the body processes sugar, said Neal Pire, an exercise physiologist who puts together medically based training programs at HNH Fitness in Oradell, N.J., a program of Holy Name Medical Center. Strength training can also improve glucose tolerance, which is why it's part of the government guidelines, he told Shots.  Cardiovascular fitness also improved in all three groups, but the lower-intensity exercisers who went longer did better than those who went shorter, and the higher-intensity group did better still.  Bottom line: All the exercisers improved, but the folks who did the best walked briskly for about 40 minutes five times a week. (Ross suggests you walk as if you're late for a bus.) ""It doesn't take a lot,"" said Ross. ""That's why our participants were so surprised. They didn't have to climb Mount Everest."""	0
"When words on a menu seem small and blurry and reading the newspaper becomes a struggle – these are often side effects of getting old.  Presbyopia, the natural aging process of the eye, generally starts around age 40 and worsens over time.  ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT  There is no cure for the condition, but many ophthalmologists say reading glasses, contact lenses or even surgery can help correct your vision.  But now, a new app called GlassesOff claims it can help you see better without any glasses or magnifying devices.  Dr. Christopher Starr, a GlassesOff consultant and associate professor of ophthalmology at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York, says the app improves the brain’s visual cortex, which processes the images we see.  “It actually strengthens those connections in that part of the brain to help us better be able to identify [and] process a blurry image in front of our eyes,"" Starr told FoxNews.com.  The app works by using different game-like exercises to “train” the brain to interpret blurry images accurately.  Users are asked to finish three 12-minute sessions per week for three months.  Some gaming sessions ask users to identify fuzzy designs called ""Gabor patterns"" that flash on screen. And in other tests the app asks users to decide whether the letter ""E"" is facing up, down, right or left.  “Your eye is sending your brain a blurry image, but because your brain has gone through this training, it’s capable of processing much lower quality images,” Starr said.  The company says the app is scientifically tested. In a small study published in Nature's Scientific Reports, 90 percent of participants gained the ability to read comfortably without glasses.  But not all experts are sold on the app’s training method.  “The proposed theory of explanation behind the GlassesOff technology seems to imply that the resolution of the captured image of the eye and its more central processing by the brain can be improved upon, with ‘learning’. The idea that these low level changes can translate into higher visual performance that is clinically meaningful to a patient is yet to be demonstrated in any randomized clinical trial,” Dr. Barrett Katz, a neuro-opthamologist at New York’s Montefiore Medical Center, told FoxNews.com  The app is free to download, but the basic 3-month program costs $25. The company suggests following their “Ongoing Vision Care program” in order to keep the benefits indefinitely. For the life-long option, you can subscribe for $9.99 a month or pay $59.99 for the year.  For more information go to GlassesOff.com."	0

"En Español  By Steven Reinberg  HealthDay Reporter  FRIDAY, Nov. 4, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Obese patients who swallowed balloon capsules that helped them eat less lost an average of 15 pounds, roughly two times more weight than patients who just dieted and exercised, researchers report.  The capsule was inflated with gas via a catheter when it reached the stomach. As many as three balloons were placed over three months, and all of the balloons were removed after six months. The balloons made patients feel full, the researchers explained.  In addition to the balloons, patients followed a moderate diet and behavior modification program. Whether the weight loss will last over the long term isn't known, said lead researcher Dr. Aurora Pryor, director of the Bariatric and Metabolic Weight Loss Center at Stony Brook University in New York.  The study lasted a year, but ""we don't know what happens after that,"" Pryor said.  ""If they are able to stick to their newfound lifestyle with their diet and exercise program, they could maintain their weight loss,"" she said. ""The long-term results are dependent on patients keeping their motivation to stay with their diet and exercise programs.""  The balloon treatment will be available starting in January, but the cost hasn't been announced, Pryor said. The device, called the Obalon Balloon System, was approved in September by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.  An advantage of the balloons is that patients have no downtime and can go back to work the same day, the researchers said.  ""There is no sedation or recovery time when the balloons are placed, but there is sedation when the balloons are removed, so you wouldn't want to go back to work after that,"" Pryor added.  Pryor believes balloons are a better option for patients who are candidates for weight loss surgery but don't want surgery. ""For people who want to lose some weight but don't feel they are heavy enough for surgery or they're afraid of surgery, this is a really good next step to help them jump start their weight loss,"" she suggested.  The findings were to be presented Friday at the annual meeting of the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery and the Obesity Society in New Orleans. Research presented at meeting is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.  One weight-loss expert expressed some doubts about the findings.  ""I still question the efficacy of balloons,"" said Dr. Mitchell Roslin, chief of obesity surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""While there is potentially easier insertion that does not require sedation, I still doubt after removal there will be weight loss,"" he said.  Roslin said patients who have other treatments that restrict their ability to eat -- such as bands and bypass operations that reduce the size of the stomach -- often regain lost weight over time. ""As time goes on, weight loss will be about lifestyle changes,"" he said.  The only argument for the balloon is that it starts the lifestyle changes, Roslin said. ""It may make it easier to become motivated,"" he said. ""But I believe that few will maintain weight loss two years after any balloon.""  For the study, Pryor and her colleagues randomly assigned nearly 400 obese patients to receive a real or sham device. All patients also had 25 minutes of lifestyle therapy every three weeks. After six months, patients with the Obalon balloons had them removed.  During the time patients had the balloons, and for six months after, the researchers monitored their weight loss. The investigators also followed those who had not received the balloon therapy.  People treated with the balloons lost an average of 7 percent of their weight, compared to less than 4 percent for those who received the sham device, the researchers found. Six months after the balloons were removed, nearly 90 percent maintained the weight loss they achieved during treatment, Pryor said.  As for side effects, one patient had a bleeding stomach ulcer while taking high doses of pain pills after a knee replacement. Most patients (91 percent) suffered from stomach cramps and nausea, which nearly 100 percent said were mild or moderate.  The results were also presented at a medical meeting in May.  One health and nutrition expert noted that a balloon does not equal a lifestyle change.  ""A gastric balloon may help with weight loss, but will do nothing to improve diet quality and overall health,"" said Dr. David Katz. He is director of the Yale-Griffin Prevention Research Center in Derby, Conn., and president of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine.  The role for such technology-based approaches to weight control should be a small one, he said.  ""Such devices may be alternatives to bariatric surgery in some cases. But they should not distract us from the far better solution at the population level: practices, programs and policies that make eating well and being active a cultural norm,"" Katz said.

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Tens of thousands of kids may benefit from cholesterol-lowering medication, but no one would know because screening guidelines exclude too many children, U.S. doctors said Monday.  In a report published in the journal Pediatrics, they call for screening of all children, expanding one set of current recommendations that target only those whose parents or grandparents have heart disease or high cholesterol. Another existing set of guidelines doesn’t call for screening in any children.  Screening all children would “identify a number of children who are of very significant risk of premature heart disease,” said Dr. William Neal of West Virginia University in Morgantown, who led the new study.  Neal said treating youth with cholesterol-lowering drugs, the so-called statins, would curb the risk that they went on to develop heart problems in middle age. Heart disease is the leading cause of death in the Western world.  Based on data from West Virginia, Neal and colleagues found that more than one percent of all fifth-graders had cholesterol levels that warranted drug treatment. But a third of those children didn’t have relatives with heart disease or high cholesterol, and so wouldn’t have been screened under the current guidelines, issued by the government’s National Cholesterol Education Program.  “I have gradually become convinced that universal screening in children is not only preferable, but necessary,” said Neal. He added that although universal screening would be expensive, it would save a lot of money later on if heart disease could be prevented.  But not all scientists agree that screening is a good idea. For example, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federal expert panel, currently doesn’t recommend routine cholesterol screening in any children.  “Unfortunately, there is no evidence that starting a ten-year-old on cholesterol-lowering drugs will prevent heart disease 40 years later,” said Dr. Michael L. LeFevre, a member of the task force.  He said statin treatment in children was still controversial, and that no long-term safety data existed.  The new study tapped into data from more than 20,000 children who had been screened at public schools in West Virginia over five years.  More than seven in 10 school kids had first-degree relatives with heart disease, and about one percent of those had “bad” cholesterol (LDL cholesterol) levels that might require drug treatment in addition to diet changes and exercise, according to the researchers.  Yet among the kids without heart disease in their family, the percentage of children who might benefit from treatment was closer to two percent than to one, meaning that family history didn’t seem to make a difference.  “It is therefore prudent to implement universal screening in the pediatric population independent of family history,” the researchers conclude.

"A Rubber Twist On Treating Tennis Elbow Pain  Enlarge this image toggle caption Maggie Starbard/NPR Maggie Starbard/NPR  Larry Holzman — avid mountain-biker, skier and guitarist in a band — plays hard. And he didn't want to give it all up due to a ""spot of pain"" in his elbow. ""This wasn't a traumatic injury,"" explains Holzman. It came on gradually and escalated from annoying to excruciating over the course of a couple months.  His physical therapist quickly diagnosed it as tennis elbow. Turns out, lots of people who develop tennis elbow haven't played the game in years. And some have never even picked up a racket.  ""If you're having pain on the elbow on the outside of your elbow when you grip a coffee mug or pick something up with your hands — that is almost always tennis elbow,"" says Barton Bishop, a physical therapist at Sport & Spine Rehab in Rockville, Md.  Pain from repetitive overuse of the tendons and muscle that run from the wrist to the elbow can come from all sorts of activities. It usually happens when people grip things too hard or too long.  VIDEO: Tennis Elbow Exercise Holzman's injured left elbow muscle strengthens as it lengthens and contracts in this eccentric wrist exercise.  In addition to tennis players, Bishop sees the injury in gardeners with their shovels and trowels; painters with brushes; and golfers with clubs. In Larry's case, it was a combination of all his hobbies: from squeezing the handlebars on his bike, to lifting weights and playing in a band.  ""Gripping guitars and base drums ... can really affect people's elbows,"" says Bishop.  When Holzman came to Sport & Spine for help, Bishop put him through a series of traditional treatments including ultrasound, strengthening and stretching exercises, cross-friction massage, heat and ice.  He also added a series of eccentric wrist exercises using a rubber bar called the Thera-Band FlexBar — ideal for the injured muscle in tennis elbow. The exercises enable the muscle to lengthen and contract simultaneously. And the FlexBar makes it simple to do this kind of stretch.  ""He's actually getting his muscle to work,"" says Bishop. ""It's a perfect exercise.""  Bishop says the benefit of the FlexBar, which costs between $16 and $33, over traditional hand weights is that it helps people strengthen without recreating the symptoms. He says weights can overwork the muscle and sometimes leads to more pain.  A study by researchers at the Nicholas Institute of Sports Medicine and Athletic Trauma, Lenox Hill Hospital in New York demonstrated this benefit. They found that adding the eccentric wrist extension exercises using the FlexBar was effective at improving strength and decreasing pain in patients with tennis elbow. (Performance Health Brands, maker of Thera-Band, provided the FlexBars for the study but did not fund it.)  Not all physical therapists are sold on the FlexBar. ""There's a variety of methods you can use to achieve the strengthening technique,"" says Jason Grandeo, a physical therapist at Body Dynamics, Inc. in Arlington, Va.  But he understands the appeal: The FlexBar is easy to use and you can do it at home."	0
"En Español  By Dennis Thompson  HealthDay Reporter  TUESDAY, Jan. 17, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Because of stringent tonsillectomy guidelines, some kids who could benefit from tonsil removal surgery aren't getting it, two new reviews suggest.  To qualify for the surgery, a child must have many recurring throat infections within a short span of time or severe sleep disturbances, said Dr. Sivakumar Chinnadurai, a co-author of the reviews.  An evaluation of current medical evidence suggests more kids would receive significant short-term improvement in their daily life if the guidelines were relaxed, said Chinnadurai, a pediatric otolaryngologist with Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.  Children experienced nearly half as many sore throats when they underwent a tonsillectomy, even if they didn't meet the guidelines, Chinnadurai and his colleagues found. The kids also missed fewer days of school and were less likely to need medical care.  However, this strong benefit only applies to the first couple of years following surgery, Chinnadurai said. By the third year, there was no clear benefit in terms of the number of throat infections. Also, there was limited research on long-term results.  ""The decision about whether those children should have tonsillectomy for that temporary benefit is really tied to what those children need or what they're suffering with,"" Chinnadurai said. Kids who miss a lot of school or need frequent trips to the doctor due to sore throats could benefit from the surgery, he said.  There's an even clearer benefit for kids whose sleep is disturbed due to inflamed tonsils, Chinnadurai said.  ""In a child with a diagnosis of sleep apnea, we can see a benefit in sleep-related quality of life,"" he said. The kids get better sleep, and thus exhibit better everyday behavior and pay more attention in school.  The medical approach to treating tonsil infections has evolved over recent decades.  Tonsillectomy is the third most common surgery performed on U.S. children, with 530,000 such procedures completed each year, according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck Surgery.  Thirty years ago, nine out of 10 tonsillectomies in children were performed to treat recurring throat infections. These days, the procedure is done 20 percent of the time for infections and 80 percent of the time for sleep problems, according to the academy.  Swollen tonsils can block the airway during sleep, causing breathing problems that range from simple snoring to obstructive sleep apnea, the researchers said in background notes.  Guidelines say a tonsillectomy to treat throat infections is justified if a child had seven or more sore throats during the previous year; five or more sore throats two years running, or three or more sore throats for three years in a row, according to the background notes.  The researchers decided to review whether the throat infection guidelines are too stringent, ruling out patients who potentially could benefit but don't meet the high threshold of recurring infections, Chinnadurai said.  There aren't strong guidelines regarding the use of tonsillectomy to treat sleep disorders, so the doctors reviewed the evidence to see whether the surgery outperformed so-called watchful waiting -- monitoring the situation.  The study results showed ""there may be new evidence that supports expanding the criteria and opening up the procedure to more individuals,"" said Dr. Alyssa Hackett, an otolaryngologist with the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai in New York City.  ""In the right child with the right indications, these are really wonderful procedures that can be life-changing for both the child and the family,"" said Hackett, who wasn't involved with the new research.  ""If you need your appendix out, you need your appendix out,"" Hackett said. ""But for the tonsils and adenoids, there are great quality-of-life benefits that are evident for the surgery, but no child has ever died because they haven't gone through the surgery."" (Adenoids, glands at the roof of the mouth, are often removed along with tonsils.)  Still, Chinnadurai and Hackett warned against automatically choosing the surgery for every sore throat.  About 3 percent of kids who undergo the procedure experience bleeding during the two-week recovery period, Hackett said.  ""Though a tonsillectomy is low-risk, it is not risk-free, and those risks need to be weighed against the benefits for each individual child,"" Chinnadurai said.  ""We're talking about a child who has significant sleep-related issues,"" Hackett said. ""We don't want people to say my child snores, they need to have their tonsils out. That's not what this study says at all.""  The two reports were published online Jan. 17 in the journal Pediatrics.

"En Español  By Amanda Gardner  HealthDay Reporter  WEDNESDAY, April 7, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Researchers may have found an easy way to detect lung cancer in its early or even pre-cancerous stages, as well as a way to reverse the start of the deadly disease with a readily available, over-the-counter drug.  ""It's incredibly, incredibly exciting,"" said Dr. Patrick Nana-Sinkam, a lung cancer expert with the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, who was not involved with the new study. ""This definitely has potential.""  The minimally invasive procedure involves using a small brush to collect a smattering of cells from the windpipe (a bronchoscopy), explained study co-author Andrea Bild, an assistant professor of pharmacology and toxicology at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.  Maybe one day, screening could be done using an even simpler nasal or sputum test, the researchers said.  Currently, there is no good way to detect lung cancer -- the number one cancer killer -- in its early stages when it's most treatable. By the time most lung cancers are diagnosed -- which usually involves an invasive examination of the lungs -- patients already have advanced malignancies. Only 15 percent of patients are still alive at five years, said Nana-Sinkam.  Cigarette smoking is responsible for 90 percent of all lung cancer cases in the United States.  Still, only 10 to 20 percent of smokers actually develop lung cancer, begging the question: Why do some smokers succumb to the disease and others don't.  Now genomics may have provided an answer.  Working on the theory that cigarettes harm not only the lungs but a ""field of injury"" extending to other areas of the respiratory tract, the study authors surmised that evidence of existing or soon-to-develop lung cancer might be available further up in the airway.  The researchers used so-called microarray genetic analysis to measure gene expression levels in the epithelial cells -- those cells lining the respiratory tract -- that they had captured with the bronchoscopy.  ""We were looking at the activity of genes in the cells that we obtained from the windpipe or airways of smokers at risk for lung cancer,"" said study senior author Dr. Avrum Spira, a critical care physician at Boston Medical Center and associate professor of medicine, pathology and bioinformatics at Boston University School of Medicine.  It turned out that gene activity in the PI3K pathway was ""off the chart"" in smokers with lung cancer versus those without the disease.  ""Obviously that's very exciting,"" Spira said. ""We have identified a marker for an early risk of developing lung cancer.""  And when treated with the compound myo-inositol, the gene pathway activity declined along with improvement in the troublesome lesions, the researcher noted.  ""This drug inhibits the pathway that's activated in smokers. The drug is a natural compound. You can get it in health-food stores,"" Spira said.  ""We're now in the midst of a large study to look at whether or not activity of this pathway can be used to pick those who could benefit from this as a treatment as opposed to just prevention,"" said Spira, who is a co-founder of Allegro Diagnostics Inc., a company that plans to market this biomarker.  The researchers also need to explore whether or not the PI3K pathway is active in non-smokers, as well as what other pathways might also trigger lung cancer.  The study findings were published in the April 7 issue of the journal Science Translational Medicine.  More information  The U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on lung cancer."	1
"A special type of CT scan can detect lung cancer early enough to save some lives, the National Cancer Institute announced Thursday - the first evidence that a screening test may help fight the top U.S. cancer killer.  At issue are controversial spiral CT scans, where a rotating scanner views the lungs at various angles to spot growths when they are about half the size that a standard chest X-ray can detect. Some previous studies have suggested that the earlier detection helps, while other research concluded it may do more harm than good by spotting too many benign growths.  The massive National Lung Screening Trial enrolled 53,000 current or former smokers to try to settle the debate. It found 20 percent fewer deaths from lung cancer among those screened with spiral CTs than among those given chest X-rays, the NCI said Thursday, a difference significant enough that it ended the study early.  The actual number of deaths averted was fairly modest - 354 died in the spiral CT group over the eight-year study period compared with 442 deaths among those who got chest X-rays.  The NCI said it is not clear that all smokers should get the scans, which are not risk-free.  The best advice for avoiding lung cancer remains to quit smoking, said NCI Director Dr. Harold Varmus.  Still, ""a validated approach that can reduce lung cancer mortality by even 20 percent has the potential to spare very significant numbers of people from the ravages of this disease,"" he said.  About 200,000 new lung cancers are diagnosed in the U.S. each year, and the disease kills about 159,000 people annually. It is most often diagnosed at advanced stages, and the average five-year survival rate is just 15 percent.  Many smokers already had sought out spiral CTs, even though the American Cancer Society hasn't recommended the test - citing a lack of clear evidence that they work - and most insurance doesn't cover the $300 to $400 cost.  The scans aren't risk-free: They frequently mistake scar tissue from an old infection or some other benign lump for cancer, leading to unnecessary biopsies or surgery that in turn can cause a collapsed lung, infection or other problems.  The NCI still is compiling rates of false alarms and other risks from the study.  Nor is it clear if the study results are applicable to all smokers. The trial enrolled people ages 55 to 74 who were or had been very heavy smokers and gave them one scan a year for three years.  While the spiral CTs emit less radiation than standard CT scans used to diagnose disease, researchers also will analyze whether the radiation exposures from three scans changes a smoker's lifetime risk of other radiation-related cancers. Letters being mailed to study participants advise them to discuss with their doctors whether they should have additional scans or not."	0
"WEDNESDAY, April 28, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- A new drug may be the first new treatment in 25 years for a common diabetes-linked eye condition called diabetic macular edema (DME), researchers report.  Lucentis (ranibizumab) was originally developed to treat age-related macular degeneration. But researchers say it can also improve vision in people with DME, a common form of diabetic retinopathy.  The study of 691 patients with DME found that 50 percent of those who received Lucentis eye injections, plus laser treatment if necessary, had substantial improvement in vision one year after treatment, compared with 28 percent of patients who received laser treatment alone. Results were similar after two years.  For 25 years, laser treatment has been the standard of care for DME, the main cause of vision loss in people with diabetes.  The study, published online in the journal Ophthalmology, was conducted by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research (DRCR) Network.  According to the U.S. National Eye Institute, DME occurs when fluid leaks into the center of the macula, the portion of the eye dedicated to sharp, straight-ahead vision. The condition is common in people with diabetic retinopathy, which affects up to 45 percent of people with diabetes.  The results of the new study ""appear to be applicable to most people who have DME in the center of the macula with some vision loss, whether the person has type 1 or type 2 diabetes, is old or young, or is a woman or a man,"" Dr. Neil M. Bressler, chair of the DRCR Network and chief of the retina division, Wilmer Eye Institute, at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said in a news release.  This is a ""seminal"" study,"" added Dr. George A. Williams, a board member of the American Academy of Ophthalmology and chair of the ophthalmology department at Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine.  ""First and most importantly, it provides patients an improved therapy for diabetic macular edema. Second, the DRCR Network study is the first multi-center, randomized clinical trial to show how ranibizumab and the laser work together to improve treatment,"" Williams said.  The American Academy of Ophthalmology will review the study findings and make recommendations on whether Lucentis plus laser treatment should be the preferred treatment for a large number of patients with DME.

"Tired? Depressed? Forgetting things? Who isn't these days?  Those are also symptoms of a deficiency of B12, a key nutrient needed to make red blood cells and DNA and keep the nervous system working right.  Vitamin B12 deficiency is officially considered rare, affecting about 1 in 1,000 Americans, according to a 2005 study. But the incidence rises with age, to about 15% of elderly people. The rate is also much higher among people who don't eat meat or dairy products, people with absorption problems, people taking acid-blocking medications and those with Type 2 diabetes who take the drug Metformin.  ""B12 deficiency is much more common than the textbooks and journal articles say it is,"" says Alan Pocinki, an internist in Washington D.C., who routinely tests his patients who fall into those categories. He also notes that since the Metformin connection was discovered only recently, some physicians aren't aware of it. ""They assume that if patients complain of numbness and tingling in the feet, it's a diabetes issue and not a B12 issue.""  Other symptoms of low B12 include anemia, depression, dementia, confusion, loss of appetite and balance problems. Long-term deficiency can bring severe anemia, nerve damage and neurological changes that may be irreversible.  Just three ounces of clams, breaded and fried, have about 570% of the daily allowance. Getty Images  Sometimes the symptoms are subtle. Internist Linda Assatourians, one of Dr. Pocinki's partners, says that a surprising number of her young female patients also have low levels of B12. Typically they are healthy and active, but they don't eat much meat and they have minor mood, memory or balance problems. ""When I supplement their B12, they feel better,"" Dr. Assatourians says. ""It's not a controlled study, but I see a lot of them.""  ""I was sort of tired, but I thought, 'It's winter and I'm doing too much,' "" says Jessica Riester, 27, editor of publications for a German-American think tank. Her B12 level was slightly over 200 picograms per milliliter (the normal range is considered 200 to 800 pg per ml). After several weeks of B12 injections, then 1,000 milligrams daily in pill form, her B12 is now over 600 pg per ml and she says she feels better. ""My color is better and the shadows under my eyes are gone,"" she says.  Indeed, several studies have shown that some symptoms of B12 deficiency, particularly early problems with cognitive function, can be apparent even when patients' blood levels are still in the normal range.  How Much Recommended Dietary Allowances for vitamin B12 by age: 0-6 months: 400 nanograms  6-12 months: 500 ng  1-3 years: 900 ng  4-8 years: 1.2 micrograms  9-13 years: 1.8 mcg  14 years and older: 2.4 mcg  Pregnant women: 2.6 mcg  Nursing mothers: 2.8 mcg Source: National Academy of Sciences, 1998  Still, vitamin B12 isn't a miracle pick-me-up, a performance enhancer, a weight-loss aid or a quick way to sober up after a long night of drinking, as some celebrities and Internet marketers claim. For people who aren't deficient, ""there's no evidence whatsoever that these injections are useful to pep you up,"" says Irwin H. Rosenberg, a professor and former dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition at Tufts University. Taking too much B12 is unlikely to be harmful, he adds; the excess is simply excreted.  B12 is one of the newest of the human vitamins, identified in 1948. It originates in bacteria, yeast and microbes in soil. Plants can't store it, so people get their B12 almost exclusively from meat, liver, poultry, fish and dairy products. Adults need just 2.4 micrograms a day, the amount in three ounces of beef, and can generally store it in fat tissue for several years. Dr. Pocinki speculates that some of his very lean patients are B12 deficient because they don't have much fat to store it in.  Some people have trouble absorbing B12 in the first place. Stomach acid is needed to release it from food particles. People who have used acid-blocking medications, particularly proton-pump inhibitors, for years may not have enough. And many elderly people naturally stop making stomach acid, so B12 deficiencies are increasingly common as people age.  Boosting B12 B12 comes almost exclusively from meat, liver, poultry, fish and dairy products. Some breakfast cereals are also fortified with the vitamin.

The device, made of both synthetic and animal tissue, is driven by two miniature electric motors. Implanted in the patient’s chest after the diseased heart is removed, it uses information gleaned from sensors to mimic the activity of the natural organ. It is operated by a microcontroller and powered by electromagnetic induction through the skin or through a plug implanted behind the patient’s ear.  Carmat estimates its device will cost $176,000 to $226,000. When all expenses are considered, including hospital and surgical expenses, it says it will cost just over $315,000, about the same as a transplant.  Photo  The device was developed over 15 years by a team that included Alain F. Carpentier, the French surgeon-scientist who, along with Albert Starr, received the 2007 Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research. The Lasker Foundation, which is based in New York, praised their work in the development of artificial heart valves, saying they had “prolonged and enhanced the lives of millions of people with heart disease.”  In the November 2009 bulletin of the Académie Nationale de Médecine, Dr. Carpentier wrote that, instead of picking up from older models of artificial hearts built on animal research, the developers of the new device had sought to use the tools of the digital revolution, namely computer-assisted design, hemodynamic modeling, regulation algorithms and simulations.  The French company is not the first to make total artificial hearts, which are meant to completely replace damaged and diseased organs.

SynCardia, based in Tucson, currently makes the only approved temporary artificial heart, having continued development of the groundbreaking Jarvik-7, which Dr. William C. DeVries implanted in a retired dentist named Barney B. Clark in 1982. Its device, powered by a small air compressor that can be carried in a backpack, has been implanted in more than 800 patients as a bridge before transplant.  Abiomed, a company based in Danvers, Mass., makes a self-contained total artificial heart, the electrical-powered AbioCor. The United States Food and Drug Administration has designated the AbioCor as a “humanitarian use device,” meaning its use is restricted to people who are ineligible for transplants and would otherwise be facing imminent death.  Others are in development. In the United States, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, a unit of the National Institutes of Health, is supporting efforts by two separate groups, one led by Dr. O. H. Frazier of the Texas Heart Institute in Houston, the other by Dr. Leonard A. R. Golding of the Cleveland Clinic.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Another device is being developed by scientists at the Helmholtz-Institute for Biomedical Engineering at the University of Aachen in Germany.  “There’s definitely a major need for a permanent, total artificial heart,” Laman A. Gray Jr., the University of Louisville professor of surgery who implanted the first AbioCor heart in 2001, said.  Citing World Health Organization data that shows heart disease is the world’s leading cause of death, Mr. Conviti, the Carmat chief executive, estimated the potential market at “a minimum” of 100,000 patients a year in the United States and Europe. However, he said cost constraints meant it was unlikely that more than one-tenth of those patients would actually receive an artificial heart.	1
About 28 million Americans have sleep apnea, which causes repeated awakenings and pauses in breathing during the night, sometimes resulting in loud snoring and gasps for air. For decades, the standard treatment has been “continuous positive airway pressure.” A mask worn at night pushes air into the nasal passages, enabling easier breathing. C.P.A.P. reduces and in some cases completely prevents episodes of apnea.  Joseph A. Golish M.D.  But the mask is like something from a bad science fiction movie: big, bulky and obtrusive. Many patients simply refuse to wear it or rip it off while asleep. Studies show that about half of all people prescribed C.P.A.P. machines stop using them in one to three weeks.  “For a lot of people out there, the C.P.A.P. machine turns into a doorstop,” said Dr. Joseph Golish, the former chief of sleep medicine at the Cleveland Clinic and now a professor with the MetroHealth System in Cleveland. “C.P.A.P. is very effective in the sleep lab. But when people go home, there’s a good chance they won’t use it, and the success rate of an unused C.P.A.P. machine is absolutely zero.”  Now an alternative form of C.P.A.P. is gaining popularity: a patch that fits over the nostrils. Called Provent, the patch holds two small plugs, one for each nostril, that create just enough air pressure to keep the airways open at night. It is far less intrusive than the traditional C.P.A.P. machine. It is also more expensive, and it doesn’t work for every patient.  Approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2008, Provent has spread mostly by word of mouth. But it has caught on fast. Its manufacturer, Ventus Medical, says it has shipped one million of the devices in the past 12 months, up from a half million total in the two years prior. Doctors say it has given them a new weapon in the battle against sleep apnea, and many patients who struggled with C.P.A.P. call it a godsend.  Bob Bleck, who owns a computer networking firm in Ohio, struggled with poor sleep and chronic fatigue for decades. But it was only a year and a half ago that he finally went to a sleep clinic, prodded by his wife, who worried about his heavy snoring.  The diagnosis was severe sleep apnea. Tests showed that in a typical night, Mr. Bleck, 47, awoke or stopped breathing 42 times an hour.  His doctor prescribed a C.P.A.P. machine, and Mr. Bleck hated it.  “I had this constricted feeling,” he said. “It would be incorporated into these dreams where I was tied up, like in the movie ‘Alien.’ It was more difficult to sleep with that thing on than to just get through the night with the apnea.”  Mr. Bleck got rid of the machine after he discovered Provent. “After I started using it, I noticed a difference right away,” he said. “My symptoms subsided dramatically.”  Provent works like a traditional C.P.A.P. machine but is only a fraction of the size. When people with apnea fall asleep, their throat muscles collapse, constricting the airway and causing the body to fight for air. C.P.A.P. machines use mild air pressure to keep the airway from constricting.  Provent does too, but in a different way. The device contains two pinhole-size valves, one over each nostril. The valves let air in easily — most people breathe through their nostrils while asleep — but there is resistance as the user exhales. That resistance creates a backpressure in the airways, dilating the muscles that would otherwise collapse in the middle of the night. In the morning, the patch is removed; a new one is used every night.  Last year, in a large study of 250 apnea sufferers published in the medical journal Sleep and subsidized by Ventus, researchers found that those who used Provent devices over a three-month period saw their apnea episodes fall sharply, compared with people who were given a sham, or placebo, device. A follow-up study tracked people over the course of a year and had similar results.  But not everyone finds that Provent alleviates their apnea. In interviews, sleep specialists said that a third or more of patients do not end up using it.  “It works like a champ in some people and doesn’t work on other people,” said Dr. Nancy Appelblatt, an ear, nose and throat surgeon in Sacramento who has prescribed it to about 100 patients. “All sleep apnea is not created equal.”  Some people, for example, breathe through the mouth at night, not the nostrils. In those people, Provent typically doesn’t work. Nor will it work very well in someone who has severe nasal allergies and has a blocked nose at night, said one of the leaders of the Provent studies, Dr. Meir H. Kryger, a professor at Yale Medical School and founder of the National Sleep Foundation.  Unlike C.P.A.P., Provent is not covered by Medicare and most major insurers, though some doctors say they expect that will change in the near future. In the meantime, a 30-day supply of the patches costs $65 to $80.  Dr. Lee A. Surkin, a cardiologist and sleep medicine specialist in Greenville, N.C., said patients typicall	1
“It’s promising that we can see an effect from a single dose,” says researcher Leah Coles, PhD, a research fellow at the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne, Australia. “That effect might be even greater over the long term if they are drinking it day upon day.”  Researchers say that drop may seem small, but on a public health level a reduction like that would equate to a 10% reduction in deaths due to heart disease .  The study shows that within hours of drinking it, beet juice lowered systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) by an average of 4-5 points among a small group of healthy men .  Dec. 14, 2012 -- Drinking a glass of beet juice may have an immediate impact on lowering blood pressure , according to a new study.  Beetroot Benefits  Previous studies have shown that beet juice, also known as beetroot juice, can lower blood pressure in a laboratory setting. But researchers say this is the first study to look at the effects of adding beet juice to a heathy person’s diet without making any other diet or lifestyle changes.  The results appear in Nutrition Journal.  In the study, 15 men and 15 women drank either 17.6 ounces of a beet juice beverage consisting of about three-fourths beet juice and one-fourth apple juice, or a placebo juice. They were then monitored for 24 hours. The same procedure was repeated two weeks later, with those who drank the placebo on the first round receiving beetroot juice on the second.  Among both men and women, the results showed a trend to lower systolic blood pressure six hours after drinking the beet juice.  But when researchers limited their analysis to men only, they found a significant reduction of about 4.7 points among those who drank the beetroot juice.  Previous studies have also suggested that beetroot’s blood-pressure-lowering effects may not be as strong in women.  In this case, Coles says it may be partially explained by the fact that the women in the study tended to be older, and many were on prescription medications, such as oral contraceptives.	0
"For diabetics, taking the sting out of insulin Two systems that could get insulin into the bloodstream (oral spray, inhaler) are in the latter stages of clinical trials and may make syringes obsolete.  This cycle of fear and denial has little to do with insulin itself, a normal human protein, but rather its method of delivery: a hypodermic needle.  Physicians hear a common refrain from patients with Type 2 diabetes: ""Not the needle! Not yet. Give me three more months. I'll be good!"" So they try with renewed vigor to control their disease without insulin through diet, exercise and oral medications. Inevitably, many patients lapse and their diabetes again slips out of control, doing invisible damage to their kidneys, nervous systems and cardiovascular health.  Many patients are afraid of needles or embarrassed at the prospect of carrying syringes and the associated stigma of "" shooting up"" before a meal. But pain and inconvenience aside, injectable insulin also carries a medical risk — hypoglycemia. This occurs when blood glucose falls too low, a common occurrence in people who've injected insulin that acts longer than needed, and one that can, in extreme circumstances, prove fatal.  For the nation's 23 million diabetics and 57 million pre-diabetics, many of whom use insulin, a better way to deliver insulin could be life-changing, enabling them to use insulin therapy earlier in the progression of their disease and reducing the long-term damage. And it could be possible.  Two products that could get insulin into the bloodstream without needle sticks are in the latter stages of clinical trials, with their makers hoping for Food and Drug Administration approval in the next two years.  One is administered via oral spray; the other is delivered via inhaler. Still more are in earlier phases of development. Together they offer the potential for treating the disease in a less onerous, less obvious, less painful fashion.  ""Soon after insulin was discovered in the 1920s, doctors immediately recognized that it would be an advantage if they could get it into the body without injection,"" says Dr. Gerald Bernstein, vice president for medical affairs for Generex, which developed the spray.  But getting insulin, a very large protein, past the body's protective barriers and absorbed across small patches of surface area has proved difficult.  Better delivery system  Injectable insulin is familiar — it's been around for 80 years — but it has drawbacks. The hormone must be injected multiple times throughout the day to help the body store glucose properly and keep bloodstream levels low. Uncontrolled high blood-sugar can destroy eyesight, nerves and kidney function."	0
"En Español  By Amanda Gardner  HealthDay Reporter  WEDNESDAY, Sept. 29, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- An intrauterine device that releases a progestin hormone may be an effective treatment for younger women with early-stage uterine cancer, Italian researchers report.  By delaying a total hysterectomy, which is the usual treatment for endometrial cancer, the IUD allows women to remain fertile and possibly to have families, according to the study published online Wednesday in Annals of Oncology, the monthly journal of the European Society for Medical Oncology.  ""The study was done to see if this was a viable option for younger women who want to preserve fertility,"" said Dr. Jamie Bakkum-Gamez, senior associate consultant in the division of gynecologic surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. ""We see it as buying more time to have a family and, once that's completed, to have a hysterectomy.""  ""It's a very important trial,"" added Dr. Angeles Alvarez Secord, associate professor of gynecologic oncology at Duke Comprehensive Cancer Center in Durham, N.C. ""I've been using [the IUD] clinically for several years now for this purpose in patients who desire future fertility and some patients who cannot undergo surgery or who are at high risk for surgical complications. It's a fantastic alternative to treat patients with these diseases, and this study will help doctors when they discuss [treatment options] with patients.""  Bakkum-Gomez has also used the method in her practice and is conducting a study of the IUD, which was originally designed as a contraceptive device, for this purpose.  About 3 percent to 5 percent of women who get endometrial cancer, which affects the womb lining, are under the age of 40 and will lose their fertility if they undergo a hysterectomy. The majority of these women have not yet had children, according to background information in the article.  Although the IUD is not yet approved to treat endometrial cancer, it is approved and widely used to treat endometriosis and abnormal uterine bleeding.  While hysterectomy or removal of the uterus is the accepted treatment for this kind of cancer, doctors have been using the hormone in oral form for the past 20 years, but only for ""well-selected groups of women,"" said Dr. Elizabeth Poynor, a gynecologic oncologist and pelvic surgeon with Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""Well selected,"" in this case, means those with early-stage disease who want to maintain their fertility, much like the group in this trial.  Oral hormone treatment to slow down the cancer's growth is a systemic therapy, however, and can have adverse side effects such as skin rashes, nausea and vomiting, headaches and abnormal uterine bleeding, according to background material accompanying the study.  The theoretical -- but still unproven -- advantage to this new IUD method, Poynor said, is that ""there is a lower risk of systemic side effects . . . and that you may be giving higher doses of the drug directly into the uterus.""  The authors followed 20 Italian patients from January 1996 to June 2009 with atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AEH), which often precedes the cancer, and 14 women with early-stage endometrial cancer confined to the inner layer of the womb.  Participants -- all of whom were between ages 20 and 40 -- had an IUD known as Mirena, which released levonorgestrel, inserted for a year. They also received monthly injections of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), which halts estrogen production, for six months.  The IUD was removed at the end of the year if there was no evidence of cancer.  Ninety-five percent of women with AEH initially saw their lesions disappear completely, while 57.1 percent of women with early-stage cancer also responded completely to the treatment. (The disease progressed in one of the women with AEH and four of the women with early-stage cancer.)  Of the patients with AEH, four later relapsed and required further treatment; of the women with early-stage cancer, two who had an initial complete response relapsed. However, all the women were alive and seemingly cancer-free by the end of the study after further treatment (either the IUD and GnRH treatment or a hysterectomy), the study reported.  ""They did show a higher recurrence or progression rate with endometrial cancer than with AEH and that is consistent with other data,"" said Bakkum-Gamez, who added that the IUD method would not be appropriate for later-stage cancers, which tend to be more aggressive.  No adverse effects from treatment were noted, according to the researchers, who declared no conflicts of interest.  In background material, the researchers stated the progestin-releasing IUD should be effective in treating AEH and also early endometrial cancer, as long as those patients were evaluated with laparoscopy, ultrasound and MRI to make sure their cancer had not spread and there was no simultaneous ovarian cancer.  Nine of the women in the study successfully delivered babies.  More i"	0
"Alzheimer's Redefined, But Changes Mean Little For Patients  Enlarge this image toggle caption Sebastien Bozon/AFP/Getty Images Sebastien Bozon/AFP/Getty Images  The definition of Alzheimer's disease just got wider and deeper, but the expansion won't change how the vast majority of people are diagnosed. It also doesn't change the very limited treatment choices.  But the new criteria, which were developed by the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer's Association, are almost guaranteed to prompt confusion, even in people who are thinking quite clearly.  For research, there's a lot of value. For everyday clinical use, very very little.  The guidelines say, for instance, that newly developed ""biomarker"" tests, such as assays for proteins in spinal fluid, and some specialized brain scans can be used for early diagnosis of Alzheimer's. But, the guidelines say, the tests are to be used only for research, and not for diagnosing Alzheimer's in the general public.  The distinction is nothing to worry about for patients and their families. ""You don't need a biomarker test"" for everyday clinical practice, says David Knopman, a professor of neurology at the Mayo Clinic, who was co-chairman of the group that revised the dementia diagnosis. The existing tests for Alzheimer's are adequate, he says. And those biomarkers? ""It's in the fine print, but it definitely says in multiple places that the biomarkers are for research purposes.""  Why? Well, the biomarker tests and PET scans aren't yet accurate enough to reliably diagnose Alzheimer's, and haven't been approved by the Food and Drug Administration. And it's also because there are no treatments that can prevent, slow or stop early signs of Alzheimer's.  ""For research, there's a lot of value,"" Knopman says. ""For everyday clinical use, very very little.""  About 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's. The hallmark signs are problems with thinking, learning, and memory. The current definition, created in 1984, describes Alzheimer's that way. But over the past few years there's been solid evidence that Alzheimer's starts damaging the brain years before a person starts having noticeable problems thinking. Scientists have been putting a lot of effort into trying to identify what starts the disease process, but have so far come up empty.  The new definitions, which were just published online by the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia, acknowledge this dimly understood early phase of Alzheimer's. Now there are two new pre-dementia phases: mild cognitive impairment and ""preclinical Alzheimer's.""  In mild cognitive impairment, a person's changes in thinking are noticeable to himself, friends, or family. They would show up on tests of memory and recall, but don't interfere with everyday activities. Alzheimer's is just one possible cause. Because there are no treatments to prevent or stop Alzheimer's, many people may not consider this diagnosis a blessing.  The second new phase, preclinical Alzheimer's, is much squishier. There's no list of symptoms that a doctor can whip out to say you've got it. Rather, the goal in creating this category is to see if scientists can define when the disease starts, and track it through biomarker tests, brain imaging, or other yet-to-be-invented tests. If that happens, it might someday lead to ways to prevent Alzheimer's. But for now this category is useful only to researchers.  The goal in all this, according to the Alzheimer's Association, is to increase opportunities for earlier diagnosis and treatment. The problem is that there aren't yet any reliable tools for earlier diagnosis and treatment. The new criteria are really a call for more research — and the money to fund it. That would be good for the Alzheimer's Association and the National Institute on Aging, which sponsored the work on the new criteria.  And it does leave one wondering if a lot more worry will be generated by the notion of ""preclinical Alzheimer's,"" when science and medicine can't offer anything to ease those fears."	0
(Reuters) - Asterias Biotherapeutics Inc said initial data from a small study showed that its lead stem cell therapy could improve mobility in patients paralyzed by a spinal cord injury.  Traders gather at the post that trades Asterias Biotherapeutics, Inc. on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange March 5, 2015. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid  The company’s shares were up 25 percent at $5.26 in mid-day trading on heavy volumes.  Shares of BioTime Inc, a company that owns nearly 70 percent of Asterias, were little changed at $3.07.  The therapy, AST OPC-1, is the first product derived from human embryos to be tested on humans.  Its success is a key step toward proving that embryonic stem cell research could cure diseases such as cancer, Parkinson’s and serious health conditions such immune deficiencies, stroke and spinal injuries.  Data showed that the severity of the spinal injury was reduced in the first patient and two other patients were able to resume their rehabilitation programs soon after being injected with the stem cells.  The early study tested the benefits of a smaller dose of 2 million stem cells that are tuned to develop into nerves.  Asterias bought OPC-1 in 2013 from the erstwhile stem cell research leader Geron Corp, which decided to focus on developing cancer drugs.  Geron chose to abandon its stem cell therapy in 2011 after such research got embroiled in the abortion debate, prompting many biotech companies to stay quiet about their research.  Monday’s announcement was the first about the therapy in more than two years.  In an early-stage study conducted by Geron, the therapy showed potential in repairing spinal injury in four of the five patients tested, without any adverse events.  Asterias is looking to show recovery of mobility in four out of every 10 patients treated with OPC-1, compared with two out of 10 achieving the same level of improvement without any treatment, Chief Executive Pedro Lichtinger told Reuters in early August.  Menlo Park, California-based Asterias expects to release complete safety data from the first half of the study later in the year.  Lichtinger said he was confident the data would be positive but was not expecting miracles.  “It is important to know that we do not expect patients to get up and play basketball,” he said. “But we do expect the patients to have significant improvements in mobility.”  Nearly 30,000 Asterias’s shares were traded by 12:30 p.m. ET, or more than twice their 25-day average trading volume.	0
In the late 1940s, the steroid cortisone, an anti-inflammatory drug, was first synthesized and hailed as a landmark. It soon became a safe, reliable means to treat the pain and inflammation associated with sports injuries (as well as other conditions). Cortisone shots became one of the preferred treatments for overuse injuries of tendons, like tennis elbow or an aching Achilles, which had been notoriously resistant to treatment. The shots were quite effective, providing rapid relief of pain.  Ballyscanion/Getty Images  Then came the earliest clinical trials, including one, published in 1954, that raised incipient doubts about cortisone’s powers. In that early experiment, more than half the patients who received a cortisone shot for tennis elbow or other tendon pain suffered a relapse of the injury within six months.  But that cautionary experiment and others didn’t slow the ascent of cortisone (also known as corticosteroids). It had such a magical, immediate effect against pain. Today cortisone shots remain a standard, much-requested treatment for tennis elbow and other tendon problems.  But a major new review article, published last Friday in The Lancet, should revive and intensify the doubts about cortisone’s efficacy. The review examined the results of nearly four dozen randomized trials, which enrolled thousands of people with tendon injuries, particularly tennis elbow, but also shoulder and Achilles-tendon pain. The reviewers determined that, for most of those who suffered from tennis elbow, cortisone injections did, as promised, bring fast and significant pain relief, compared with doing nothing or following a regimen of physical therapy. The pain relief could last for weeks.  But when the patients were re-examined at 6 and 12 months, the results were substantially different. Over all, people who received cortisone shots had a much lower rate of full recovery than those who did nothing or who underwent physical therapy. They also had a 63 percent higher risk of relapse than people who adopted the time-honored wait-and-see approach. The evidence for cortisone as a treatment for other aching tendons, like sore shoulders and Achilles-tendon pain, was slight and conflicting, the review found. But in terms of tennis elbow, the shots seemed to actually be counterproductive. As Bill Vicenzino, the chairman of sports physiotherapy at the University of Queensland in Australia and senior author of the review, said in an e-mail response to questions, “There is a tendency” among tennis-elbow sufferers “for the majority (70-90 percent) of those following a wait-and-see policy to get better” after six months to a year. But this is not the case for those getting cortisone shots, he wrote; they “tend to lag behind significantly at those time frames.” In other words, in some way, the cortisone shots impede full recovery, and compared with those adopting a wait-and-see policy, those getting the shots “are worse off.” Those people receiving multiple injections may be at particularly high risk for continuing damage. In one study that the researchers reviewed, “an average of four injections resulted in a 57 percent worse outcome when compared to one injection,” Dr. Vicenzino said.  Why cortisone shots should slow the healing of tennis elbow is a good question. An even better one, though, is why they help in the first place. For many years it was widely believed that tendon-overuse injuries were caused by inflammation, said Dr. Karim Khan, a professor at the School of Human Kinetics at the University of British Columbia and the co-author of a commentary in The Lancet accompanying the new review article. The injuries were, as a group, given the name tendinitis, since the suffix “-itis” means inflammation. Cortisone is an anti-inflammatory medication. Using it against an inflammation injury was logical.  But in the decades since, numerous studies have shown, persuasively, that these overuse injuries do not involve inflammation. When animal or human tissues from these types of injuries are examined, they do not contain the usual biochemical markers of inflammation. Instead, the injury seems to be degenerative. The fibers within the tendons fray. Today the injuries usually are referred to as tendinopathies, or diseased tendons.  Why then does a cortisone shot, an anti-inflammatory, work in the short term in noninflammatory injuries, providing undeniable if ephemeral pain relief? The injections seem to have “an effect on the neural receptors” involved in creating the pain in the sore tendon, Dr. Khan said. “They change the pain biology in the short term.” But, he said, cortisone shots do “not heal the structural damage” underlying the pain. Instead, they actually “impede the structural healing.”  Still, relief of pain might be a sufficient reason to champion the injections, if the pain “were severe,” Dr. Khan said. “But it’s not.” The pain associated with tendinopathies tends to fall somewhere around a 7 or so on a 10-point sca	0
Allergy treatments haven’t advanced much in decades, even as hundreds of millions around the world suffer from wheezing, itches, and rashes — and in severe cases, risk death — from exposure to allergens ranging from eggs to pollen to dog dander.  But hope may be on the way.  Scientists who study the immune system are beginning to understand the root cause of allergies — and are starting to work on next-generation therapies that could stop allergies in their tracks, rather than simply treating symptoms. Private investors and corporations are pouring money into the field.  advertisement  Sean Parker, the internet mogul of Napster fame, donated $24 million to set up an allergy research center at Stanford University. Nestlé this month invested $145 million in a startup aimed at tackling peanut allergy. And the Broad Institute of Cambridge, Mass., recently launched a new initiative to unravel the basic biology of food allergy.  The potential market is huge: It’s estimated that 50 million Americans have allergies. As many as 10 percent of children suffer from hay fever, nearly 12 percent have skin allergies, and 5 percent have food allergies, most commonly peanuts, dairy, and shellfish, according to the 2014 National Health Interview Survey.  “I foresee that a lot of allergy therapies will become more and more specific and targeted, and more customizable to the individual patient,” said Andrew Long, the lead investigational drug pharmacist at Stanford’s Sean N. Parker Center for Allergy & Asthma Research.  Answering ‘home brews’ with science    The experimental treatment that may be closest to market is also one of the simplest. Bay Area startup Aimmune, backed in part by Nestlé with that $145 million investment, is creating a methodical peanut desensitization pill that slowly weans patients away from allergy.  The company has identified the peanut proteins that trigger allergic reaction and is filling little capsules with the stuff. Patients start out by taking half a milligram of peanut protein, and gradually work their way up — over the course of about six months — to the equivalent of eating a single peanut.  “The people who need it the most are the people who have the most profound and potentially life-threatening reaction,” said Dr. Daniel Adelman, chief medical officer of Aimmune.  The capsules are science’s answer to previous efforts from allergists, who would concoct “home brews” of peanut protein to desensitize patients under the table. Aimmune’s peanut powder is in Phase 3 trials — and, despite its relative simplicity, is still considered something of a trailblazer in allergy science.  Tackling multiple allergies at once  Researchers at Stanford University are building on the concept of desensitization.  One of the drugs Long is excited about: omalizumab, a biologic drug made by Genentech under the trade name Xolair.  To understand how it works, you have to back up and look at why you get all itchy and wheezy when you encounter an allergen. Such responses make sense from an evolutionary standpoint: They initially came into being to protect our bodies against toxins, like snake venom, or to ward away parasites. But they can be deadly in the modern era.  Two types of immune cells — called mast cells and basophils — are the biggest culprits behind allergic reactions. When a person encounters an allergen, let’s say peanut protein, a type of antibody called immunoglobulin E, or IgE, gets activated. This stimulates the mast cells and basophils to release a storm of chemicals that provoke an allergic response to help exorcise peanut protein from the body.  Genentech’s drug is an engineered antibody that binds to human IgE, blocking it from triggering that chemical storm.  It was approved by the FDA in 2003 to treat a form of asthma often triggered by allergens, but Stanford researchers are now testing it on patients with food allergies — and finding that it might help speed along classic allergy desensitization therapy, in which patients are slowly introduced to escalating quantities of the allergen, via allergy shots or those “home brew” concoctions.  “Right now, the process of immunotherapy is painstakingly long — it takes not just weeks or months, but years, to treat a single allergy this way,” said Dr. Toshi Kawakami, a researcher at the La Jolla Institute for Allergy and Immunology.  This timeline becomes untenable for patients with multiple allergies — and about 70 percent of people who have an allergy to one type of food will also be allergic to another, Long said.  So Stanford has paired Xolair with desensitization therapy to treat up to five different food allergens at any given time. Instead of taking years to gird a patient’s body against peanuts, they’re able to help her control her reactions to, say, hazelnuts, fish, dairy, and wheat as well.  Looking at IgE from a different angle, Harvard statistical geneticist Liming Liang has been hunting for new drug targets that might modulate how, exactly, 	0
LONDON (Reuters Life!) - Britain’s leading heart charity launched a 50 million pound ($80 million) research project on Tuesday into the potential of stem cells to regenerate heart tissue and “mend broken hearts”.  Scientists leading the work for the British Heart Foundation (BHF) said they hope that within the next decade they may have experimental drugs in development that would give certain kinds of cells in the heart the ability to regenerate tissue, repair damage and therefore combat heart failure.  The ability of heart tissue to regenerate already occurs in some animals, such as zebrafish, which can regrow portions of their own hearts if they are damaged.  At a briefing in London to launch a “mending broken hearts” fundraising campaign, scientists said research into stem cells and developmental biology may in future make this possible in people too.  “Scientifically, mending human hearts is an achievable goal and we really could make recovering from a heart attack as simple as getting over a broken leg,” said Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director at the BHF.  Scientists in the United States reported last year that they had been able to turn structural heart cells into beating cells by identifying genes that, in a developing embryo, turn an immature cell into a beating heart cell or cardiomyocyte.  One of the British teams, led by Professor Paul Riley of the Institute of Child Health at University College London (UCL) has already found a natural protein, called thymosin beta 4, that plays a role in developing heart tissue.  He said his researchers had already had some success in using this protein to “wake up” cells known as epicardial cells in mice with damaged hearts.  “We hope to find similar molecules or drug-like compounds that might be able to stimulate these cells further,” he told reporters at the briefing.  Another team of researchers at Imperial College London will be looking at a group of rare latent stem cells that can be harvested and then grown in the laboratory.  These cells are highly active in developing hearts and can grow into new functioning tissue, but something in them gets switched off soon after humans are born, meaning that the heart is no longer able to repair any damage, said Professor Michael Schneider, who leads this team.  His researchers will be trying to find ways of re-activating the cells in a controlled and safe way, so that they are able to repair damaged heart tissue but will not grow out of control.  “One strategy would be to give a drug that would activate this kind of process,” he said, adding that this “requires more knowledge about what signals trigger these cells”.  Weissberg said if the research was as successful as they hoped, it could one day reduce or even eliminate the need for heart transplants for patients whose hearts are damaged.

You've probably heard about it — maybe you even remember seeing it once — but you're not really sure what it is or even where to find it.  The female condom (FC2), or internal condom, is a non-hormonal barrier method of birth control. But instead of going on a penis, it goes in a vagina, which is why it's also sometimes referred to as an internal condom. For more information, BuzzFeed Health spoke with two experts who could demystify this lesser-known contraceptive:  * Dr. Harry Fisch, clinical professor of urology and reproductive medicine at Weill Cornell Medical College, and chief corporate officer of Veru Healthcare, which distributes FC2  * Dr. Lauren Streicher, associate clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine	0
The Ache: Common cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins can have unpleasant side effects, including muscle aches and weakness.  The Claim: An extract from a bitter, fragrant citrus fruit called bergamot, commonly known as a flavoring in Earl Grey tea, can lower cholesterol with minimal side effects, some scientists say. It also boosts good cholesterol, reduces fatty deposits in the liver and lowers blood sugar, they add.  The Verdict: Bergamot has been shown to lower cholesterol in at least four human studies published or presented at scientific meetings. But much of the work is authored by a group of Italian researchers who work closely with a company that sells the extract, scientists say. Larger, independent studies in other countries are needed to confirm the results, they say.  Bergamot fruit grows on sunny slopes in Southern Italy and are rich in substances called flavonoids, which likely are the reason for its beneficial effects says Arrigo Cicero, a scientist in the atherosclerosis and metabolic disease research unit of the University of Bologna. But he adds that he feels additional human studies are needed to prove efficacy.  Flavonoids are antioxidants, or substances some scientists believe reduce chemical reactions in the body that damage cells. Earl Grey tea likely contains too little bergamot to have a therapeutic effect, scientists say, though the tea is high in another class of antioxidant called catechins.  Bergamot supplements, often in 500 milligram or 650 milligram capsules or tablets, are intended to be taken before meals. In human studies, a bergamot extract was shown effective at a dose of 500 milligrams to 1,500 milligrams a day, according to published results.  In a monthlong study of 77 patients published in 2013 in the International Journal of Cardiology, 1,000 milligrams daily of bergamot extract lowered cholesterol from an average of 278 milligrams per deciliter of blood to 191.  Bergamot Cholesterol Support, a new product from Reserveage Nutrition LLC of Gainesville, Fla., combines the citrus extract with resveratrol, an antioxidant derived from grapes and Japanese knotweed. Photo: Reserveage Organics  The study also found that by adding bergamot researchers were able to reduce by half the dose of the cholesterol drug rosuvastatin without a reduction in efficacy, says study co-author Vincenzo Mollace, professor at the Magna Graecia University in Catanzaro, Italy. Dr. Mollace, a cardiologist, is a paid scientific consultant to Italy’s Herbal & Antioxidant Derivatives Srl, which sells the extract for use in dietary supplements.  “The data looks very good,” says David Frid, a staff physician in the section of preventive cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic. “But it would be beneficial for this to be reproduced [by another research group] in order to say that in fact this is a true cholesterol-lowering effect.”  While Dr. Mollace’s study showed mild heartburn as the only side effect, larger long-term studies are needed to establish safety.  “I would tell a patient the caveat is, ‘If you want to try it, you need to be aware that we don’t really know its side effects,’ ” says Dr. Frid. In addition, he adds, statins have been shown to improve health outcomes, such as reducing heart attacks, while bergamot hasn’t yet met that rigorous test.  A glass of bergamot juice tastes like sour grapefruit, making capsules a palatable way to ingest a therapeutic dose, says Annie Eng, chief executive of HP Ingredients Inc., a Bradenton, Fla., company that sells its Bergamonte brand extract to about 30 U.S. dietary-supplement companies.  Some brands combine bergamot with other ingredients. Bergamot Cholesterol Support, a new product from Reserveage Nutrition LLC of Gainesville, Fla., combines the citrus extract with resveratrol, an antioxidant derived from grapes and Japanese knotweed.  The company hasn’t studied the combination, but it “logically it would make sense” that the two would work well together, says Rob Maru, the company’s chief innovation officer.  The amount of plant flavonoids in dietary supplements with bergamot will vary significantly depending on the fruit itself and how it is processed, scientists say. BergaMet Mega from Australia’s Nathealthsolutions Pty Ltd., is formulated to have the same potency of flavonoids as used in Dr. Mollace’s studies, says Chief Executive Selwyn Barr.  Dr. Mollace, who serves as an unpaid scientific advisor to Nathealthsolutions, confirmed that BergaMet has the same concentration of flavonoids as the extract he studied.  —Email aches@wsj.com	0
For older people who fracture a hip, the prognosis is grim: a third or more die within a year and only about 1 in 5 return to their pre-injury level of function.  A new approach to care could mean it doesn’t have to be that way.  More hospitals are putting hip fracture patients on a fast track from the emergency room to the operating room, repairing the fracture in as little as six hours after diagnosis. The approach appears to produce significantly better outcomes for patients than the conventional practice of waiting up to three days before operating on the fracture. It can also reduce the costs of complications and longer hospital stays.  Fast-track hospitals also are providing follow-up care in special geriatric fracture clinics that steer patients through rehabilitation, provide treatment to strengthen bones and help them return to independent living.  Martha Aldredge, 76, fell and fractured her hip in April while looking for a seat at her granddaughter’s high school concert near Greenville, S.C. Photo: Amy A. Chapman  An estimated 340,000 older adults suffer hip fractures in the U.S. annually, and many of them have other medical issues such as high blood pressure or heart disease. Doctors and surgeons have taken the position that fractures weren’t true emergencies, and studies suggested delaying surgery allows more time to evaluate patients and stabilize other conditions before giving them medical clearance for an operation.  But a review of more than 2 million patients led by researchers at NYU Langone Medical Center’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, and published last year in the Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma, found that compared with same-day surgery, each additional day of delay was associated with a significantly higher overall complication rate. And surgery two days and three or more days after admission was associated with higher rates of death.  The deaths are a combination of “complications related to the hip fracture and surgery, and overall decline in health that seems to be hastened after hip fracture,” says Dr. Joseph Zuckerman, study co-author and chair of Orthopaedic Surgery at NYU Langone.  “We have to start thinking differently, and treat a hip fracture with the same urgency as a heart attack or a stroke,” says Philip J. Devereaux, a cardiologist and researcher at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. He says delays can cause the physical trauma of a fracture to spark inflammatory responses in the body that increase stress on the heart and the immune system and increase risk for complications.  Dr. Devereaux, who also heads a surgical research group at McMaster’s Population Health Research Institute, is leading a large international trial, called Hip Attack, which will enroll up to 3,000 patients in 20 countries. The study will compare surgery within 6 hours for a hip fracture against standard care, typically surgery 24 hours after diagnosis. The aim is to determine the impact of accelerated surgery on death, heart attack, stroke, infection, and major bleeding. A pilot study in 2013, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, suggested patients receiving accelerated surgery had a 40% lower risk of major complications.  An X-ray of Martha Aldredge’s fractured hip. Photo: Bon Secours St. Francis Health System  Ms. Aldredge’s doctor inserted a long y-shaped rod in the femur bone from her hip to her knee. Photo: Bon Secours St. Francis Health System  It took just one missed step for Martha Aldredge, 76, to fall and fracture her hip one evening last April while looking for a seat at her granddaughter’s high school concert near Greenville, S.C. Though bystanders helped her up and she managed to sit through the concert, she wasn’t able to walk when it was over. After being helped into a rolling chair, a friend drove her to the emergency room of the Bon Secours St. Francis Health System’s Eastside campus in Greenville.  An X-ray showed the hip was badly fractured, so she was transferred by ambulance to the St. Francis Hospital in downtown Greenville where orthopedic surgeon Michael O’Boyle oversees the Osteoporotic Fracture Program dedicated to the care of older patients with hip fractures.  In the OR the next day at 5 p.m., Dr. O’Boyle inserted a long y-shaped rod in the femur bone from her hip to her knee. Ms. Aldredge stayed on an orthopedic floor for three days before being transferred to a rehabilitation floor for four more days.  “They made me walk right away, which turned out to be a great thing,” Ms. Aldredge says. Dr. O’Boyle’s team told her about the importance of building up muscle and she started outpatient physical therapy a week later, going two days a week for three months. She was able to stop using a walker and, after a break from therapy, is continuing for several more sessions to build her stamina. She is back to driving herself, and says her bones are in good enough shape that she doesn’t anticipate future problems.  Dr. O’Boyle says it took a ma	0

“This is the first time we have been able to regenerate a cornea in humans,” researcher May Griffith, PhD, of the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute and the University of Ottawa tells WebMD. “We are still in the prototype stage, but this shows that regenerating a human cornea is possible.”  Two years after having the corneas implanted, six of the 10 patients had improved vision . Nine of the 10 experienced cell and nerve regeneration, meaning that corneal cells and nerves grew into the implant.  In a newly released study, investigators from Canada and Sweden reported results from the first 10 people in the world treated with the biosynthetic corneas.  Aug. 25, 2010 -- Corneas made in the lab using genetically engineered human collagen could restore sight to millions of visually impaired people waiting for transplants from human donors, researchers say.  Too Few Corneas Available  Acting as the window to the eye, the cornea is made up largely of water and the fibrous protein collagen.  Worldwide, more than 10 million people have impaired vision or blindness as a result of corneal damage, but only a small fraction ever receive transplants from cadaver donors.  A shortage of human donor tissue coupled with the threat of graft rejection from donor corneal transplants has driven the search for other ways of treating corneal damage. Although synthetic corneal replacements made from plastic are available, they have many drawbacks and are considered an option for only a small percentage of people.  It has been 10 years since Griffith and colleagues first reported the development of a material with the potential to grow healthy new tissue in people with damaged corneas.  To make the material, the researchers placed a human gene that regulates the natural production of collagen into specially programmed yeast cells. They then molded the resulting material into the shape of a cornea.  After several years of testing in her lab, Griffith began collaborating with Swedish eye surgeon Per Fagerholm of Linkoping University, who implanted the engineered collagen corneas into the 10 patients in Sweden.  None of the patients experienced graft rejection or required long-term immune suppression -- two potential side effects with human donor corneal transplants. The corneas were sensitive to touch and produced normal tears.  The results were published in the journal Science Translational Medicine. The research was primarily funded by grants from the Canadian Stem Cell Network, the Swedish Research Council, and the Marie Curie International Fellowship. The human collagen used to develop the corneas was provided by biotechnology company FibroGen Inc.	0
"Jan. 11, 2011 -- The herpes zoster vaccine, better known as the shingles vaccine and recommended for adults 60 and older, cuts the risk of getting the painful disease by 55%, new research finds.  ""Compared to childhood vaccines, people would [probably] think 55% is not too impressive, because many childhood vaccines are in the range of 80% to 90% [effective],"" says researcher Hung Fu Tseng, PhD, MPH, a research scientist at Kaiser Permanente Southern California.  However, he tells WebMD, the 55% risk reduction ''is pretty high compared to other adult vaccines.""  Getting the vaccine makes it less likely that adults will get the painful rash that can occur when the varicella zoster virus, which causes childhood chickenpox, reactivates to cause shingles. The associated pain can last months or even years.  About a million episodes of shingles, sometimes debilitating, occur in the U.S. annually, Tseng says.  The new study is published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.  Another new study, published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, finds that by 2008, less than 7% of U.S. adults aged 60 and older had gotten the vaccine, which has been available just since 2006.  Called Zostavax, the shingles vaccine is made by Merck."	0
Paul Lehrer, a respiration expert at Rutgers University, said that hyperventilation alone would create a host of disturbing symptoms that could trigger emotional reactions, but that the pace and regularity of breathing were also important. No one breathes in perfect rhythm all day. We hold our breath when we're concentrating. We take in more air when we exercise. Irregular breathing in the form of frequent sighing and yawning, though, brings in more air and can contribute to hyperventilation. Breath-holding, and the subsequent compensation, also can lead to hyperventilation.	0
NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Colonoscopy may miss as many as one in every 13 colon cancers, suggests a new study.  Canadian researchers note that their finding should be a heads-up to clinicians performing the exam, as well as to patients preparing for it. Both groups could do things to improve the detection rate, they said.  “Several recent studies have raised questions on the effectiveness of colonoscopy as currently performed in everyday clinical practice on reducing risk of subsequent colon cancer,” lead researcher Dr. Harminder Singh, of the University of Manitoba, Winnipeg, in Canada, told Reuters Health by e-mail. “Therefore, it is important to study the factors associated with the diagnosis of colon cancer occurring after colonoscopy.”  During a colonoscopy, a flexible camera is passed through the colon in search of abnormal growths known as polyps and other warning signs of early tumors. It is one of a few screening tests for colon cancer, the second-leading cancer killer in the U.S., according the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  Another less expensive test is fecal occult blood testing, which involves taking stool specimens at home and mailing them to the doctor’s office or medical lab. The US Preventive Services Task Force, an independent panel of medical experts appointed by the federal government, recommends screening people aged 50 to 75 for the disease, but does not specify which test is best.  In their study, Singh and his colleagues identified nearly 5,000 individuals aged 50 to 80 who had been diagnosed with the cancer between 1992 and 2008, across the entire Canadian province of Manitoba.  The team found that about eight percent, or one in every 13 cancers, had been missed during colonoscopies conducted six months to three years prior to diagnosis.  Women were a third more likely to have had their cancer missed, report the researchers in The American Journal of Gastroenterology. And general practice physicians missed cancers 60 percent more often than gastroenterologists.  There are three likely reasons for these “misses,” noted Dr. David Lieberman of the Oregon Health and Science University, in Portland. Tumors may simply have gone unidentified on the exam, or were seen but not completely removed. While rare, he also noted that it is possible that an undetected cancer was actually not present at the exam, but rather grew very quickly afterwards.  No improvement in colonoscopy can do anything to avoid the latter. But the first two reasons are potentially avoidable, Lieberman told Reuters Health in an e-mail.  Given the wide variation in colonoscopy training, the researchers call for standardizing it, including credentialing and re-credentialing.  “There is an urgent need to focus on and improve the outcomes of colonoscopy,” Singh said.  However, Lieberman cautioned against the over-interpretation of the results. “These patients were referred for colonoscopy, most commonly due to symptoms,” Lieberman said. “This is very different from a population undergoing screening.”  Colonoscopy would probably miss a smaller percentage of cancers in such a large population, Lieberman said, because the rate would be lower.  Dr. Charles Kahi of the Indiana University School of Medicine, in Indianapolis, noted that the rate found in the new study was a bit higher than previously reported. But he added that the risk factors identified match those in the earlier studies.  “The key to maximizing protection against colorectal cancer after colonoscopy is performance by an operator with excellent examination” and growth-removal technique, “in a well-prepped colon,” Kahi told Reuters Health by e-mail.  And for this, patients should do their part. “To increase their chances of an early diagnosis, it is important that all individuals undergoing colonoscopy strictly follow the instructions for bowel preparation for colonoscopy,” added Singh, speaking of the large amounts of special drinks consumed before the test to clean out the bowel. “It may be a nuisance but it will help maximize the view during (colonoscopy).”  SOURCE: link.reuters.com/pec37p The American Journal of Gastroenterology, online September 28, 2010.	0
An ibuprofen patch that delivers the painkiller directly through the skin to the site of pain, at a consistent dose for up to 24 hours, has been developed by UK researchers.  Scientists at the University of Warwick and spin-off company Medherant say their TEPI patch could revolutionize the transdermal drug delivery market.  University of Warwick research chemist Professor David Haddleton told Reuters that the polymer matrix in the patch acts as a reservoir for the drug, capable of releasing between five and ten times the amount of drugs used in gels and patches currently on the market, for periods of six hours, 12 hours, and even 24 hours.  “What we do is dissolve the active ibuprofen, for example, into the adhesive so we can have quite a high loading - so up to 30 percent of the adhesive will be the ibuprofen,” said Haddleton. “When that’s placed on the skin just like an elastoplast then the drug will actually diffuse across the skin into the body at the site of the pain and then relieve the pain in the same way as current gels and creams. We’re controlling the dosage and we’re keeping it there for a prolonged period of time.”  The patches could help treat conditions like chronic back pain, neuralgia and arthritis without the need to take potentially damaging doses of the drug orally. The team says that popular ibuprofen gels make it difficult to control dosage and can be easily rubbed off.  Although TEPI patch remains highly tacky and adheres well to skin, it is not uncomfortable to peel off, unlike many traditional plasters.  According to Andrew Lee, co-founder of Medherant, “we’ve only been in the lab about 12 months, but in the 12 months we’ve essentially assessed about 90 percent of the drugs that are currently available as either creams or patches. We’ve tested them in our polymers with very good results, we’ve been able to get increased loadings of drugs in the polymer and we’ve shown almost across the board that we can get a steady release rate of that drug from the polymer as well.”  The team says TEPI patches could go on sale within three years, and Medherant is working with some large, unnamed, pharmaceutical companies to get them ready for market.  Haddleton says the technology has exciting potential for other medications, such as opioid painkillers. “What’s important is to be able to extend the range of drugs that are available by patches because at the moment we’re limited to about 20 different drugs, and there are thousands of drugs out there, and only about 20 are used in patches at the moment, which is limited by the technology of the adhesive, essentially,” he said.  Lee told Reuters that many commercial patches do not contain pain relief agents at all, and merely sooth the body with a warming effect. He said Medherant’s technology would eliminate most side effects created by oral medication.  “One of the interesting areas that we plan to explore in partnership with large companies is actually using our platform technology to include other drugs that previously maybe haven’t been suitable for topical or transdermal delivery - or drugs which may have not got through the regulatory filings because, for instance, they might have caused stomach irritation or other side effects when taken orally,” said Lee.  The TEPI patch incorporates new adhesive technology developed by global adhesive company Bostik. Lee believes ibuprofen strips could be useful for sports participants, helping alleviate conditions such as tendonitis, and repetitive strain injuries. Nutrition companies have also shown an interest in adapting Medherant’s technology for transmitting minerals and vitamins through the skin.	0
While breathing fresh, clean air can boost productivity, sleep and overall health, not everyone can live in the great outdoors and it’s difficult to know just how clean the indoor air in your home or office is.  Since most people spend about 90 percent of their time inside, having poor indoor air quality could affect your health and the health of your family members—especially during winter.  “Low dry humidity in the winter can make asthma worse and children who have dried mucosa can acquire some nasal infections easier,” Dr. Robert G. Lahita, chairman of medicine at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center in New Jersey, told FoxNews.com. “Heating ducts that have mold and spores in them can make respiratory symptoms worse in the winter when hot air is blowing through them. Dry air can also exacerbate some illnesses and can be a problem as well.”  Different sources of air pollution in your home could include paints that release lead or volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carpets that harbor dirt, dust mites, and fungus and even nitrogen dioxide from gas stoves, but these aren’t the worst culprits, Lahita said.  “In the winter the biggest issue is carbon monoxide poisoning, with emergency medical services we see a few of these every year-- it is from faulty heaters, cooking without ventilation or fireplaces,” he said.  Every room in your house could be susceptive to some form of an air pollutant, but now there is a new device and app that says it can help you breathe easier by tracking air quality.  Awair is the first smart air quality device that monitors, analyzes and provides feedback to improve the air you breathe. The device collects data such as indoor temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, fine dust particles and VOCs. It analyzes the data in real-time and gives an Awair score on a 0 to 100 color-coded scale, 0 being the worst air quality.  “The goal for the user is to keep five green dots. As soon as you see other colored (amber and red) dots show up on top of the green dots, your environment is getting off the healthy ranges whether it being temperature, humidity, CO2, VOCs, and dust,” Ronald Ro, the CEO and co-founder of Bitfinder Inc., the makers of Awair, told FoxNews.com.  Based on your air score, the monitoring gadget will send personalized alerts and advice to the user via its corresponding Awair mobile app. When air conditions are harmful, like when a bedroom has a high carbon dioxide level, it will send a notification to the user and advise them to open up a window through the app. The app also provides Mayo Clinic “message cards” that give relevant information and recommendations for ways to keep your indoor environment healthy.  If you already have a smart device system for your home, Awair is working on partnerships with several connected devices like Nest thermostat and other smart appliances so you can manage the air quality in your home or office when you're not there.  The Awair app is free to download, but each device costs $199 dollars.  For more information go to GetAwair.com.	1
"""But the study offers evidence that targeting beta-amyloid can benefit patients,"" she says. Larger studies in many more patients are needed before the drug will be available, though, she says.  The benefit is small and studies have been inconsistent, says researcher Rachelle Doody, MD, head of Alzheimer’s disease research at Baylor College of Medicine.  Called solanezumab, the drug attaches to a protein called beta-amyloid that builds up and clumps together to form sticky plaques that riddle Alzheimer's patients' brains. The drug is designed to prevent those clumps from forming.  Oct. 8, 2012 (Boston) -- An experimental Alzheimer ’s treatment slowed memory loss by about one-third in people with mild Alzheimer's , offering hope that the drug can alter the course of the progressive disease.  'Encouraging' Results  Maria Carrillo, PhD, a neuroscientist and vice president for medical and scientific relations for the Alzheimer’s Association, calls the results ""encouraging"" and says she hopes development will continue.  ""While [beta-amyloid] is the leading hypothesis of what causes the disease, that has remained unproven. This study may not have hit on everything, and it is not the home run we wanted, but it is the first time we’ve seen cognitive benefit with an amyloid treatment,"" she says.  The latest results come from a combined analysis of a 1,012-patient study and a 646-patient study, both of which involved people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease.  When the findings of the two studies were looked at individually, patients given solanezumab for 18 months didn’t do better on either a test used to measure patients' symptoms or a measure of how well patients are functioning than patients given a placebo.  Combining the two studies to give them more statistical power showed that patients on solanezumab didn’t lose their memories as quickly as those on placebo.  The results really became clear when the researchers looked only at those patients with mild, early-stage disease. In the analysis, those given solanezumab had a 34% reduction in memory loss and other mental symptoms compared with those on placebo. There was even a hint that the drug helped to slow the decline in functioning.  Asked if the 34% improvement in cognitive decline is meaningful to a patient, Carrillo said, ""I have a family member with AD. I would be happy with a sustained cognitive benefit for my mother-in-law.""  The only side effect that happened more often in people on solanezumab than patients on placebo was chest pain: 1.1% vs. 0.2%."	0
"latimes.com/news/science/la-he-aspirin-cancer-20101207,0,1152105.story  By Thomas H. Maugh II, Los Angeles Times  December 7, 2010  Advertisement  A daily dose of baby aspirin may reduce mortality from a range of common cancers by an average of 21%, with the reduction persisting for at least 20 years, British researchers reported Monday.    Deadly cases of stomach, colorectal and esophageal cancers all declined among people who took low-dose aspirin for 10 to 20 years, according to a study published online in the journal Lancet. The chewable tablets also were linked to a reduced risk of death from adenocarcinoma and from lung cancer in nonsmokers.    The results were based on an analysis of more than 10,000 people who participated in seven clinical trials designed to test whether baby aspirin could reduce the risk of heart disease.    ""We already had strong evidence that low-dose aspirin could reduce deaths from colorectal cancer by as much as a third, but this provides important new evidence that long-term aspirin use can provide protection against a variety of other cancers,"" said epidemiologist Eric Jacobs of the American Cancer Society. However, he added, ""it would be premature at this point to recommend that people start using aspirin specifically to prevent cancer.""    For the millions of people who are currently taking low doses of aspirin to protect against cardiovascular disease, ""the findings suggest that they should have some additional benefit for cancer,"" said Dr. Lori Minasian, who is in charge of large cancer prevention trials at the National Cancer Institute.    Most of the studies examined by the British researchers involved primarily men, but the team said that the fundamental mechanisms involved probably hold equally for women. However, they added, there were not enough women involved in the studies to determine if daily aspirin could affect mortality from breast, ovarian or endometrial cancer.    A variety of studies in animals — and even in plants — show that salicylate, the active ingredient in aspirin, can suppress tumors. Observational data in the 1970s suggested that aspirin could suppress tumors in humans, but alternative explanations were offered and experts demanded randomized clinical trials.    In October, Dr. Peter M. Rothwell of the University of Oxford and his colleagues reported on an analysis of four clinical trials comparing a daily dose of 75 milligrams of aspirin to a placebo in the prevention of strokes. They found that those who received the aspirin reduced their risk of developing colon cancer by 24% and their risk of dying from the disease by 35%.    (A dose of European baby aspirin is typically 75 mg; in the United States it is 81 mg. A typical full-strength aspirin tablet is 300 mg.)    In the new study, Rothwell and colleagues started with eight clinical trials involving 25,570 people. They found that during the period of the clinical trials, which typically lasted for about four years, the risk of death from cancer declined by about 21% among those who were in the aspirin group.    Digging further, the researchers realized that nearly half of the subjects had been tracked for two decades — long after their trials had ended. The researchers ""spent several years looking through dusty archives"" to track their fates and quantify the long-term benefits of aspirin for cancer prevention, Rothwell said in a news conference.    Over a 10-year period, baby aspirin was linked to a 32% reduction in the risk of lung cancers in nonsmokers and a 30% drop in the risk of death from adenocarcinoma, the study found. Longer-term, aspirin was associated with a 64% decrease in fatal cases of esophageal cancer, a 58% drop in fatal cases of stomach cancer and a 49% reduction in the risk of death from colorectal cancer, the study found.    Aspirin was not found to influence the risk of death from pancreatic, prostate, bladder, kidney, brain or blood cancers, according to the Lancet report. Taking larger doses of aspirin and smoking had no effect on the results; neither did gender.    Rothwell noted that most of the subjects stopped taking aspirin at the end of the study — or, alternatively, many in the control group began taking it — potentially confusing the results.    ""It's likely that if people had carried on taking aspirin,"" the benefit would have been greater, he said. ""The benefit increased quite steeply with the length of time people were on it.""    Researchers are not quite sure how the aspirin works. In the test tube, when cells divide, there is a chance the DNA in the new cells will be faulty. Healthy cells will recognize those defects and either repair them or cause the defective cells to self-destruct, said Dr. Tom W. Meade of the University of London, a coauthor of the paper.    ""Both mechanisms are enhanced by aspirin,"" he said.    The biggest potential risk of aspirin is gastrointestinal bleeding. Rothwell noted that the normal risk of GI bleeding is about 1 in every 2,0"	0
"May 31, 2012 -- Should people at high risk of heart attack and stroke eat dark chocolate every day?  Maybe, according to a new study from Australia.  ""Dark chocolate may be a pleasant and effective way of delivering important dietary components that can provide health benefits to the ever increasing numbers of people at increased risk of cardiovascular disease,"" says researcher Christopher M. Reid, PhD, professor of cardiovascular epidemiology and preventive medicine at Monash University in Australia.  Reid and his team constructed a mathematical model to predict the long-term health effects of eating dark chocolate daily in high-risk people. They did not study actual people eating actual chocolate.  The researchers also computed whether it would be cost-effective to spend money on a public education campaign about dark chocolate's benefits. They found it would be.  Several studies have found that dark chocolate, with its heart-healthy flavonols, can lower blood pressure and improve cholesterol.  However, Reid believes theirs is the first study to model the long-term effects of eating dark chocolate in reducing cardiovascular risk.  The study is published in the journal BMJ."	0
(Reuters Health) - Improvement or worsening of chest pain symptoms and quality of life after a CT scan of the heart may depend on what the scan finds, a large study suggests.  Siemens logo is pictured on a CT scan in the manufacturing plant of Siemens Healthineers in Forchheim near Nuremberg, Germany, October 7, 2016. REUTERS/Michaela Rehle  People who have coronary artery disease ruled out by the scan benefit, and so do those with severe blockages diagnosed, while those who have moderate artery disease confirmed may only become more anxious after the scan, researchers found.  Computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA), is a high-resolution X-ray of the heart that can be used to diagnose the reason for angina, or chest pain, symptoms and clarify what other treatments might be needed.  “Patients with normal coronary arteries or those with severe coronary artery disease seemed to get the most benefit in quality of life and did best,” senior study author Dr. David E. Newby from University/BHF Center for Cardiovascular Science in Edinburgh, told Reuters Health.  “This suggests that being reassured that all is normal is highly valued by patients and CTCA really helps provide this reassurance. Conversely, knowing the cause of your symptoms is due to coronary heart disease and patients undergo treatment for it, is also very helpful,” he said by email.  Although getting CTCA is associated with a lower likelihood of having a heart attack later on, its effects on symptoms and quality of life may vary, the researchers note in the journal Heart.  Newby and his team assessed how CTCA affected symptoms and quality of life six weeks and six months after the scan for 4,146 patients with suspected angina due to coronary heart disease.  When the CTCA results revealed something less than a blockage, so-called nonobstructive disease, as the cause for the patient’s chest pain, patients’ quality of life got worse in the following weeks and months.  This reflects the fact that the cause of the symptoms had been unknown before and in addition they now have heart artery disease that needs treatment, Newby said.  The findings were similar when it came to changes in symptoms during follow-up. Improvements in symptoms were greatest in patients diagnosed with normal coronary arteries or who had their medications discontinued and least in those with moderate nonobstructive disease or who received new prescriptions.  “Although CTCA removes diagnostic uncertainty and halves the rate of subsequent heart attacks, quality of life can be negatively impacted in those who are worried about their health and are found to have nonobstructive coronary artery disease,” Newby said. “Much like screening tests for cancer, being told you have heart disease does not make the patient feel better,” he added.  If a doctor is faced with a patient who is already on an aspirin and statin with an unconfirmed and questionable clinical diagnosis of angina due to coronary heart disease, he said, then CTCA would be useful because finding normal heart anatomy means that more invasive testing can be avoided, treatment could be stopped and quality of life improved.  “If, however, a patient presents with atypical symptoms and is on no therapy, then the clinician needs to discuss with the patient the implications of potential CTCA findings, including nonobstructive disease that would mandate life-long preventative therapy,” Newby said. “Certainly, this is something we now discuss in more detail with our patients, some of whom have declined CTCA.”  “It was striking for me that health status was very much related to receiving a (treatable) diagnosis or excluding such a diagnosis, rather than experiencing angina symptoms per se,” said Dr. Paula M. C. Mommersteeg from the Center of Research on Psychology in Somatic Diseases, Tilburg University, The Netherlands, who has investigated associations between personality traits and coronary artery disease symptoms.  “In my opinion, CTCA does have added value in the diagnostic process (improved decision making), it is less invasive than coronary angiography (CAG), and can provide more clarity in the cardiac symptoms experienced by patients,” Mommersteeg concluded.

A scourge we can eliminate, if we choose wisely: the human papillomavirus. Photo by the Laboratory of Tumor Virus Biology  Through an article in Forbes I saw that a new study has been published about the safety of Gardasil, a vaccine for prevention of certain strains of human papillomavirus, or HPV.  HPV is a virus that can lead to genital warts, many types of cancer, and cervical cancer in women, which kills 4,000 women every year in the U.S. alone.  The Gardasil vaccine, on the other hand, caused some people to faint after getting it, and others got mild skin infections—both of which occur somewhat rarely with other vaccines too, as you might expect.  Which sounds worse to you?  The study, published in the Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal, looked at the published data about effects from the vaccine and found that it has a “favorable safety profile.” This study comes after many other previous studies that show essentially the same thing. There is no correlation between getting the Gardasil vaccine and seriously adverse effects such as “autoimmune diseases (including Guillain-Barre Syndrome and multiple sclerosis), anaphylaxis, venous thromboembolism, and stroke.”  Mind you, all these things and more have been used by people who attack vaccines as an argument against it. And, just like essentially every claim made by the anti-vaccination movement, these arguments are wrong.  That doesn’t stop them from making them, or from them getting attention by mainstream media; attention they most assuredly do not deserve.  It’s very frustrating; mounds of data show these vaccinations are incredibly low-risk, but it only takes a little bit of doubt and fear to make vaccine rates drop. For example, a young girl died tragically not long after getting the vaccine, and it got a lot of press, but it was later found that she died of a completely unrelated cause. This, sadly, is expected; more than 178 million doses of Gardasil have been given worldwide, and given that huge number it’s a statistical certainty that some young people will die not long after getting them. But as the saying goes, correlation is not causation. The vaccines are not to blame here.  Even more frustrating about this vaccine is that it’s being fought by an unusual group of people; while most anti-vax leanings are not affiliated with any particular political persuasion, Gardasil gets attacked additionally by conservatives who think that girls getting it will become more promiscuous, because HPV is a sexually transmitted disease.  However, this has been shown to be false. Worse, these same people tend to promote abstinence-only education, which has been shown conclusively to be the worst possible sex education; kids taught his way tend to have more pregnancies and more STIs than ones who are taught progressive, healthy sex ed.  It’s like Bizarro world, where everything is backward. All the evidence shows Gardasil to be safe and to be effective against a virus that causes horrific illnesses. It also shows that the claims made by anti-vaxxers are wrong, and that people fighting the vaccine because of their own sexual biases are making things far worse.  And yet they dig in. They insist real science is wrong, that their anecdotes are better, that the entire medical industry is on the take (which is silly beyond reason).  But that’s where we are. When it comes to health issues, especially ones tied to sexuality, reason goes out the window and emotions take over.  That’s why I am very, very clear about this: I and my family are all up to date with our vaccinations, and my daughter has had all three stages of the Gardasil vaccine (we’d have done that if she had been a boy, too). As a parent, as someone who knows and loves someone with an autoimmune disorder, and as a person who knows just how truly awful so many diseases are and how easily and safely they can be prevented, I am a strong advocate for vaccinations.  It’s your body, but it affects literally everyone around you. Don’t listen to the anti-vaxxers, who just want to scare you. Get the facts. And please, talk to your board-certified doctor and find out if there are any vaccinations you need.  How many lives will you save when you do?

"En Español  WEDNESDAY, Sept. 5, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Taking fish oil supplements during pregnancy might translate into healthier growth in children during their first six years of life, a new study suggests.  ""This study highlights the fact that in utero exposure can have a profound effect on the fetus that lasts through childhood,"" said Dr. Jennifer Wu, an obstetrician-gynecologist from Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.  ""For the past decade, the importance of fish oil and the omega-3 fatty acids have been stressed to patients,"" explained Wu, who was not involved in the study.  ""The use of fish oil in the latter part of the pregnancy has an impact on bone and muscle mass. Though these children are larger, they do not have increased rates of obesity,"" Wu added.  In the study, the researchers followed 736 pregnant women in Denmark who took either fish oil or olive oil supplements daily from week 24 of their pregnancy until one week after they gave birth.  The children were assessed 11 times between birth and the age of 6 years. Those whose mothers took the fish oil supplements during pregnancy sustained a higher body mass index (BMI) from the age of 1 to 6 years.  However, the higher BMI was not due to a higher percentage of fat, but rather to higher percentages of lean muscle and bone mass, the researchers found.  At age 6, children whose mothers took fish oil supplements while pregnant had a 395 grams higher total mass, 281 grams higher lean mass and 10 grams higher bone mineral content than children whose mothers who took olive oil during pregnancy, the findings showed.  ""The body composition at age 6 years in children given fish oil supplementation was characterized by a proportional increase in lean, bone and fat mass, suggesting a general growth-stimulating effect,"" the researchers, who were led by Hans Bisgaard, from the University of Copenhagen, wrote in the report.  However, the findings only showed an association and did not prove that fish oil pills caused healthier growth in children.  According to Dr. Jill Rabin, co-chief of the division of ambulatory care, Women's Health Programs-PCAP Services at Northwell Health, in New Hyde Park, N.Y., ""In pregnancy and beyond, adequate intake of fish is important for normal human development, and this paper certainly adds to the literature.""  But Rabin, who was not involved in the study, did add a few caveats about the findings.  The population studied was relatively homogenous, and ""the [body mass] findings were not the object of the study (wheezing or asthma in children was the primary objective), growth was a secondary finding,"" Rabin explained. ""Certainly, however, this solid paper adds to the literature and paves the way for additional research on this interesting topic.""  The report by Bisgaard and colleagues was published online Sept. 4 in the BMJ.  More information  The American Academy of Pediatrics has more on healthy growth."	0
"En Español  By Ed Edelson  HealthDay Reporter  TUESDAY, Feb. 2, 2010 (HealthDay News) --When a doctor wants to assess the condition of heart arteries without putting a gadget into those blood vessels, the X-ray technology called computed tomography -- more commonly called a CT scan -- is better than magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, a German review of studies has found.  ""For ruling out coronary artery disease, CT is more accurate than MRI,"" researchers from Humboldt University in Berlin said in a report in the Feb. 2 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.  The standard method for checking heart arteries is coronary angiography, which involves threading a thin, flexible tube, called a catheter, into the heart. But doctors do not always want to run the risks that can be associated with that technique, and the leading candidates for less invasive assessment are CT and MRI.  CT is a scanning technique using X-rays that produce a set of slice-by-slice heart images, up to 16 slices, depending on the power of the machine. MRI uses a powerful magnetic field and pulses of radiowave energy to create images.  The German researchers looked at results of 109 published studies of noninvasive heart artery imaging, including 89 that used CT and 20 that used MRI and involving 8,505 people. In the studies of people with suspected coronary artery disease, CT proved to be 97 percent sensitive, compared with 87 percent sensitivity for MRI exams, the analysis found. Sensitivity rates the ability of a test to correctly identify people who have a particular disease.  ""This article holds no surprises whatever,"" said Dr. Uwe Joseph Schoepf, a professor of radiology and cardiology at the Medical University of South Carolina. ""This is really something that is sort of common trade knowledge.""  Indeed, CT and MRI are not contenders in clinical practice but are used for different reasons to make different assessments, Schoepf said. ""It is a question of what specific question you are looking to answer,"" he said.  CT is the preferred noninvasive technology for assessing the condition of heart arteries, whether there is narrowing that might end with the total blockage that causes a heart attack, Schoepf said. ""MRI is not in current use to look at coronary artery disease,"" he said. ""We use MRI angiography if we are interested in heart muscle, as when there are congenital heart abnormalities in children. The strength of MRI is that it shows tissue configuration.""  That difference helps explain why there are so few studies doing head-to-head comparison of CT versus MRI, he said. The German analysis found only five such studies.  Dr. Ricardo Cury, director of cardiac MRI and CT at Baptist Cardiac & Vascular Institute in Miami and a consultant radiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, said that the ""meta-analysis demonstrates a knowledge that we have accumulated for the past several years.""  ""For imaging of the cardiac arteries, CT is more robust,"" Cury said. ""We perform MRI on a clinical basis more for functional assessment, as opposed to looking at the coronary arteries.""  Though that difference is well established among radiologists, the new study may be of assistance in the general medical community, including general cardiologists, because ""it summarizes the advantages of CT at this point in time,"" he said.  Indeed, CT appears to be better for assessment of coronary artery disease, matched against not only MRI but other methods, such as echocardiography, he said.  More information  The Cleveland Clinic has more on CT, MRI and similar tests."	1
“This is such a radical change in thought that it’s been hard for many people to get their heads around it,” said Dr. Monica Morrow, chief of the breast service at Sloan-Kettering and an author of the study, which is being published Wednesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association. The National Cancer Institute paid for the study.  Doctors and patients alike find it easy to accept more cancer treatment on the basis of a study, Dr. Morrow said, but get scared when the data favor less treatment.  The new findings are part of a trend to move away from radical surgery for breast cancer. Rates of mastectomy , removal of the whole breast, began declining in the 1980s after studies found that for many patients, survival rates after lumpectomy and radiation were just as good as those after mastectomy.  The trend reflects an evolving understanding of breast cancer. In decades past, there was a belief that surgery could “get it all” — eradicate the cancer before it could spread to organs and bones. But research has found that breast cancer can begin to spread early, even when tumors are small, leaving microscopic traces of the disease after surgery.  The modern approach is to cut out obvious tumors — because lumps big enough to detect may be too dense for drugs and radiation to destroy — and to use radiation and chemotherapy to wipe out microscopic disease in other places.  But doctors have continued to think that even microscopic disease in the lymph nodes should be cut out to improve the odds of survival. And until recently, they counted cancerous lymph nodes to gauge the severity of the disease and choose chemotherapy. But now the number is not so often used to determine drug treatment, doctors say. What matters more is whether the disease has reached any nodes at all. If any are positive, the disease could become deadly. Chemotherapy is recommended, and the drugs are the same, no matter how many nodes are involved.  The new results do not apply to all patients, only to women whose disease and treatment meet the criteria in the study.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The tumors were early, at clinical stage T1 or T2, meaning less than two inches across. Biopsies of one or two armpit nodes had found cancer, but the nodes were not enlarged enough to be felt during an exam, and the cancer had not spread anywhere else. The women had lumpectomies, and most also had radiation to the entire breast, and chemotherapy or hormone-blocking drugs, or both.  The study, at 115 medical centers, included 891 patients. Their median age was in the mid-50s, and they were followed for a median of 6.3 years.  After the initial node biopsy , the women were assigned at random to have 10 or more additional nodes removed, or to leave the nodes alone. In 27 percent of the women who had additional nodes removed, those nodes were cancerous. But over time, the two groups had no difference in survival: more than 90 percent survived at least five years. Recurrence rates in the armpit were also similar, less than 1 percent. If breast cancer is going to recur under the arm, it tends to do so early, so the follow-up period was long enough, the researchers said.  One potential weakness in the study is that there was not complete follow-up information on 166 women, about equal numbers from each group. The researchers said that did not affect the results. A statistician who was not part of the study said the missing information should have been discussed further, but probably did not have an important impact.  It is not known whether the findings also apply to women who do not have radiation and chemotherapy, or to those who have only part of the breast irradiated. Nor is it known whether the findings could be applied to other types of cancer.  Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The results mean that women like those in the study will still have to have at least one lymph node removed, to look for cancer and decide whether they will need more treatment. But taking out just one or a few nodes should be enough.  Dr. Armando E. Giuliano, the lead author of the study and the chief of surgical oncology at the John Wayne Cancer Institute at St. John’s Health Center in Santa Monica , Calif., said: “It shouldn’t come as a big surprise, but it will.

"The MIND diet: 10 foods that fight Alzheimer's (and 5 to avoid)      istockphoto Doctors have been saying for years that what you eat can affect the health of your heart. Now there's growing evidence that the same is true for your brain. A new study by researchers at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago shows a diet plan they developed -- appropriately called the MIND diet -- may reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease by as much as 53 percent. Even those who didn't stick to the diet perfectly but followed it ""moderately well"" reduced their risk of Alzheimer's by about a third. Diet appears to be just one of ""many factors that play into who gets the disease,"" said nutritional epidemiologist Martha Clare Morris, PhD, the lead author of the MIND diet study. Genetics and other factors like smoking, exercise and education also play a role. But the MIND diet helped slow the rate of cognitive decline and protect against Alzheimer's regardless of other risk factors. The study, published in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia, looked at more than 900 people between the ages of 58 and 98 who filled out food questionnaires and underwent repeated neurological testing. It found participants whose diets most closely followed the MIND recommendations had a level of cognitive function the equivalent of a person 7.5 years younger. The MIND diet breaks its recommendations down into 10 ""brain healthy food groups"" a person should eat and five ""unhealthy food groups"" to avoid. It combines many elements of two other popular nutrition plans which have been proven to benefit heart health: the Mediterranean diet and the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet. (MIND stands for Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay.) But the MIND diet also differs from those plans in a few significant ways and proved more effective than either of them at reducing the risk of Alzheimer's. Click through to see which foods to eat -- and which ones to avoid -- for optimal brain health.  Green leafy vegetables istockphoto The MIND diet recommends frequent servings of green leafy vegetables. Kale, spinach, broccoli, collards and other greens are packed with vitamins A and C and other nutrients. At least two servings a week can help, and researchers found six or more servings a week provide the greatest brain benefits. The Mediterranean and DASH diets do not specifically recommend these types of vegetables, but the MIND diet study found that including greens in addition to other veggies made a difference in reducing the risk of Alzheimer's.  Other vegetables istockphoto Like other diets focused on weight loss and heart health, the MIND diet emphasizes the importance of vegetables for brain health. The researchers recommend eating a salad and at least one other vegetable every day to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's.  Nuts istockphoto Nuts are a good snack for brain health, according to the MIND diet study. Nuts contain healthy fats, fiber and antioxidants, and other studies have found they can help lower bad cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease. The MIND diet recommends eating nuts at least five times a week.  Berries istockphoto Berries are the only fruit specifically recommended in the MIND diet. ""Blueberries are one of the more potent foods in terms of protecting the brain,"" Morris said. She noted that strawberries have also shown benefits in past studies looking at the effect of food on cognitive function. The MIND diet recommends eating berries at least twice a week.  Beans istockphoto If beans aren't a regular part of your diet, they should be. High in fiber and protein, and low in calories and fat, they also help keep your mind sharp as part of the MIND diet. The researchers recommend eating beans three times a week to help reduce the risk of Alzheimer's.  Whole grains Tom Perkins Whole grains are a key component of the MIND diet. It recommends at least three servings a day.  Fish istockphoto The MIND diet study found eating fish at least once a week helps protect brain function. However, there's no need to go overboard; unlike the Mediterranean diet, which recommends eating fish almost every day, the MIND diet says once a week is enough.  Poultry Shaiith Poultry is another part of a brain-healthy eating plan, according to the MIND diet. It recommends two or more servings a week.  Olive oil istockphoto Olive oil beat out other forms of cooking oil and fats in the MIND diet. The researchers found people who used olive oil as their primary oil at home saw greater protection against cognitive decline.  Wine istockphoto Raise a toast to the MIND diet: it recommends a glass of wine every day. Just one, though. Wine rounds out the list of of 10 ""brain healthy"" food groups that help protect against Alzheimer's: green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, nuts, berries, beans, whole grains, fish, poultry, olive oil and wine. Now here are the five food groups it says you should avoid to reduce your ris"	1
Heart researchers have long known that plaques in coronary arteries start out as pimplelike bumps but get waxy and hard and filled with calcium as time passes. Calcium shows up as white flecks in CT scans. The hard plaques are not the dangerous ones — it is the softer ones that rupture and cause a heart attack. But the amount of calcium in arteries can give a good idea of the presence or extent of coronary artery disease.  Dr. Krumholz and Dr. Khurram Nasir, a preventive cardiologist at Baptist Health South Florida, who conceived the new study, reasoned that research on heart scans had not been designed to help doctors make treatment decisions they face today.  Current guidelines have vastly increased the number of people who are eligible to take statins. Many people, though, are reluctant to take them. So, the investigators asked, could a scan identify those whose actual risk is lower than what was calculated?  The study subjects were nearly 4,000 men and women ages 45 to 84 and included blacks, whites, Hispanics and Asians who were recruited in 2000 through 2002. According to today’s guidelines, half had risk scores high enough that a statin would be recommended or should be considered. But guidelines then were more conservative, and in accordance with them, the subjects did not take the drugs. All had heart scans, and half had no calcium visible on the scans. The subjects were followed for 10 years.  It turned out that the actual incidence of heart attacks or disabling chest pain in those with zero calcium was half or less than what the risk calculator predicted.  For example, a person who, according to the current risk calculator, has a 12 percent risk of a heart attack in the next decade should take a statin, the guidelines say. But if that person has a calcium score of zero, the actual risk turned out to be 4 percent, below the 7.5 percent threshold for recommending a statin according to the guidelines and below the 5 percent risk for considering a statin.	0
"Say Aaa! Then Zzz: Tonsillectomy Helps Kids Sleep  toggle caption Maggie Starbard/NPR  Getting your tonsils out used to be just part of childhood — a rite of passage for children in the 1950s and '60s. Then it fell out of favor.  But tonsillectomy is back.  Today, the most common reason for the surgery is ""sleep disordered breathing,"" a broad diagnosis that includes sleep apnea and snoring. About 10 percent of elementary-school-age children snore.  Doctors say snoring can cause bed-wetting, behavior problems, short stature and poor school performance. That's a far cry from the 1950s and '60s, when tonsillectomy was used to fight frequent sore throats.  Back then, it was the most popular surgery in the United States. In the 1960s sitcom Leave It to Beaver, Beaver Cleaver was so impressed by his dad's tales of ice cream and pretty nurses that he schemed to have his tonsils out, even though he didn't need it.  Turning Point For Tonsillectomies  It was becoming unacceptable to just take tonsils out because they were there or you had a few infections. People were growing up with their tonsils.  The tonsils are two glands that sit at the base of the tongue and are part of the body's immune system. The premise of tonsillectomies, back in their heyday, was that tonsils get infected themselves and no longer help fend off germs.  Then doctors started noticing that kids were still getting sore throats, even after having their tonsils taken out. But it wasn't until clinical trials were completed in the early 1980s that there was proof that tonsillectomy really only helped children with severe, recurrent throat infections.  ""It was becoming unacceptable to just take tonsils out because they were there or you had a few infections,"" says Richard Rosenfeld, an ear, nose and throat doctor at SUNY Downstate in Brooklyn, N.Y. ""People were growing up with their tonsils.""  But growing up with tonsils can create another problem: snoring. Lisa Moran of Takoma Park, Md., remembers what it sounded like when her son ,Tyler Scorza, now age 7, slept.  Enlarge this image toggle caption Maggie Starbard/NPR Maggie Starbard/NPR  ""It was loud,"" Moran says. ""You could hear him through he closed door, down the hall, snoring, and he would occasionally stop breathing.""  At first, Tyler's pediatrician thought he'd outgrow the snoring. But he wasn't sleeping well and often didn't have any energy. The doctor recommended a head X-Ray, and the radiologist said that though Tyler's adenoids were enlarged, they weren't that bad.  By then, Tyler had been dealing with this for almost three years. He started getting frequent nasal infections. So his parents took him to an ear, nose and throat doctor. He said, sure, the adenoids are swollen.  ""But the real problem is the tonsils!"" Moran recalls. ""He showed us on the X-ray that there was a tiny passage between the tonsils and the back of his throat — very small.""  Enlarged tonsils (and adenoids) are the most common cause of sleep-disordered breathing in children. So the doctor recommended tonsillectomy.  Complications From Surgery  But Tyler's parents were worried about the surgery. It's usually done as an outpatient procedure now, but with general anesthesia. That's never without some risk.  ""Your child is under,"" says Moran, ""completely under. This is not a local.""  Other complications include pain after surgery and the risk of bleeding; about 4 percent of people have complications that require readmission to the hospital.  Despite hundreds of studies, there's still surprisingly little research on whether tonsillectomy really helps reduce the risk of sore throats. The operation continues to be controversial.  What's A Sleep Study? Sleep studies are a way for doctors to diagnose sleep disorders like apnea by observing patients overnight while they sleep. During a sleep study, the patient is connected to an array of sensors monitoring brainwaves, eye movements, heart rate, breathing and blood-oxygen levels. This information, called a polysomnogram, lets doctors see whether the patient has stopped breathing and for how long. Apnea in adults happens when 10 seconds pass without breathing; for children, it's a disruption of two cycles of inhaling and exhaling. Some patients can also use portable sleep monitors to record what's happening in their sleep as an alternative to the sleep study, but that approach is not as comprehensive. Many sleep disorders can be diagnosed without costly sleep studies, which can run anywhere from $600 to several-thousand dollars. More children are undergoing sleep studies as awareness of the condition — particularly in children — rises. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine says about 2 percent of children have obstructive sleep apnea. Before a sleep study is ordered, doctors typically ask for medical and sleep histories and a physical exam. — Eliza Barclay  No less a personage than President Obama dissed tonsillectomy when he was stumping for health care overhaul in July 2009.

Oct. 28, 2010 -- A University of Manchester, England, engineering professor has invented a portable breast scanner that could lead to more accurate tests for younger women without the need for X-rays. The scanner is based on radiofrequency technology, which is able to quickly show malignant and benign tumors when linked to a computer. It could be used in doctors’ offices.  Radio Waves Radiofrequency or microwave technology for breast cancer detection is not new, but what Zhipeng Wu, PhD, from Manchester’s School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering has achieved is the speed of results and portability. The patented real-time radiofrequency scanner uses computer tomography and works by using the same technology as a mobile phone, but with only a tiny fraction of its power. Costs are reduced and the electronics fit into a case the size of a lunchbox.  Breast Cancer Current mammography testing works well for detecting breast cancer in women over 50 with results of up to 95% accuracy. The Manchester team says it is far less effective for younger women, where the detection rate could be as low as 60% for women under the age of 50. This group, the team says, accounts for 20% of all breast cancer cases.  How It Works While mammography works on breast density, radiofrequency looks at contrasts between normal and diseased breast tissues. The breast is placed in a scanner cup and an image appears on screen. Tumors or other abnormalities show up in red. Wu says in a news release: “The system we have is portable and as soon as you lie down you can get a scan -- it’s real-time. The real-time imaging minimizes the chance of missing a breast tumor during scanning.” Wu says it will even work through a bra. “Although there is still research to be done, the system has great potential to bring a new way for breast cancer diagnosis.”  Reaction Carolyn Rogers, clinical nurse specialist at Breast Cancer Care in the U.K., says in an emailed statement: “Evidence is needed to demonstrate the accuracy and uses of this device. The most effective screening tool for detecting breast cancer is mammography and for women of all ages to remain breast aware, reporting any changes to their [doctor].”	1
NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A few short visits and phone calls with a nurse may be enough to help insomniacs get their zzz’s, suggests a new study of sleep-deprived older adults.  Researchers found that more than half of participants overcame chronic insomnia within a month of starting a brief behavioral treatment.  The key ingredient in the therapy, according to lead researcher Dr. Daniel Buysse of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, was a simple, somewhat counter-intuitive lesson: “When you are sleeping poorly, the most important thing you can do is spend less time in bed.”  Insomnia affects about one in every five Americans, rising to one in three among the elderly, and has been linked to a range of physical problems, from accidents to hypertension. Not surprisingly, it is also detrimental to mental health.  Three decades of research has shown cognitive behavioral therapy to be equally effective to a pill for insomnia, with fewer side effects. Yet the time and resource-intense strategy — usually involving between six- and eight hour-long appointments with a clinical psychologist - is not widely available and its cost, generally hundreds of dollars, is prohibitive for many.  Buysse and his colleagues wondered if the pill-free treatment could be shortened and simplified, providing more rapid results at a lower cost.  To find out, they studied 79 adults with chronic insomnia. Participants averaged 72 years of age and were randomly assigned to receive either printed educational material about sleep or the brief behavioral treatment consisting of one 45- to 60-minute in-person session, a 30-minute follow-up session and two 20-minute phone calls.  A mental health nurse practitioner in a regular doctor’s office focused the behavioral instruction on how to restrict time in bed and set regular sleep-wake schedules, while also discussing the biological rationale behind the strategy, including the body’s daily cycles of physical, mental and behavioral changes.  “This (therapy) has the effect of compressing your sleep into a more solid block,” Buysse told Reuters Health in an e-mail. “More consolidated sleep is more refreshing.”  Based on questionnaires and sleep diaries, the researchers found that two out of every three participants receiving the behavioral intervention responded favorably by the end of 4 weeks, while just one out of every four receiving the printed material experienced substantial improvement in their sleep.  The gap was similarly wide when the researchers looked at the number of participants who no longer met the criteria for insomnia: 55 percent versus 13 percent.  On average, for every 2.4 participants treated, one responded favorably and one overcame insomnia, report the researchers in the Archives of Internal Medicine.  These improvements were sustained for at least 6 months, and were backed up by data from a sleep monitor worn on the wrist or ankle. When the researchers looked at information from a different, more in-depth sleep monitoring system, however, they failed to find significantly better outcomes with the behavioral therapy.  The new results were similar to those previously published on the more intense cognitive behavioral therapy.  “A lot of insomniacs spend a lot of time lying in bed worrying about their sleep, among other things. They expect to have insomnia,” Dr. Thomas Neylan of the University of California, San Francisco, who wrote an accompanying commentary in the journal, told Reuters Health.  “Generally, the most expedient thing to do is just prescribe a sleeping pill,” noted Neylan.  But the drugs can pose problems, ranging from dependence or abuse to cognitive impairment during the day. And the risks may be even more pronounced among older patients, added senior author Timothy Monk, also of the University of Pittsburgh. Under the influence of the drugs, seniors may be more likely to fall and fracture a bone.  While brief behavioral treatment for insomnia is not yet generally available, Monk told Reuters Health in an e-mail that his team hopes their findings will be “an important first step in that process.”  In the meantime, Neylan offers insomniacs some advice: “If you’re not ready to fall asleep, don’t lie down in bed and try to force yourself to sleep. And if you wake up in the middle of night and don’t fall back asleep easily, get out of bed.”  “You don’t want to have any linkage between the experience of lying in bed and being awake,” he said.

ENLARGE The AirTamer A310 uses negative ions to repel pathogens and recharges through a USB port. Photo: F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal, Styling by Anne Cardenas  The Ache: In cold and flu season, pathogens spread when people are crammed into close quarters, such as airplanes and cars.  The Claim: Personal air purifiers worn around the neck clean the air in the wearer’s breathing zone of viruses and bacteria as well as allergens, say companies that sell them.  The Verdict: The devices helped clear a variety of test particles from the air in lab tests, but scientists say there’s no proof they have any health benefit in real conditions.  “It sounds like it worked in a laboratory setting, but that doesn’t say anything about whether it works in real life,” says Darryl C. Zeldin, scientific director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, an arm of the National Institutes of Health. Theoretically it is possible that the devices might help reduce transmission of pathogens, or ease asthma symptoms, but proof is needed, he adds.  Personal air purifiers work by emitting electrically charged molecules or atoms called ions, companies say. The ions transfer the charge to particles—such as one carrying a flu virus—in the user’s breathing zone and since like-charged particles repel each other, they are pushed out of the breathing zone, companies say.  The AirSupply Minimate from Wein Products Inc. in Los Angeles, emits positive ions and fits in the palm of the hand. The AirTamer A310, new last year from Headwaters Inc. in Marblehead, Mass., emits negative ions. It recharges through a USB port and holds the charge for 150 hours of continuous use, says company co-founder Troy Anderson. Both devices have suggested prices of $150.  In lab tests funded by Headwaters, the AirTamer was found to efficiently clear cigarette smoke, Mr. Anderson says.  In research partly funded by the company, Wein’s technology has undergone a battery of testing by University of Cincinnati scientists. In a study, published in the journal Indoor Air in 2005, a prototype of the Minimate was tested for removal of particles, including salt particles in a variety of sizes and a bacterium that doesn’t usually cause disease. It cleared the air of half of the test particles after 15 minutes, and nearly all of them within 90 minutes, according to the results.  The particles remain present on surfaces, “but at least you reduce inhalation exposure,” says study author Sergey A. Grinshpun, a professor of environmental health at the university. Since the particles used in the test were similar to the size of bacteria and particles carrying infectious viruses, it wasn’t necessary to use infectious particles in the test, he adds.  Dr. Grinshpun’s study appears nicely done, but doesn’t reflect real-life conditions, says Werner E. Bischoff, an infectious-disease specialist at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, N.C. In the lab tests, the particles are introduced only once and the purifier is given time to clear them, he adds, but “if you sit next to a person in an airplane, this person will sneeze and cough during the entire eight-hour flight.”  ENLARGE AirSupply Minimate emits positive ions and fits in the palm of the hand. Photo: F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal, Styling by Anne Cardenas  Colds and flus are transmitted not just by air, but also by people touching surfaces, Dr. Bischoff adds. It’s always a good idea to avoid touching your nose or mouth after touching the back of an airline seat.  The Cincinnati researchers also found the Minimate prototype reduced the concentration of “viable” airborne bacteria, defined as bacteria that grow well on a petri dish, Dr. Grinshpun says. It isn’t known exactly what causes the inactivation of bacteria, he says.  Headwaters’s Mr. Anderson and Stanley Weinberg, CEO and chairman of Wein, both say that while it’s difficult to test the devices for real-world benefits, customer feedback has been positive.  Scientists caution that the antibacterial effect could be caused by a gaseous byproduct of the device, such as ozone, an air pollutant. Both Messrs. Anderson and Weinberg say their devices produce negligible amounts of ozone. Mr. Weinberg adds that the Minimate has also tested negative for hydrogen-peroxide emission.  In 2006, a personal air purifier exploded on a Continental Airlines flight, according to a National Transportation Safety Board report. According to the report, the problem was probably caused by the user recharging a non-rechargeable battery; there were no serious injuries. The device, called the Fresh Air Buddy and formerly manufactured by Wein for another company, is no longer made, says Mr. Weinberg.  Whether you’re allowed to take an air purifier on an airplane depends on the carrier. United Airlines, which now owns Continental, doesn’t allow the air purifiers in the cabin based on the results of an “internal review,” a spokeswoman says. There is no Fede	0
"Many of these patients find themselves stuck with depression, cognitive problems, headaches, fatigue and other symptoms. Known as post-concussion syndrome, this phenomenon is often difficult to treat. Antidepressants can lift moods, painkillers can ease headaches and physical therapy may ease dizziness, but most researchers agree that these remedies don't heal the injury within the brain.  Could oxygen do the trick? A growing group of scientists and physicians say that hyperbaric treatment, which exposes patients to pure oxygen at higher-than-normal air pressure, may work.  AD  AD  ""These patients don't have enough oxygen to heal the injured parts of their brains,"" said Shai Efrati, a researcher and physician at Tel Aviv University in Israel and a leading hyperbaric scientist. ""Hyperbaric treatment massively increases the amount of oxygen available to the brain.""  But other researchers believe that the treatment has no merit and should not be recommended.  ""People want to believe that hyperbaric can fix [brain injuries], and it can't,"" said David Cifu, a researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, who has spent much of his career treating veterans with brain injuries.  Compressed air has been used by doctors since the 17th century. In 1917, two German inventors first used pressurized pure oxygen to treat decompression sickness, which occurs when undersea divers return to the surface too quickly. For the past 50 years, hyperbaric therapy has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for non-healing wounds, carbon monoxide poisoning, burns and decompression sickness. Over the past decade, doctors in the United States and internationally have begun using it to treat mTBIs.  AD  AD  MTBIs include sports-related concussions and head injuries caused by traffic accidents. Also, between 2000 and 2017, 308,853 American service members suffered mild traumatic brain injuries, according to the Department of Defense.  Patients with an mTBI typically experience symptoms that include headache, dizziness, fatigue, depression, anxiety and cognitive impairment. Known as post-concussion syndrome (PCS), this phenomenon is difficult to treat. Doctors use antidepressants, pain medications, biofeedback and physical therapy, but these strategies do not always work.  The nature of the human brain makes it particularly susceptible to chronic injury. The organ requires large amounts of energy under normal circumstances, and even more to heal when injured. And often, the initial trauma damages blood vessels that supply the brain with oxygen. So, just as the brain needs extra resources, it faces an energy crisis. Often, Efrati and others say, injured brain cells don't die, but may persist for years or decades, alive but hobbled. Hyperbaric therapy, he said, can return them to full function, even years after the injury.  AD  AD  ""Oxygen is different, because it has a direct biological effect on brain tissue,"" said Paul G. Harch, a physician in New Orleans who over the past three decades has used hyperbaric oxygen to treat hundreds of people with chronic brain injury as well as stroke.  Patients typically receive between 40 and 60 hour-long hyperbaric treatments spread over two to three months. During each treatment, they sit or lie inside a hyperbaric chamber, which varies in size from a person-size tube to a large room that can hold several patients. While in the chamber, patients breathe in pure oxygen, typically pressurized to about twice the density of sea-level air; in this environment, the lungs take in about 10 times as much oxygen as under normal conditions.  Researchers say it remains unclear how hyperbaric oxygen affects injured brains. Efrati and others argue that it probably works through several biological pathways. The extra oxygen appears to trigger the healing of brain cells, and switches on genes specifically related to brain repair. It increases the number of stem cells that migrate to sites of brain injury, promotes the growth of new blood vessels in the brain, and boosts the activity of mitochondria, which provide energy to cells throughout the body. Scientists have linked increased mitochondrial activity to healing in many kinds of tissue.  AD  AD  Efrati said the brain is no different from any other part of the body. Pressurized oxygen has the power to repair many kinds of tissue damage. ""A non-healing wound in the leg and a non-healing wound in the brain,"" he said, ""they are the same basic thing.""  Efrati came to the field accidentally. Eight years ago, as director of research at Assaf Harofeh Medical Center in Tel Aviv, he was asked to oversee the hospital's small hyperbaric chamber. He knew little about hyperbaric medicine and wasn't especially interested in it. But he soon noticed that pressurized oxygen seemed to have an unexpected effect. A patient had come for treatment of foot wounds that wouldn't heal — a common symptom in diabetes. The man had also suffered a traumat"	0
"The results of the comparison showed that slow metabolizers did just as well on a nicotine patch or the drug varenicline (marketed as Chantix), a drug that works on the nicotine receptors in the brain. But the patch costs less and has fewer side-effects than varenicline (including nausea, difficulty sleeping and abnormal dreams), so the researchers concluded that slow metabolizers should be put on the patch.  AD  AD  Normal metabolizers of nicotine, meanwhile, had more success with varenicline because they tend to rid their systems of nicotine faster, limiting the effectiveness of the patch. Varenicline contains no nicotine.  ""The slower metabolizers, they do very well with the patch. And they get no incremental benefit from varenicline,"" Lerman said in an interview. ""Why spend the money? Why have the side-effects?""  This may seem like common sense, but no one had ever tested it before, she said. And given how difficult it is to kick the habit, smokers need all the help they can get to succeed the first time they try, Lerman said.  ""Each time somebody fails, it affects their self confidence,"" Lerman said. ""The trial and error approach is not optimal.""

"Antibiotics Defeat Ear Infections In Young Kids, Studies Find  Enlarge this image toggle caption Gene J. Puskar/ASSOCIATED PRESS Gene J. Puskar/ASSOCIATED PRESS  Two new studies add substantial weight to one side of a long-running controversy over whether to give antibiotics to young children suffering from ear infections.  The ""wait and see"" approach has been enshrined in current guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics. It's based on a slew of studies over the past couple of decades indicating that most children with ear infections get better without antibiotics. Some researchers also worry that too many prescriptions are fueling resistance to the drugs.  But the new studies, from the United States and Finland, come down firmly on the side of early antibiotic therapy for kids under age 2 or 3. Both studies, which appear today in the New England Journal of Medicine, find these kids get over painful ear infections faster, and have less severe symptoms, if they get prompt treatment with Augmentin, an inexpensive antibiotic often used to treat respiratory infections.  But there's a big ""if."" Study authors and other experts say doctors should be sure the child really is suffering from an ear infection before writing that prescription.  Much of the confusion, experts say, has been caused by studies that weren't careful enough about the diagnosis. If many children in prior studies didn't really have ear infections, then it's not surprising the antibiotics didn't work for them, says Dr. Jerome Klein of Boston University, who wrote an editorial that accompanies the new studies.  But here's the rub – diagnosing ear infections in very young children, who tend to squirm, is not easy.  To do a correct diagnosis, says Dr. Alejandro Hoberman of the University of Pittsburgh, the doctor needs to be able to see the child's eardrum, which may mean cleaning out earwax first. If the eardrum is red and bulging outward, that's a strong sign of a middle-ear infection. The bulge is most likely caused by pus from a bacterial infection that needs antibiotic treatment.  ""It is a two- and sometimes a three-person operation to see the eardrum,"" says Hoberman, who led the US study.  Dr. David Spiro of the Oregon Health Sciences University is an advocate of the wait-and-see approach to treating ear infections. He coauthored a 2006 study that supported it. But Spiro thinks ""the pendulum will swing the other way"" – that is, toward immediate antibiotic treatment – because of the new studies.  So what's a concerned parent to do? Hoberman says they can cut through some of the fog by asking doctors if their child has the telltale ""bulging eardrum"" sign that indicates a true ear infection.  And, he notes, they shouldn't be afraid to press their pediatrician. ""How bulging is the eardrum? Is it really bulging this time? Or does it look like fluid in the ear? It's OK to ask the question,"" Hoberman said."	0
Parents of children with autism take note. It may be possible to predict autism in infants as young as 6 months who have older siblings with the disorder, according to a new study by a national network of researchers.  Infants in such families are at increased risk of developing autism, which is typically diagnosed when a child is 2- to 3-years-old and develops symptoms such as challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, delayed speech or nonverbal communication.  Researchers used magnetic resonance imaging — or MRI — to scan the brains of 343 infants when they were 6 months, 12 months and 24 months old. Two-thirds of the infants were high risk, having an older sibling with autism. The scans showed that 70 percent of high-risk toddlers diagnosed with autism at age 2 had an elevated amount of cerebrospinal fluid around their brains at 6 and 12 months, compared to toddlers who were not diagnosed with autism. Cerebrospinal fluid is a clear, colorless liquid that bathes the brain and spine.  On the right, MRI of a baby at 6 months who was diagnosed with autism at 2 years. The dark space between the brain folds and skull indicate increased amounts of cerebrospinal fluid. On the left: MRI of a baby who was not diagnosed with autism at age 2.

Excess brain fluid may be more than an early marker for autism, Di Martino said. It may also be a mechanism in the development of autism, and it opens up new possibilities for research, she said. “You can start thinking about conditions that might lead to increased cerebrospinal fluid.”  Shen and his colleagues are already looking for genes associated with excess brain fluid. Normally, the liquid, refreshed four times a day, washes away byproducts that build up in the brain. But if the fluid is not flowing properly, these byproducts hang around and cause inflammation, which could “hamper brain development” and lead to autism, said Shen.  Completely different mechanisms may be at work for kids without an older sibling with autism, said Shen and Dimartino. More studies are needed, they said.  Related: De Niro says 'find the truth on vaccines'. But scientists already did  Parents with children with autism should not rush to their pediatrician demanding brain MRIs for younger siblings, Shen said.  “We wouldn’t recommend that every high-risk infant get an MRI until we know that the accuracy can be improved closer to the 90 percent range” from the current 70 percent, Shen told TODAY.  He and his colleagues are working on improving accuracy by combining their brain fluid findings with other recent research. In addition to flushing out the brain’s garbage, brain fluid also delivers signals to the brain that tell it how and when to grow. In a study published last month in Nature, 80 percent of infants diagnosed with autism as toddlers had an increased rate of growth in the surface area of their brains in their first year, compared to toddlers who were not diagnosed with autism.  “We’re going to combine those two markers to see if we can improve the prediction closer to the 90 percent range, where it could be really clinically useful,” said Shen.  About 1 in 68 children develop autism in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, But as many as 20 out of 100 infants with an older sibling with autism will develop the disorder, said Di Martino.	0
Ron Wurzer for The New York Times  In a finding that challenges the conventional wisdom about the risks of some hormones used in menopause, a major government study has found that years after using estrogen-only therapy, certain women had a markedly reduced risk of breast cancer and heart attack.  The research, part of the landmark Women’s Health Initiative study, is likely to surprise women and their doctors, who for years have heard frightening news about the risks of hormone therapy. But most of those fears are related to the use of a combination of two hormones, estrogen and progestin, which are prescribed to relieve hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause, and have been shown to increase a woman’s risk of breast cancer.  The new findings, reported Tuesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association, come from 10,739 women in the Women’s Health Initiative study who had previously had a hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the uterus. Nationwide, about one-third of women in their 50s have had a hysterectomy.  The Women’s Health Initiative was begun in 1991 by the National Institutes of Health as a sweeping investigation of hormone use and other health issues of postmenopausal women.    While most women in the hormone study were taking combination hormone therapy, women without a uterus took estrogen alone or a placebo for about six years and were followed for nearly 11 years. The estrogen-only group was not given progestin, which is prescribed only to protect the uterus from the harmful effects of estrogen. Although all the women in the estrogen study stopped using the treatment in 2004, the investigators have continued to monitor their health, as is typical in large clinical trials.  The most surprising new finding relates to breast cancer. The women with hysterectomies who used estrogen alone had a 23 percent lower risk for breast cancer compared with those who had taken a placebo. This is in stark contrast to the higher risk of breast cancer shown in the estrogen-progestin part of the trial.  “The decreased risk of breast cancer in this group is something we totally didn’t expect when we started the W.H.I. hormone therapy trials,” said Andrea Z. LaCroix, the study’s lead author and a professor of epidemiology at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. “This study differentiates estrogen alone from estrogen and progestin in a very big way. I hope it gets across to women, because we are not reversing ourselves.”  Indeed, the investigators emphasized that the results do not change recommendations concerning combination hormone therapy for the two-thirds of menopausal women who still have a uterus. The Women’s Health Initiative data have consistently shown that the combination of estrogen and progestin raises breast cancer risk, and that the treatment should be used only to relieve severe menopause symptoms, using the lowest dose for the shortest possible time.  But the data are reassuring for millions of middle-aged women without a uterus who take estrogen to relieve hot flashes and other menopause symptoms.  An accompanying editorial in the journal was skeptical about the results, arguing that the design of the initiative, which is skewed toward older women and stopped all forms of hormone treatment after several years of use, does not match the way doctors typically prescribe treatment to women in their 50s at the onset of menopause.  Dr. Graham Colditz, an author of the editorial and professor of surgery at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said he thought data collected from observational studies that show a higher risk of breast cancer associated with estrogen use were more reliable than the data gathered from the Women’s Health Initiative clinical trial.  “The finding doesn’t reflect how hormones are used in the U.S. at the moment,” Dr. Colditz said.  The trial has, however, been held up for years as the gold standard for medical research, and its findings linking combination hormones to breast cancer and heart problems led to significant changes in the way doctors around the world treated menopause.  A major caveat in interpreting the new estrogen data is that the study used conjugated equine estrogens, which are estrogen compounds derived from the urine of pregnant mares and marketed by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals under the brand Premarin. The brand has fallen out of favor with many women who are choosing treatments that contain estradiol, which is chemically similar to a woman’s natural estrogen. It is not known whether the benefits of estrogen shown in the Women’s Health Initiative would be replicated using a different type of estrogen.  Nobody knows why estrogen treatment alone appeared to lower breast cancer risk in the study, but one explanation may be that in menopausal women with low levels of natural estrogen, the effects of estrogen drugs induce cell death in existing tumors. Nobody is suggesting that women start using estrogen to prevent breast 	0
Patients generally sit in front of the light box, which can be as small as 9 by 11 inches and 5 inches deep, with the bright light emanating from the square surface, in the morning. “With the natural dawn being later in winter, the body rhythms drift late,” Dr. Lewy said. “If you can fix the drift, you can fix the depression.”  Light therapy may even help with major nonseasonal depression, experts say, and with sleep disorders. And because it has few side effects, researchers are studying whether light therapy can help with depression during pregnancy and be used to treat elderly people with dementia. It is also being investigated for the treatment of bulimia nervosa, severe premenstrual syndrome and even attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and bipolar disorder.  Though randomized controlled clinical trials of bright light are difficult to do properly — one expert is fond of saying that it is difficult to “blind” studies of bright light — the American Psychiatric Association considers bright-light therapy an effective low-risk treatment for both S.A.D. and nonseasonal major depressive disorder.  A 2006 multicenter double-blind randomized controlled trial that compared bright-light therapy head to head with the popular antidepressant Prozac (fluoxetine) in 96 subjects found the two treatments equally effective for alleviating winter depression, though light produced results faster, usually within a week, and with fewer side effects.  Why, then, do so few doctors prescribe bright-light therapy? Some say their patients don’t have the patience to sit in front of a light for 30 to 45 minutes every morning. Moreover, “doctors are just more comfortable prescribing medication, because that’s what they do for everything,” Dr. Lewy said.  Photo  Some patients who suffer from chronic depression say they use light therapy in addition to their regular medication in the winter months.  “I’ve always seen a drastic change in my personality from spring and summer to fall and winter, and it got worse as I got older,” said Rick Bach, 54, a painter who owns a hair salon in West Hartford, Conn., and tries to spend every January in Puerto Rico.

View all New York Times newsletters.  No one knows exactly how light treatment works, but most experts seem to agree that the body has a master biological clock that responds to or is “set” by natural light fluctuations.  “Light does more than just enable us to see,” said Dr. Norman Rosenthal, author of the landmark book “Winter Blues,” who was among the first to identify and describe S.A.D. Light also has an effect on hormones, the body’s chemical messengers, affecting the brain’s hypothalamus, which is involved in regulating mood, energy and appetite.  “The hormone melatonin, which is secreted at night, can be suppressed by light,” Dr. Rosenthal said. “Studies have also shown that light influences serotonin and epinephrine pathways in the brain, the same neurotransmitter systems known to be affected in people with general depression.”  But while part of the appeal of light therapy is that it can be self-prescribed, using a light box is not as simple as it may appear. Experts recommend consulting with a knowledgeable health care provider before starting treatment to rule out other medical conditions and to help with monitoring and adjusting bright-light exposure.  Some patients may want to try simply getting more natural light to help with seasonal mood changes — getting out as much as possible during the brightest time of day in the winter, sitting near windows during the day or taking vacations to sunny locales in the winter.  If you choose to try light therapy, here are a few tips from experts.  COSTS Light boxes can be purchased for about $200 online; they are also available for rent. Some patients manage to get insurance reimbursement by having a doctor write a letter, but don’t count on your policy covering it.  PRECAUTIONS Side effects include headaches and hypomania, though experts say these are rare. Face the light but do not stare at the light. If you have an eye condition of any kind, clear light therapy with your ophthalmologist first.

Almost sixty years since the FDA approved the pill for birth control in women, a male version may finally be on the horizon. Researchers have developed a prototype male pill that appears to be safe in a month-long trial.  More attractive to many men than a long-acting injection or topical gel—both of which are in development—the prototype pill offers a “major step forward” in male contraception, Stephanie Page, a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle and senior investigator on the study, said in a statement.  The once-daily prototype pill suppressed certain hormones to the low levels you'd expect to see with effective longer-term contraceptives, results from an ENDO 2018, the Endocrine Society’s annual meeting in Chicago, abstract show.  See all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows  Philippe Huguen/AFP/Getty Images  The prototype pill—dimethandrolone undecanoate (DMAU)—is somewhat similar to the combined female pill, which contains estrogen and a steroid hormone. Rather than estrogen, DMAU uses a male hormone like testosterone.  Currently available forms of testosterone can exit the body too quickly for use in a once-daily pill. The “undecanoate” in DMAU, however, is a long-chain fatty acid that can slow the drug’s journey out of the body, Page said.  Eighty-three men took various doses of DMAU or a placebo for a month. Researchers analyzed the men’s hormones and cholesterol with blood tests at the start and end of the study. They found testosterone and two hormones needed for the production of sperm were notably suppressed in men who took the highest dose of DMAU.  While some subjects on all doses experienced mild weight gain, DMAU appeared safe. All participants passed safety tests including liver and kidney health checks.  “Despite having low levels of circulating testosterone, very few subjects reported symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency or excess,” Page said. There were no significant changes in mood or sexual function, but a minority of participants did experience decreased libido during the study.  Page has high hopes for the results, calling them “unprecedented in the development of a prototype male pill.” Longer-term studies are the next step toward a once-daily male contraceptive pill, she said.	0

"A patient's own heart cells can be used to regrow new heart tissue and help undo damage caused by a heart attack, according to early research published on Monday.  Scientists at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles and Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore were able to treat 17 heart attack patients with cells grown from their own heart tissue. Not only did this show that the procedure was safe, it also showed that the cells can help reduce scarring and even cause new heart muscle to grow.  When a person suffers a heart attack, he or she is often left with huge areas of scarring in the heart. Scarred heart muscle doesn't pump blood as well as it used to, putting stress on other parts of the heart to make up for the deficit. The damaged area also doesn't conduct electric current as well, leading to an abnormal heart rhythm, which can cause more problems. Heart attack patients often go on to develop heart failure.    ""This is the first instance of therapeutic regeneration,"" says Dr. Eduardo Marbán, director of the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute.  He says while nature abounds with examples of spontaneous regeneration of limbs or tissues - like a salamander's new tail or a human liver regrowing to full size if partially damaged - doctors have not been able to help patients regrow heart tissue. This could change in the future if larger clinical trials and longer patient outcomes confirm the results of this early research published Monday in the journal The Lancet.  Marbán and his colleagues first presented this research at an American Heart Association conference in November.  To qualify for this clinical trial, patients had to have suffered a recent heart attack and ""had to have a significant amount of damage to begin with and weren't squeezing [blood into the body] as well as they should have,"" says Dr. Peter Johnston, one of the study authors who injected the new heart cells into patients treated at Johns Hopkins Hospital.  A total of 25 patients participated in the clinical trial, which was designed to determine if it was safe to have cells grown from one's own heart tissue injected back into the heart. Seventeen patients received the stem cell transplants, while the other eight patients were given conventional post-heart attack therapy.  In an outpatient procedure under local anesthesia, doctors funneled a catheter into the patient's heart and removed peppercorn-sized bits of tissue from the part of the patient's heart that was unaffected by the heart attack. Using a procedure invented by Marbán, heart stem cells were isolated from the tissue and then millions of new cells were grown in a petri dish.  About four to six weeks after having suffered the heart attack, the patients had either 12 million or 25 million heart-derived cells injected back into the their hearts.  Marbán says when the first patient data came in, he and his colleagues were relieved to see the procedure was safe. After 12 months, researchers report only one patient appeared to have a serious side effect that may have been connected to the experimental cells.  Six months after the first patient was injected with his cells grown from his own heart tissue, Marbán says there was dramatic shrinking of scar tissue and new tissue had grown. ""That was unprecedented"" he says. ""No one had demonstrated that before.""  All patients were followed for six months and researchers have 12-month data for 21 patients. In patients who received the cell transplant, Marbán says about half of their scar tissue dissolved and the reduction in scar size appears to get bigger after the first six months. He says that why this is happening is still unclear.  Marbán says the amount of new heart tissue that grew was not subtle. [On average] ""22 grams (about .78 ounces) of new heart tissue grew,"" which he says is quite remarkable considering this had never been done before and the average weight of the part of the heart that is responsible for pumping the blood through the body is about 150 grams (about 5.3 ounces).  Patients in the control group, those who didn't get a cell transplant, did not regenerate any tissue and the amount of scar tissue they had remained the same.  Sonia Skarlatos, Ph.D and deputy director of the Division of Cardiovascular Sciences at the NIH’s National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute says this early research is very exciting and a move in the right direction. She cautions that this procedure has to be tested on many more patients and they have to be observed for longer periods than in the current study, but she says these results are all very positive. She is hopeful further studies will confirm these early results.  ""By preventing the consequences of a heart attack you may be able to prevent further down the heart failure that happens in [many of these] patients."" Skarlatos says.  She was not involved in the research but the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute did help fund it.  Skarlatos also says it's still not clear exactly what"	0

(Reuters) - Novo Nordisk’s (NOVOb.CO) top-selling diabetes drug Victoza cut the risk of heart attack, stroke and cardiovascular death by 13 percent in a closely watched study, but the result disappointed investors who had hoped for more.  The logo of Danish multinational pharmaceutical company Novo Nordisk is pictured on the facade of a production plant in Chartres, north-central France, April 21, 2016. REUTERS/Guillaume Souvant/Pool/File Photo  The stock fell around 5 percent in Copenhagen on Tuesday.  Victoza is only the second diabetes drug to show such heart benefits, after Eli Lilly (LLY.N) and Boehringer Ingelheim’s pill Jardiance. Victoza’s effect was evident across risks.  “To me, the impressive thing about this trial is the consistency across clinical endpoints and its robustness,” said John Buse, professor of medicine at the UNC School of Medicine, who worked on the study.  He believes doctors’ approach to type 2 diabetes treatment will now start to shift to a greater focus on minimising overall risks, rather than simply cutting blood sugar levels.  Because about half of deaths in people with diabetes are caused by heart disease, reducing heart risk is considered essential to their care.  But investors had been anticipating a bigger effect. Jefferies analyst Jeffrey Holford said market expectations had been for a mid-to-high teens percent reduction in complications.  There was also concern that Victoza did not appear to lower heart risks in American patients monitored in the study, despite doing so in other parts of the world and producing a solid result globally.  Novo, the world’s biggest diabetes company, had said in March that Victoza cut heart risks “significantly” in the study but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed on Monday.  Researchers told the American Diabetes Association’s (ADA) annual meeting that 13.0 percent of patients on Victoza died from cardiovascular causes or suffered non-fatal heart attacks or strokes, against 14.9 percent of those on placebo.  Deaths from heart disease were 22 percent lower in the Victoza group.  The Jardiance trial last year showed a similar 14 percent overall relative risk reduction and a 38 percent reduction in cardiovascular deaths.  The Victoza trial, known as Leader, had been designed to show Novo’s drug did not increase heart risk, so its superiority is welcome news for the company, especially as Sanofi’s (SASY.PA) rival Lyxumia failed to show heart benefits in an earlier test.  Victoza, which had sales of $2.7 billion last year, is the biggest seller in a class of drugs known as GLP-1 analogues that stimulate insulin production.  “I think physicians will look to GLP-1s with greater enthusiasm,” Buse said in an interview.  Once-daily Victoza is typically prescribed as a third or fourth option after patients have first tried various oral medicines.  “The significance of this is that now we can start to change the conversation around diabetes management from one of ‘let’s manage your blood sugar’ to one of ‘let’s manage your risk of complications’,” Buse said.  Mads Krogsgaard Thomsen, Novo’s chief science officer, said the results should encourage doctors to use Victoza earlier, since they could now see it offered “life-expanding” treatment.  The findings, which involved following 9,340 patients for a median 3.8 years, were also published online in the New England Journal of Medicine.  Gastrointestinal upset was the biggest side effect with Victoza. There were fewer cases of pancreatitis, which has been viewed as a potential problem, but more cases of pancreatic cancer, although the difference was not statistically significant.  Since 2008, U.S. regulators have demanded studies for new diabetes medicines to show there is no increase in heart risk, opening a new battleground between different treatments. Lilly is conducting a similar large study to try and prove the heart benefits of its once-weekly GLP-1 drug Trulicity.  The Leader study was funded by Novo and the U.S. National Institutes of Health.	0
Tech & Science  In the 1950s through the early ’70s, research began to show that psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, could be quite effective at treating mental health disorders like addiction.  “In the ’50s and ’60s psychedelics were the cutting edge of psychiatric research,” says Charles Grob, a physician and researcher at UCLA.  But at the same time, many of these substances were taken in uncontrolled settings by large numbers of people, and certain proselytizers (like Timothy Leary) advocated their widespread use. Then President Richard Nixon declared drugs “public enemy No. 1” and the so-called “war on drugs” began. All this combined to give psychedelics a bad name at the time and led to most of them being outlawed. For nearly a generation, science on these substances shut down.  Try Newsweek for only $1.25 per week  But that’s changing. In the past 20 years or so, a small amount of research has once again begun to focus on these chemicals, showing that they have promise for treating a range of conditions, from addiction to depression and anxiety, says Evan Wood, a psychiatric researcher at the University of British Columbia.  In 2006, researchers at the University of Arizona published a study showing obsessive-compulsive patients who ingested psilocybin had immediate and lasting reductions in problematic symptoms. The same year, Johns Hopkins University physician and researcher Roland Griffiths showed that in healthy volunteers, psilocybin produced lasting benefits like improved mood and peacefulness six months after ingestion. Study participants “made claims to be more sensitive, compassionate, tolerant, to have increased positive relationships, an increased need to serve others,” according to Griffiths. “Those kinds of changes are not delusional, because blinded interviews with family members, friends and work colleagues [confirm these reports].”  Similar work has shown psilocybin can help treat anxiety associated with cancer, at UCLA and New York University. Grob says work by his group and others has shown that psilocybin can help treat “terminal cancer patients with overwhelming existential anxiety, an area that traditional medicine struggles with.” And a study in late 2014 found that LSD permanently reduced anxiety in a small number of patients.  Wood says he’s most excited about research into using psychedelics to treat addiction, and he published a review on September 8 in the Canadian Medical Association Journal covering recent work in this field. One study from earlier this year in the Journal of Psychopharmacology found, for example, that 10 alcoholic patients given psilocybin in a controlled setting had greatly reduced cravings for and intake of alcohol in the months after the treatment. Another study, authored in 2014 by Griffiths and Matthew Johnson at Johns Hopkins and published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, found the substance helped people give up cigarettes. Twelve out of 15 patients in this small study had given up smoking six months after a psilocybin-assisted therapy session.  Ayahuasca, an Amazonian brew containing dimethyltryptamine that causes hallucinations and often intense spiritual experiences, has also shown promise in treating addictions, besides anxiety and depression, Wood says. Another chemical, called MDMA, the active ingredient in the drug Ecstasy, can help treat post-traumatic stress disorder.  Psychedelics generally are thought to work by allowing individuals to have a spiritual or “mystical” experience, during which time people can have profound realizations that permanently change their behaviors, Wood says. The idea that you can take a medicine one or a few times and become “cured,” or at least significantly helped, conflicts with current standard practices, which often involve taking medications every day for years, or life.  “With even minor mental health conditions like minor depression or anxiety...or more serious problems like addiction, the existing paradigm is to frame these as chronic, lifelong diseases” that require continuous medication with drugs like serotonin-specific reuptake inhibitors, Wood says. But not so with psychedelics, which represent “a total paradigm shift in the way that mental illness is treated,” he adds.  He points out that psychedelics should never be used carelessly, and that the “set and setting” (meaning the dose, mood, environment, company and surroundings) where a person takes them are of paramount importance. That said, when studied under controlled and supervised conditions, these chemicals have not been found to cause lasting negative health consequences, the Canadian Medical Association Journal review noted. All of which adds up to a compelling argument that psychedelics “should be the focus of intensive study for treating mental illness,” Wood says.	0
“These people are worried about lung cancer, and now there is an opportunity to offer them something,” said Dr. Mary Reid, an associate professor of oncology at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo.  But health officials involved in the study refused to endorse widespread screening of current or former smokers, saying more analysis of the study’s results is needed to further identify who benefited most. Such an analysis is months away. And they pointed out that the study offers no reassurance about the safety of smoking or the advisability of CT scans for younger smokers or nonsmokers.  “No one should come away from this thinking that it’s now safe to continue to smoke,” said Dr. Harold E. Varmus, director of the National Cancer Institute.  Photo  Patients wishing to get a CT lung screen will most likely have to pay the roughly $300 charge themselves, since few insurers pay for such scans unless an illness is suspected. The federal Medicare program will soon reconsider paying for such screens, a Medicare official said.  The study, called the National Lung Screening Trial, was conducted by the American College of Radiology Imaging Network and the cancer institute. It involved more than 53,000 people ages 55 to 74 who had smoked at least 30 pack-years — one pack a day for 30 years or two packs a day for 15 years. Ex-smokers who had quit within the previous 15 years were included in the group.  Each was given either a standard chest X-ray or a low-dose CT scan at the start of the trial and then twice more over the next two years. Participants were followed for up to five years. There were 354 lung cancer deaths among those who received CT scans and 442 among those who got X-rays. The $250 million study, which began in 2002, was paid for by the cancer institute and carried out at 33 sites.  Its preliminary results were announced days after an independent monitoring board determined that the benefits of CT scans were strong enough to stop the trial. The study will be published in the coming months.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The study found that for every 300 people who were screened, one person lived who would otherwise have died during the study. But one-quarter of those given CT scans were found to have anomalies, nearly all of which were benign. These false signals generally led to more worry, more CT scans and sometimes to lung biopsies and thoracic surgery.  “There are economic, medical and psychological consequences of finding these abnormalities,” Dr. Varmus said.

View all New York Times newsletters.  Deaths due to all causes declined by 7 percent among study participants who received CT scans, suggesting the tests helped to detect other life-threatening diseases besides lung cancer.  Dr. Claudia Henschke, a clinical professor of radiology at Mount Sinai Medical Center and a longtime advocate for use of CT to screen for lung cancer, said the study was likely to have underestimated the benefits of CT scans because participants were screened only three times. Had the screening continued for 10 years, as many as 80 percent of lung cancer deaths could have been averted, she said. Dr. Henschke’s research has been controversial because of its statistical methods and its financing, which included money from a tobacco company. She earns royalties from makers of CT machines.  “What we also have found is that low-dose CT scan gives information on cardiovascular disease, emphysema” and other pulmonary diseases, Dr. Henschke said. “Those are the three big killers of older people. There is just tremendous potential.”  Photo  But Dr. Edward F. Patz Jr., professor of radiology at Duke who helped devise the study, said he was far from convinced that a thorough analysis would show that widespread CT screening would prove beneficial in preventing most lung cancer deaths. Dr. Patz said that the biology of lung cancer has long suggested that the size of cancerous lung tumors tells little about the stage of the disease.  “If we look at this study carefully, we may suggest that there is some benefit in high-risk individuals, but I’m not there yet,” Dr. Patz said.  Since 46 million people in the United States smoke and tens of millions more once smoked, a widespread screening program could cost billions annually. Any further refinement of those most at risk could reduce those costs. Low-dose CT scans expose patients to about the same radiation levels as mammograms. Little is known about how the cumul	0
Researchers have long worried about the effects of psychoactive drugs on people whose brains are still developing. Photo illustration by Natalie Matthews-Ramo. Photos by Prudkov and Thinkstock.  It’s notoriously hard to treat depression in kids—the antidepressants we rely on to treat adults seem to be less effective and more dangerous when used on younger minds. New research out of Oxford helps confirm this and then some: The researchers’ meta-analysis on how commercially available antidepressants compare with a placebo showed that just one of the 14 antidepressants examined was significantly better than a placebo in treating depression in children and adolescents.  The only drug to pass the test was fluoxetine, sold in the U.S. under the trade name Prozac. It outperformed all other antidepressants in both efficacy and tolerability, a term that researchers use to mean how often patients had to quit the drug due to negative side effects.  Prozac is also the only antidepressant approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat depression in people under 18. That’s because the FDA has deemed that Prozac has demonstrated benefits that outweigh one of the suspected downsides of antidepressants in kids and teens: disrupting brain development. Dr. Andrea Cipriani, psychiatrist and lead author on the study, says these are concerns that practicing psychiatrists confront daily. “From a clinical point of view, we tend to be very cautious when prescribing medication to children and adolescents because of the unknown effects on the developing brain,” he said.  There’s good reason for this. Researchers have long worried about the effects of psychoactive drugs on people whose brains are still developing. Back in 2004, researchers at Harvard Medical School released a study that sought to answer questions about the safety of certain drugs and chemicals, including antidepressants, in adolescents. The study, which used rats in lieu of human children, found evidence that reward pathways are severely altered following exposure to drugs that affect the brain. Research on how antidepressants actually affect human children’s brain development is extremely hard to come by, given the limited numbers of actual children on antidepressants and the complications of gaining consent to study them. But other research on antidepressants suggest they negatively affect brain plasticity and memory—something that would be problematic while the brain is still developing.  And there’s another major problem with the use of many antidepressants in children: They may increase suicidal thoughts and behavior. Since 2004, the FDA has advised that antidepressants not be prescribed to individuals under 24 due to the increased risk in suicidality, especially during the early phases of treatment. Dr. Mina Fazel, child psychiatrist at the Oxford University Children’s Hospital, says, “It’s complicated, because you’re giving antidepressants when you’re very worried about that young person’s mood.” Essentially, the moment when it seems most necessary to prescribe the drugs may also be the moment when the patient is most at risk of suicide. Untangling this cause and effect has thus far eluded researchers, though there is some evidence to suggest that antidepressants spark a chemical reaction in the brain that does in fact increase the risk of suicide. So far, the FDA is erring on the side of caution.  A comment attached to the Oxford paper, written by Dr. Jon Jureidini, a child psychiatrist at the Women’s and Children’s Hospital in Adelaide, Australia, goes even further in decrying the use of antidepressants in kids. “Only if the discounted benefit outweighs the boosted harm should the treatment be prescribed,” he writes. “For antidepressants in adolescents, this equation will rarely favor prescribing; in younger children, almost never.”  To be clear, Jureidini believes there is almost never a justification for prescribing antidepressants to children or adolescents. I called him to be sure. “They’re not better than nothing,” he said, “and there’s quite clear evidence that they’re more dangerous than nothing.” He arrived at this conclusion after applying the customary dose of skepticism doctors are taught to apply when translating research findings to clinical practice.  His wariness of antidepressants being prescribed for kids, Prozac included, is further bolstered by the theory that these drugs don’t work well in children because they weren’t designed for children. They were designed for adults, and adults have very different physiological states than adolescents.  The Oxford paper notes that 3 percent of children ages 6-12 and nearly 6 percent of teenagers ages 13-18 suffered from major depressive disorder, the psychiatric term for what is colloquially known as depression. Given the U.S. population, that works out to more than a million children and adolescents. The disease manifests differently in kids: Whereas adults might report feeling apathetic, unmo	1
The spread of some sexually transmitted infections could potentially be dramatically reduced by instructing people who have had unprotected sex to take antibiotics within 24 hours after the intercourse, a new study suggests.  But such a strategy, which was tested in a population of men who had frequent unprotected sex with a number of male sex partners, could spark a controversy over the use of antibiotics and the general threat of growing antibiotic resistance.  “My message with that study would be that we need to do more research to prevent STIs — because that’s a concern. And this strategy … could potentially be used,” said Dr. Jean-Michel Molina, head of infectious diseases at Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris and the lead author of the study.  advertisement  Molina insisted he would never support long-term use of antibiotics to prevent STIs, but said that the approach might be an effective short-term strategy when paired with other control approaches, like more frequent STI testing among high-risk populations.  “I don’t want this strategy to be used widely in any person, clearly,” Molina said. “But if you can select a group with a high incidence rate of syphilis or chlamydia, and you want to try to reduce the rate of syphilis quite quickly in this group of people, you may think that this strategy could be used for a couple of months.”  Newsletters Sign up for Morning Rounds Your daily dose of news in health and medicine.

Privacy Policy Leave this field empty if you're human:  Rates of syphilis in particular have risen steadily in recent years; the rate in 2015-2016 — 8.7 cases per 100,000 people — was the highest since 1993, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. The rate of infection increased in every age group over the age of 15, in both men and women, and in all ethnic groups.  Molina’s study was recently published by the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was one of its funders.  The researchers randomly assigned 232 men to one of two groups. One of the groups was given antibiotics — the drug doxycycline — to take if they had unprotected sex. They were told to take two pills per encounter, and no more than six in a week, ideally within 24 hours and no later than 72 hours after the intercourse. In reality, the median use among the men was about 6.8 pills per month.  The men were tested regularly for STIs, and in the nine or so months they were followed, the rates of some sexually transmitted infections fell dramatically in the treatment group. The overall reduction of all STIs was 47 percent, but that average was dragged down by the fact that doxycycline doesn’t cure gonorrhea.  There was, however, a 70 percent reduction in chlamydia infections and cases of syphilis decreased by 73 percent. The authors noted, however, that the study length was short and they can’t tell if the strategy would work as well over the long term.  The results can’t be taken in isolation, others experts warned. Using doxycycline this way could drive the bacteria that cause the infections to develop resistance to the drug, warned Dr. Brad Spellberg, an infectious diseases specialist and chief medical officer at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center in Los Angeles.  Spellberg also said people who used the drug this way would be exposing the bacteria they have in their gastro-intestinal tracts — their own gut flora — to regular doses of doxycycline. And those bacteria too could develop resistance to the drug, leading to a host of other health problems.  “You’re causing friendly fire injury,” he said.  The full picture of the knock-on effects of exposing your gut flora to antibiotics is still coming into focus, said Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics, and Policy and a leading voice on the dangers of mounting antibiotic resistance. He noted a recent report in the journal Science revealed that some cancer immunotherapy drugs worked less well in people who had recently taken antibiotics.  Molina noted that antibiotic resistance to doxycycline has not been seen in chlamydia or syphilis, despite the fact that the drug has been used to treat these infections for decades. Still, he said the possibility it could arise cannot be discounted.  A commentary published with the study argued that reducing infection rates in men who have sex with men and who are highly sexually active might lower STI infection rates more generally in a community.  Authors Christopher Fairley and Eric Chow, of Australia’s Melbourne Sexual Health Center at Monash University, said pressure from patients to be given doxycycline on a preventative basis might be substantial, given that the drug is also prescribed in six-month courses to treat acne. Like Molina and his co-authors, they said STI preventive use at this point is premature.  Laxminarayan did not dismiss the notion of this type of use out of 	0
"After her mother unexpectedly died from a tear in the wall of her heart at age 63, Patricia Walters talked to her doctor, Leslie Cho, about how to better monitor her own heart health.  Pregnant at the time with her own daughter, Ms. Walters, now 46, says she was ""a nervous wreck"" worrying that she, too, might face serious cardiac risk.  As part of an overall health evaluation after the pregnancy, Dr. Cho, director of the Women's Cardiovascular Center at the Cleveland Clinic, recommended a simple blood test called hs-CRP—for high sensitivity C-reactive protein, which is a marker for inflammation in the body.  Easily done at the same time as a cholesterol screening, and covered by most insurance, the test is increasingly being used as a routine screening tool for patients with one or two risk factors to help assess their heart-attack and stroke risk.  Greater Accuracy  The hs-CRP test is a newer, more sensitive version of a standard CRP check, and experts say it can more accurately detect lower concentrations of the protein, making it more useful in predicting a healthy person's risk for cardiovascular disease. It measures CRP in milligrams per liter of blood: less than 1.0 mg/l is considered low risk; 1.0 to 3.0 mg/l is average risk; and greater than 3.0 mg/l is considered high risk for cardiovascular disease.  The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology both have endorsed the use of hs-CRP for ""intermediate risk"" individuals. And one major study suggests that even people with minimal risk factors in their late 50s and early 60s should have the test.  While inflammation is the body's natural response to a variety of physical states, including fever, injury and infection, research shows it also plays a role in a range of chronic illnesses, including cardiovascular disease. Inflammation of the arteries has been linked to heart attack, sudden death and stroke, Dr. Cho notes.  Those who smoke, have high blood pressure, and are overweight and sedentary tend to have high levels of CRP—and those who are thin and fit have lower levels. But genetic factors can also contribute to elevated CRP in people without traditional risk factors.  Research shows that elevated levels of CRP are at least as predictive of cardiac risk as cholesterol levels. A 1997 study of healthy physicians, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, was the first to show that relative risk of first heart attack or stroke was directly related to elevated CRP levels. And the Harvard Women's Health Study, which looked at 12 different markers of inflammation in healthy postmenopausal women, found that after three years CRP was the strongest predictor of risk.  Not-So-Low Risk  While some experts don't think the hs-CRP test adds much to current cardiovascular risk-prediction strategies, others say a large study known as the Jupiter trial supports broad use of the test to find people who may assume their low cholesterol levels protect them from heart trouble—and determine whether they might be candidates for treatment with statin drugs. The 2008 study showed that in patients with low levels of LDL—the bad cholesterol—but high hs-CRP levels, the statin Crestor reduced the risk of heart-related death, heart attacks and other serious cardiac problems by 44% compared with those given placebos.  Paul Ridker, a Harvard University researcher who led the Jupiter study, says, ""We know that those with elevated hs-CRP are at high risk even if cholesterol levels are low, and that statin therapy can reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in this group."" While the study showed inflammation contributes as much to cardiovascular risk as does high blood pressure or high cholesterol, Dr. Ridker says ""the core research question now is whether or not reducing inflammation per se will reduce that risk.""  His team has now launched two major clinical trials—one funded by the federal government and one by industry—to address that question. (Dr. Ridker is co-inventor on patents held by Brigham and Women's Hospital related to the use of inflammatory biomarkers including hs-CRP in evaluating risk for cardiovascular disease.)  Something to Talk About  Dr. Cho at the Cleveland Clinic says the test can help identify those patients at intermediate risk and open the discussion about prevention and treatment.  ""If you are 53 and chubby with high blood pressure and borderline high cholesterol but your CRP is normal, I'm not sure I would throw the whole kitchen sink at you,"" says Dr. Cho. ""But if your CRP was elevated, I would want to talk to you about the Jupiter results"" and discuss starting a statin. She also counsels patients with elevated levels about lifestyle changes including weight loss, nutrition and exercise.  Ms. Walters didn't have high levels when she was first tested, but they began to rise in later screenings. She now takes a statin and has her blood monitored regularly. She also joined Weight Watchers to drop a few pounds and runs wi"	1
"This Chef Lost 50 Pounds And Reversed Prediabetes With A Digital Program  Enlarge this image toggle caption Katherine Streeter for NPR Katherine Streeter for NPR  People who are diagnosed with prediabetes can delay or prevent the disease if they change their lifestyle and lose a significant amount of weight. But here's the challenge: How can people be motivated to eat healthier and move more? Increasingly, the answer might include digital medicine.  ""Just telling people to do things doesn't work,"" says Sean Duffy, CEO of Omada Health. If it were easy, there wouldn't be more than 80 million adults in the U.S. with prediabetes.  Omada has rolled out a digital program, delivered on smartphones and other devices, that incorporates all the ingredients known to help people overhaul their habits. It includes e-coaching; peer support; education; diet and exercise tracking; and electronic nudging. (Forget to weigh in or track your meals? You'll get texts or emails reminding you to do it.)  ""Week by week we have lessons on different themes, "" Duffy explains. ""They're interactive, and there's little games"" to keep it dynamic. Participants are matched with a group of peers (online) and they're led by a coach, who they can text or email back and forth with. ""We call it the symphony effect,"" Duffy says, because there are multiple methods working together to help participants stay on track.  Getting started  Sometimes fear is a good motivator for losing weight. Don Speranza is in his late 60s and lives on a farm along the Columbia River in Washington state, where he runs a bed and breakfast with his wife. He's also the chef at the inn. ""I'm immersed in food all day,"" Speranza says.  Last year he received an email from his doctor at Kaiser Permanente with some test results. ""It was like a gut punch, "" Speranza says.  Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Don Speranza Courtesy of Don Speranza  Based on his weight, which had been crept up to 210 pounds, and the results of his bloodwork to test his glucose, he was diagnosed with prediabetes. This means his blood sugar level was elevated, but not yet high enough to be diagnosed with the condition.  ""It was a real come-to-Jesus moment,"" Speranza recalls. He knew that diabetes increased the risk of heart disease and can lead to many other complications including vision loss and amputations.  When he signed up for the Omada program, the first thing he received was a scale. He began to weigh himself daily. He also began to track what he was eating. Each day he'd log his weight and meals and upload the data to a dashboard. His coach could see the data, too, and give him advice and encouragement.  ""Oh, my coach, "" Speranza says. ""I can't sing her praises enough, she was so responsive."" Even though they never met in person, they bonded. He took her advice and suggestions.  He realized, for instance, that he ate too much of the wrong things. ""Homemade breads and croissants, pasta and pizza,"" Speranza ticks off the list of baked treats with a mix of reverence and resolve in his voice.  Speranza realized he had to change his relationship with these foods. Temporarily, he cut out all these refined carbohydrates. He had to train himself to resist all the treats he bakes for his guests.  Instead, he began to fill his plate with more protein, vegetables and healthy fats. He raises animals on his organic farm, so he eats pastured meats, and a lot of salmon.  ""Week by week, I'd make one or two little changes at a time, "" Speranza says. ""It was a game changer.""  The weight began to fall off, and he started to move more. His coach nudged him to switch up his morning routine. He says he was accustomed to sitting each morning for an hour or so just drinking coffee. ""Now, I'll start the coffee,"" he says, but before he drinks it, ""I'll go outside and walk."" He tracks his movement withe a wearable electronic device. He began with 2,000 steps logged during his morning walk but has now increased his steps significantly. And he rides a stationary bike, too.  ""Now, I can almost keep up with my wife,"" Speranza says with a laugh.  Since last May, he has lost about 50 pounds (52, to be exact, but it fluctuates a bit) and his blood sugar has returned to the normal range. He no longer has prediabetes.  ""I feel so much better,"" Speranza says. As a baker, he buys flour in 50 pound sacks. ""Now, when I look at [the sacks] I'm aghast to think that's what I was carrying around.""  Success is not automatic  Not every Omada Health participant makes the progress they're aiming for. After all, pulling off these changes is difficult  ""I'm still on the journey to get to more optimal, health"" says Lonny Northrup, who lives in Utah. He lost weight while participating in the program, but when he hit a plateau in his weight loss, he felt stuck and he says he didn't get the personal support he would have liked from the program.

"By Alan Mozes  HealthDay Reporter  WEDNESDAY, Feb. 6, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- Enduring dietary wisdom -- that polyunsaturated vegetable fats are better for your heart than saturated animal fats -- may be turned on its head by a fresh analysis of a nearly 50-year-old study.  The reasoning has been that a diet rich in omega-6 polyunsaturated fats lowers cholesterol, and is therefore good for heart health. But an updated look at the study indicates that heart disease patients who follow this advice may actually increase their risk for death.  The original ""Sydney Diet Heart Study,"" was initially conducted between 1966 and 1973, at a time when the cholesterol-lowering benefits of all polyunsaturated vegetable acids (PUFAs) were touted with a broad brush.  But in the ensuing years, researchers have come to understand that not all PUFAs are alike, with key biochemical differences -- and perhaps varying cardiovascular impacts -- observed among multiple types of omega-3s (found in fish oils) and omega-6 linoleic acids.  ""There is more than one type of polyunsaturated fatty acid,"" explained Dr. Christopher Ramsden, who headed the re-analysis and is a clinical investigator with the laboratory of membrane biophysics and biochemistry at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.  ""And so, we were interested in trying to evaluate just one of these compounds, linoleic acid, by looking at this old trial using modern statistical methods, and also by re-including some original data that had gone missing from the first analysis,"" Ramsden explained.  The findings appeared online Feb. 5 in the BMJ.  The 458 male participants in the original study had been between the ages of 30 and 59 at enrollment, and all had a history of heart disease, with most having survived a heart attack.  The men were placed into two groups. The first group was told to consume linoleic acid, in the form of safflower oil and safflower oil polyunsaturated margarine, at levels equal to 15 percent of total calorie intake. This, said Ramsden, is equivalent to roughly twice the amount that Americans currently consume.  While omega-3 consumption was not affected, the men were also asked to lower their saturated fat intake so that it made up less than 10 percent of their diets. They did so by substituting safflower oil for animal fats, common margarines and shortening oils, salad dressings, baked goods and other products, according to the study.  The second group continued their routine nutritional habits, and both groups kept food diaries and underwent regular assessments during the three-year-plus study period.  By newly crunching all the original data the NIH team found that, compared to the no-dietary-change group, the linoleic acid group faced a higher risk of death, from both heart disease specifically as well as from all causes overall.  In turn, Ramsden's investigators included their Sydney conclusions in a new review of all studies to date exploring the impact of omega-6 consumption.  Despite the fact the American Heart Association (AHA) currently recommends that 5 percent to 10 percent of all calories come from polyunsaturated fat (principally from omega-6), the NIH team found no evidence to support the notion that linoleic acid confers health benefits. The review highlighted the possibility that boosting omega-6 consumption may actually increase the risk for developing heart disease.  Ramsden acknowledged that the Sydney study had been narrowly focused on a specific group of people: middle-aged men with a history of heart disease, who were asked to consume linoleic acid in quantities far exceeding both AHA guidelines and the dietary habits of most Americans.  ""So, yes, one of the limitations of this kind of study is always the question of its generalizability to other populations,"" he cautioned.  But he also suggested that his team's rigorous look back offered valuable insights into how nutritional science has evolved.  ""What to many people had at one time seemed pretty straightforward in the 1960s has turned out to form a much less black-and-white picture,"" he said. ""Polyunsaturates are not just involved in cholesterol-lowering. They may also be involved in inflammation, oxidation or clotting. So, it's a very complex picture. And though our goal is not to come up with diet advice, it may be that our conclusions will have important implications for nutritional guidelines.""  On that score, American Heart Association spokesperson Penny Kris-Etherton, a registered dietician and professor of nutrition at Pennsylvania State University, suggested that the controversy concerning linoleic acid is not new and will continue.  ""But I don't think this is going to change AHA recommendations,"" she said. ""Because there's very robust evidence showing the cardiovascular benefit of linoleic acid. The AHA science advisory board did not just look at one study or a couple of studies. There are lots of studie"	0
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Measuring certain proteins in spinal fluid can accurately diagnose Alzheimer’s and predict which patients with memory problems will develop the fatal brain-wasting disease, Belgian researchers said on Monday.  Alzheimer's disease patient Isidora Tomaz, 82, sits in her armchair with two chairs placed in front of her by her husband Amilcar Dos Santos (unseen) to prevent her from falling to the ground in their house in Lisbon September 15, 2009. REUTERS/Nacho Doce  And they may also help identify early signs of the disease in healthy people, the team reported in the Archives of Neurology.  “The unexpected presence of the Alzheimer’s disease signature in more than one-third of cognitively normal subjects suggests that Alzheimer’s disease pathology is active and detectable earlier than has heretofore been envisioned,” Geert De Meyer of Ghent University in Belgium and colleagues wrote.  They said measuring traces of beta amyloid and tau — two proteins associated with the telltale plaques and tangles that form in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s — accurately detected Alzheimer’s in 90 percent of patients with the disease.  They were also able to detect 100 percent of people with memory impairments who would progress to Alzheimer’s disease within five years. And they detected Alzheimer’s proteins in 36 percent of people with normal brain function.  The study is the latest to show that measuring disease-related proteins in spinal fluid is useful in diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease.  Currently, only an autopsy can confirm that a person has Alzheimer’s, a fatal and incurable deterioration of the brain that affects more than 26 million people globally.  Doctors diagnose Alzheimer’s by excluding other causes of memory loss, such as stroke, tumors and heavy drinking. They can also administer simple paper-and-pencil tests.  But biomarkers — proteins and imaging techniques — are helping to identify the disease much earlier.  Last month, experts at the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer’s Association proposed new guidelines for diagnosing Alzheimer’s even before patients have symptoms. [ID:nN13273900] These proposed rules included measurements of cerebral-spinal fluid.  In the study, De Meyer and colleagues analyzed spinal fluid from 114 adults with normal brain function, 200 who had mild cognitive impairment — a precursor to dementia — and 102 who had Alzheimer’s. They identified one protein signature that was associated with Alzheimer’s, and another that indicated healthy brain function.  When they looked to see how accurate these signatures were at spotting the disease, they found 90 percent of those with Alzheimer’s had the disease pattern in their spinal fluid. The pattern was present in 72 percent of those with mild cognitive impairment and 36 percent of those who were normal.	1

"En Español  By Karen Pallarito  HealthDay Reporter  WEDNESDAY, Sept. 22, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Routine mammograms account for only about one-third of the decline in breast cancer death rates, according to a large new analysis of data from Norway's expansive breast cancer screening program.  The other two-thirds of the reduction is probably due to such factors as increased cancer awareness, improved therapy and use of more sensitive diagnostic tools, the study authors suggest.  The analysis, published in the Sept. 23 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, raises new questions about the benefits versus risks of screening mammography and is already reigniting tensions over its frequency of use in the United States.  ""Women should be informed that the benefit is smaller than expected, and there should be a balanced discussion on the benefit and the possible harms of screening, such as overdiagnosis, false-negative and -positive tests and psychological distress,"" said the study's lead author, Dr. Mette Kalager, an epidemiologist with the Cancer Registry of Norway in Oslo and a visiting scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston.  ""This study will only add to the confusion for women and their physicians,"" said Dr. Daniel B. Kopans, director of breast imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital and a radiology professor at Harvard Medical School.  Last November, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force spurred dissension among breast cancer experts with controversial new guidelines for breast cancer screening. The task force recommended that women begin having screening mammograms at age 50 -- not 40 -- and that those exams occur every other year, instead of annually.  But some cancer organizations reject the panel's advice. The American Cancer Society still recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40, as long as a woman is still in good health.  On Tuesday, the American College of Radiology (ACR), the Society of Breast Imaging and the American Society of Breast Disease launched ""Mammography Saves Lives,"" a campaign designed to encourage women to have an annual mammogram starting at age 40.  ""Mammography is not perfect; no one has claimed that it is,"" said Kopans, a member of the ACR Commission on Breast Imaging. But since the advent of routine mammograms in the 1990s, the rate of death from breast cancer has dropped 30 percent, he observed.  ""That's a huge achievement,"" Kopans noted, adding that ""it may not be a big deal to an epidemiologist who's looking at huge numbers and doesn't take care of women with breast problems.""  Norway's breast cancer screening program began in 1996 and was expanded two years later, with staggered enrollment by county over a period of nine years. Since 2005, all Norwegian women aged 50 to 69 have been invited to have a screening mammogram every two years, the authors said.  For the study, more than 40,000 Norwegian women were followed for an average of 2.2 years. Researchers compared death rates from breast cancer among four groups of women: two that were living in counties with or without screening and two groups that lived in the same counties before screening was offered.  The difference in the rate of death from breast cancer among women in the screening group versus the control group was 28 percent. In comparison, there was an 18 percent reduction in the rate of death in the non-screened group versus the control group, the study found.  In other words, breast cancer screening was associated with a reduction in death -- but only accounted for 10 percentage points of the difference.  ""Our observed 10 percent reduction in death from breast cancer is much lower than previously thought,"" Kalager said. ""It is plausible that today, the effect of increased breast awareness and improved therapy have outweighed the effect of screening on reducing mortality from breast cancer.""  Both Kopans and Dr. Otis W. Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer, criticized the research team's short follow-up period -- just 2.2 years of observation, on average. They both said that the time frame was insufficient to assess the effect of screening.  In an accompanying editorial, Dr. H. Gilbert Welch, a professor of medicine and community and family medicine at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice in Lebanon, N.H., said the Norwegian study helps to confirm that the decision to undergo screening mammography is ""a close call.""  Welch, author of a book, Should I Be Tested for Cancer? Maybe Not and Here's Why, suggested that with better treatment and increased awareness of the importance of seeking care for breast abnormalities, screening mammography may be less important now than in the past.  ""That physicians are still debating the relative merits of screening mammography despite the wealth of data suggests that the test is surely a close call, a delicate balance between modest benefit and modest harm,"" Welch wrote.  But Kopans noted tha"	0
"A widely anticipated study suggests that hormone therapy started soon after menopause can ease depression, anxiety, hot flashes and other adverse symptoms that many women face, without increasing risks for cardiovascular disease.  There was no increase in breast cancer, stroke, heart attack or blood clots, but the study's researchers said the sample size was too small and the study time too short to draw firm conclusions.  The preliminary findings, presented Wednesday at a conference of the North American Menopause Society in Orlando, Fla., were in starkcontrast to those of the Women's Health Initiative. That much larger, government-funded study of hormone therapy was halted in 2002 because the risks of heart disease and stroke seemed to outweigh the benefits.  Those findings had sparked concern among women who turn to hormone therapy to alleviate the symptoms of menopause. The women in the WHI were older—on average 63 years old—and largely a decade or more past menopause, and critics suggested women closer to menopause might get more benefit with less harm. Nevertheless, use of estrogen and progesterone in the U.S. dropped by more than half between 2001 and 2009, according to IMS Health, a health-care technology and information company.  The new study ""will be reassuring to many people who were anxious about using estrogen for short-term therapy, particularly health-care providers who were nervous about their patients taking this,"" said Mary Jane Minkin, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Yale University School of Medicine, one of the study's eight sites.  The trial, known as Keeps, for Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study, was funded by the Kronos Longevity Research Institute, a nonprofit organization in Phoenix that conducts research on age-related diseases.  The four-year randomized, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 727 women aged 42 to 58 who were within three years of the onset of menopause. They received either a low-dose estrogen pill (one made with horse estrogen) or a skin patch (one with estradiol, made from plants but closer to what women's bodies make) or a placebo.  Women on estrogen also took a natural progesterone; the WHI used a synthetic form.  Neither type of estrogen had any significant impact on blood pressure, coronary calcium levels or atherosclerosis, as measured by ultrasounds of the carotid artery—key markers of cardiovascular health. Researchers speculated that was because the women were generally healthy and yet at an age where such problems are rare.  Women taking estrogen in pill form had an increase in HDL or ""good"" cholesterol, and a decrease in LDL or ""bad"" cholesterol, but an increase in triglycerides. Women on the patch had an improvement in insulin sensitivity, making them less likely to develop Type 2 diabetes.  Women on both forms of estrogen reported fewer hot flashes, night sweats and mood swings, as well as an improvement in bone density.  A second branch of the study, funded by the National Institute of Aging, found that estrogen in pill form, but not the patch, improved symptoms of depression, anxiety and tension, without causing memory or cognitive ability, which the WHI had found in older women.  Researchers said those findings underscored the need for women and their doctors to make individual decisions about whether to go on hormone therapy and if so, which kind.  ""A woman who has low HDL cholesterol and borderline high LDL and has some mood symptoms, might find some advantages on the oral estrogen, whereas a woman who has [high risk for Type 2 diabetes], some excess weight, might benefit from the [skin patch] form,"" said JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and one of the lead Keeps researchers. The researchers , who haven't yet submitted the findings for publication, plan more analysis on the impact of hormone therapy on breast density They also say they hope to continue monitoring the participants for any future effects on heart disease, cancer or cognitive function-whether they continue to take hormones or not.  Margery Gass, executive director of the menopause society, and who wasn't involved in Keeps, said it confirmed her group's view on hormone therapy: ""There seems to be very small risks for healthy women at menopause."" But, ""there is no strong evidence that women should be taking it long-term.""  Write to Melinda Beck at HealthJournal@wsj.com"	1
Images of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi often portray her carrying a coconut.  The symbolism has meant something to East Indians for thousands of years. And, increasingly, it resonates for Westerners.  Move over, pomegranate and acai berry. Coconuts are the new “in” food, touted by natural-foods enthusiasts and chased by entrepreneurs looking for a big payday.  “It’s a good time to own a coconut farm, that’s for sure,” said Daniel Fabricant, vice president for government and scientific affairs at the Natural Products Association, a trade association in Washington.  Fabricant said companies that belong to his organization, representing natural-foods retailers and manufacturers, are increasingly offering coconut-based products.  “You’ve got fiber, fats and oils, water-based compounds, and you’ve got the milk,” he said. “It’s a holistic approach.”  The fruit’s appeal rests, in part, on this versatility. A single coconut produces water, nectar, flesh, milk and even textile fiber. That translates into a broad slate of products. And in contrast to another natural substance that gets transformed into a wide variety of products — petroleum — coconuts are viewed as healthy.  But are they?  It depends.  Coconut water comes from young, green coconuts and contains a winning combination of electrolytes, sodium and potassium.  It is very healthy.  “It’s an effective drink for rehydration that doesn’t bring in the added sugars and the additives,” said Dani Little, dietitian for the Whole Foods Market on Pearl Street in Boulder. “A lot of rehydrating beverages have additives, whereas the coconut water — it’s super clean.”  Coconut oil and milk, though, are receiving mixed reviews.  The facts on fats  Coconut fat is saturated, like the fat in lard and butter. The healthiest fats, those found in olive and canola oils, contain more monounsaturated fats, which do not raise LDL cholesterol and might even help lower it. Doctors and dietitians have warned people away from cholesterol-boosting saturated fats for years. Coconut fats are not an exception.  “I’ve had clients who have added coconut oil to shakes and things like that, and their cholesterol has gone up significantly,” said Jessica Crandall, a Denver dietitian who is president of the Colorado Dietetic Association. “Saturated fat clogs your arteries and is not good for heart health. I was meeting with a cardiologist recently, and he said he doesn’t advise (coconut oil) for any clients.”  The fat issue is complicated by the types of fatty acids found in coconut, versus other saturated fats. While most other saturated fats contain “long- chain” fatty acids, most coconut fats are “medium-chain.”  This is advantageous for coconuts because the medium-chain fatty acids are broken down more rapidly by enzymes, said Little. In general, she said, fats high in medium-chain fatty acids are more healthy than those laden with long-chain acids.  In addition, coconut fats are high in lauric acid, which many believe acts as an antimicrobial, helping prevent viruses, fungi and parasites.  Even so, Little, a coconut enthusiast, doesn’t recommend loading up on coconut fats. Instead of buying oils or supplements, just use the whole coconut.  “What we tend to do with our food supply is take the positive and squeeze it into a pill or jar and think that will take care of everything,” she said. “If you focus on coconut oil, you lose out on the fiber and you are focusing on a concentrated source of calories. It’s the whole coconut that needs to be talked about.”  The coconut gold rush  Entrepreneurs are talking about the whole coconut these days. Some — those toiling to make money with coconut water — are worried about the coconut supply.  Coconut water “is much different from Red Bull or Vitamin Water,” said John Craven, the founder of Bevnet.com, a trade publication for the beverage industry. “If they want to make more, they just build more factories.”  Craven describes the race to turn coconut water into a big market, like iced tea or energy drinks, as something akin to a gold rush.  “Right now, coconut water is all the rage,” he said. “With the natural movement being in the forefront right now, the timing is right. In the past couple of years a couple of brands have figured out the right angle — electrolytes and hydration.”  Craven estimated the coconut-water market at about $100 million annually right now, but companies are doubling their sales year after year. By next year, he said, one company alone — Vita Coco — could do $100 million or more in sales. He predicted within a few years it will be a billion-dollar market.  Mammoth beverage companies like Coca-Cola, Dr Pepper Snapple Group, and PepsiCo have investments in coconut water. Grocers shelves add new coconut-water products regularly.  “Demand has increased exponentially, primarily in mainstream groceries like Walmart and Costco,” said Arthur Gallego, a spokesman for the New York-based Vita Coco. “It’s trickling down to the mass market.” 	1
Andrew Scrivani for The New York Times  Eating walnuts may reduce the risk for Type 2 diabetes in women, a large new study concludes.  Previous studies have suggested an inverse relationship between tree nut consumption and diabetes. Though the findings are correlational, walnuts are uniquely high in omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids, which may be of particular value in Type 2 diabetes prevention.  The scientists, writing in the April issue of The Journal of Nutrition, used dietary and health data on 138,000 women participating in a large continuing study of women’s health. Beginning in 1999 they collected data on walnut consumption, and followed the women for the next 10 years. They found 5,930 cases of Type 2 diabetes.  Women who ate walnuts tended to weigh less, consume more fish and exercise more than those who did not. But researchers controlled for these and many other factors, and found that compared with women who ate no walnuts, those who consumed 8 ounces of walnuts or more a month reduced their risk for Type 2 diabetes by 24 percent.  “There’s been a lot of research on nuts in general in relation to cardiovascular health,” said the senior author, Dr. Frank B. Hu, a professor of medicine at Harvard. “This is the first on walnuts and diabetes. Walnuts may have some unique benefits.”  The study was supported with grants from the National Institutes of Health and the California Walnut Commission.	1

"For those plagued with peanut allergies, protection may eventually come in the form of a patch worn on the skin, a new study suggests.  Saul Loeb / AFP - Getty Images  In the second phase of a drug trial, half of participants wearing the highest dose “peanut patches” for a year were able to consume the equivalent of four peanuts without reacting, researchers reported Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology.  It means that “they are not going to have to worry about traces of peanut in a package that came from a plant where peanuts were used or minor contamination of food in a restaurant,” said the study’s lead author, Dr. Hugh Sampson, a professor of pediatrics at the Icahn School of Medicine and director of the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at Mount Sinai.  That's a potentially life-saving development. Consuming even trace amounts of a food allergen can cause a reaction. About 15 million Americans have food allergies, including 1 in 13 children, according to the Food Allergy Research and Education (FARE) group. Eight foods account for 90 percent of all reactions: milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, wheat, fish and shellfish.  Trending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service  Unlabeled allergens are a leading cause of food recalls in the U.S. and the number of food allergy-related visits to hospitals are on the rise, according to the Food and Drug Administration.  The FDA recently warned people with peanut allergies to avoid foods containing ground cumin, after traces of peanut powder were found in the ground spice.  In the skin patch trial, the international team of researchers randomly assigned 221 volunteers, ages 6 to 55, to wear a placebo patch or a patch containing peanut protein at one of three doses: 50 micrograms, 100 micrograms or 250 micrograms.  At the end of a year, 50 percent of those wearing the high-dose 250 microgram patch were able to tolerate consuming at least one gram of peanut protein. The same dose worked for nearly 54 percent of kids, 6 to 11.  The skin patch — intended to desensitize patients to peanuts by exposing them to tiny amounts of the allergen — may be particularly appealing to children who are too frightened to try oral or under-the-tongue therapy.  “Many have been told all their lives that if they ingest peanuts they will have a severe reaction and die,"" he said. ""So it’s tough to get them to take it. With this you just slap a little patch on their backs.”  Although some volunteers experienced redness and itchiness at the site of the patch, there were no serious side effects. Just two dropped out because of flare-ups of eczema.  “The goal for most practicing allergists and for most parents is to get a child to the point where if there is an accidental ingestion of peanut it would not be as risky or life-threatening,” said Dr. Amy Stallings, an assistant professor of pediatrics in the division of allergy and immunology at the Duke University Medical Center who is not affiliated with the new study. “And the patch may be a way of doing this that is safer.”  The patch study's results are promising, although researchers need to continue following the participants for another year, Sampson said. It could be several more years before the patch will be available for consumers.  Researchers are trying to discover why food allergies have increased among children — the number of kids living with peanut or tree nut allergies tripled between 1997 and 2008, studies show — but there’s no clear answer. Allergies to peanuts and tree nuts tend to begin in childhood and are usually lifelong."	0
"April 13, 2010 -- Steve Peterson, 62, a home remodeler in Seattle, has rock-climbed in Tasmania, hiked in the high alpine regions of Washington, and trekked across the island of Manhattan -- all while sporting a knee brace due to painful knee osteoarthritis (OA), the wear-and-tear form of the disease that affects 27 million people.  When surgery failed to repair his damaged knee, Peterson's doctor suggested a knee brace. While Peterson was reluctant to try it at first, his wife all but insisted, and as a result, she got her hiking partner back, and to hear Peterson tell it, he got his life back.  ""It absolutely gave me almost immediate relief,"" he says. ""By wearing the brace, I could get back to sports and was able to call my physician and say 'why didn't we try this first?'""  Knee braces basically help realign the knee; taking pressure off of damaged areas to relieve pain and restore function. Bracing is one of a number of noninvasive ways to treat knee OA and/or delay the need for joint replacement surgery.  New research presented at a media briefing Tuesday in New York City suggests that Peterson is not the only one to find relief from knee bracing. In a new study, 49 people with knee OA aged 45 to 87 who wore a knee brace had less pain, stiffness, and disability after six months of use.  All study participants led active lifestyles before they got sidelined by knee OA, and said they hoped to return to their previous level of activities. And by and large, they did. Their quality of life improved, and their activity level went from one that did not permit recreational sports to one that did.  The brace used in the study was provided by Ossur, which also provided financial support to the study through a research grant and sponsored the media briefing. The study was also presented at the recent annual meeting of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons in New Orleans."	1
CHICAGO (Reuters) - Men who underwent heart bypass surgery and consumed about two drinks a day afterward had fewer subsequent cardiovascular procedures than those who abstained, according to a study released Sunday.  Light alcohol consumption was associated with a 25 percent reduction in additional heart procedures, heart attacks or strokes in the study by Italian researchers, presented at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association in Chicago.  “The benefit of light amounts of alcohol consumption has been documented in healthy individuals, but our analysis showed a benefit from light alcohol intake in post-coronary bypass patients,” said Dr. Umberto Benedetto, of the University of Rome La Sapienza.  However, bypass patients with a condition called left ventricular dysfunction who were heavy drinkers, defined as having more than six drinks daily, were twice as likely to die from heart problems, the study found.  The Italian researchers used a questionnaire to compare alcohol consumption in 1,021 men who underwent heart bypass surgery and reviewed their medical history for 3-1/2 years.  The study also found no adverse correlation between moderate alcohol consumption and any medication.  The American Heart Association recommends men limit themselves to two drinks a day and women to one drink a day, because too much alcohol can raise blood pressure and have other negative effects.	1
"Human growth hormone is a promising tool in treating cystic fibrosis, a new University of Connecticut study suggests.  Although HGH not a cure for the disease, which afflicts 30,000 people in the U.S., the researchers found that it reduced the number of hospitalizations among those who have the disease.  The study, published Monday in the journal Pediatrics, was produced by the UConn/Hartford Hospital Evidence-based Practice Center and was funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.  While the study offers insights on managing the disease, there's not enough evidence yet on whether HGH treatments could extend the lives of those with cystic fibrosis.  ""It's intuitive that it might be beneficial as far as length of life goes, but we won't be able to go ahead and tell that just yet,"" said one of the researchers, Craig Lapin of UConn's Department of Pediatrics and the Connecticut Children's Medical Center.  Caused by defective genes, cystic fibrosis affects multiple organs. Lungs are clogged with a thick mucus, which can lead to lung infections. The disease also affects the pancreas, making it difficult for the body to absorb food, which significantly stunts growth and often leads to early deaths.  The researchers studied cases of children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis going back to the 1990s who received an injection of human growth hormone every day for six months to a year.  In the 1950s, children with cystic fibrosis generally died before age 8. But with antibiotics and other medical advances, the median age for people with the disease increased to 37 by 2008.  ""As the kids with cystic fibrosis are living longer and longer, a lot of these ancillary problems are become more apparent,"" said C. Michael White, director of the Evidence-based Practice Center and lead author of the study.  In the cases studied, the researchers found that human growth hormone added 1.25 inches in height and three pounds to the patients. That growth also resulted in larger internal organs, particularly the lungs, making breathing easier.  HGH also appears to improve the mineral content in bones, making them stronger. There's not enough evidence that it prevents osteoporosis, a common result of cystic fibrosis, but White said the results are ""promising.""  For those who received human growth hormone, White said, annual hospitalizations decreased by half, from about three per year to 1.5.  HGH therapy can be expensive, but fewer hospitalizations should balance out the expense.  ""Hopefully, this is going to encourage cystic fibrosis care providers to use it more frequently in patients at the lower end of weight and of short stature,"" Lapin said of the findings.  A daily injection can be difficult for a child who is already taking several other medications, White said, but going to the hospital fewer times might make up for it.  ""I could see that, for a lot of kids, the injections would become just part of the daily routine,"" he said. ""They would probably be a lot less scary than hospitalizations."""	0
"A new study could change the way doctors treat patients at high risk for skin cancer. It doesn't involve any high-priced new pharmaceuticals -- the key may be an over-the-counter vitamin supplement that costs less than $10 a month.  Researchers found that a form of vitamin B3 called nicotinamide could help reduce the chance of skin cancer recurring in patients who've had it before. (Another popular form of Vitamin B3 called niacin was not used in this study.)  For the study, researchers in Australia looked at nearly 400 people who had had at least two non-melanoma skin cancers. They found patients who took vitamin B3 twice a day cut their chances of developing new skin cancers by 23 percent.  ""That's a dramatic number,"" Dr. David Agus, director of USC's Norris Westside Cancer Center, told ""CBS This Morning."" ""It could make a major impact.""  Vitamin B3 could help skin cancer patients  Dr. Jae Jung, a dermatologist at City of Hope cancer center in Duarte, California, agreed. ""If you can reduce the new skin cancer rates for these patients, it would be an enormous benefit,"" she told CBS News.  How does it work? Sunlight's ultraviolet (UV) rays can damage the DNA in skin cells, increasing the risk for skin cancer. Researchers say vitamin B3 gives skin cells an energy boost -- ""turns back on the immune system,"" in Agus's words -- helping them repair the damage.  Nearly 5 million people are treated for skin cancer in the U.S. each year, and the Skin Cancer Foundation says 1 out of 5 Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime.  The two most common forms of the disease, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, can usually be treated successfully. The most dangerous type, melanoma, occurs in about 73,000 people in the U.S. each year and kills more than 9,900.  One patient who could benefit from the vitamin treatment is Charity Wiese, who has been diagnosed with skin cancer more than two dozen times in the last five years. She said she's had ""quite a few on the top of my head, a few on the back of my head, one behind each ear,"" even though she tries to stay out of the sun. Wiese had leukemia as a teenager and underwent radiation therapy, which put her at high risk for skin cancer later in life.  Wiese thinks the vitamin study sounds promising. ""I am absolutely willing to try it and hope for the best,"" she said.  Doctors involved in the study are excited by their findings on vitamin B3 nicotinamide. ""It's safe, it's almost obscenely inexpensive, and it's already widely commercially available,"" Dr. Diona Damian, the senior author of the study and a professor of dermatology at the University of Sydney, told HealthDay.  But she said more reserach is needed to see if everyone benefits from it. ""It's not something we'd recommend at this stage for the general population,"" Damian said. She also noted that the benefits appear to wear off when patients stop taking the supplements.  Results of the study are being presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology later this month."	0
"Aug. 17, 2011 -- German researchers say that highly trained dogs are able to reliably sniff out lung cancer in human breath.  In its early stages, lung cancer has few symptoms, making it difficult for doctors to catch it early, when it's still treatable.  ""This is the holy grail,"" says Suresh S. Ramalingam, MD, associate professor and director of the lung program at Emory University's Winship Cancer Institute in Atlanta.  ""The whole field is focused on using something that's readily available that does not involve an expensive surgery or scan that would allow us to find early cancers,"" says Ramalingam, who is developing technology that aims to replicate the ability of dogs to smell trace amount of chemicals produced by cancerous tumors. He was not involved in the research.  Recently a large, government-funded study found that longtime smokers at high risk for lung cancer who received annual rapid computed tomography (CT) scans of their lungs cut their risk of dying of the disease by 20%.  But that test has caused controversy because it falsely detects cancer in about one out of four people, leading to further invasive procedures."	0
"En Español  By Amanda Gardner  HealthDay Reporter  SUNDAY, March 21, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- For the first time in humans, scientists have successfully used a gene-manipulation therapy to enter tumor cells and block the production of toxic proteins that are causing cancer, researchers report.  ""They're basically putting an instruction booklet into the cell saying, 'We don't want this protein expressed for now,'"" explained Gregory Adams, co-leader of the developmental therapeutics program at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. ""It's pretty amazing. It's potentially huge.""  ""This is something we've been waiting to see,"" he continued.  ""This directly interferes with the genetic mechanisms that promote cancer to stop the production of a particular protein,"" added Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. ""This is one step away from getting into the actual DNA.""  As reported online March 21 in Nature, this is the first time the process, known as RNA interference (RNAi), has been shown to work in humans.  The process of RNA interference involves putting two strands of RNA together to form so-called ""small interfering RNAs"" (siRNAs) and inserting them into cells. Once there, these interlopers cut the messenger RNA (mRNA) that is ordinarily used to make specific proteins. This discovery won the Nobel Prize in 2006.  But the work that nabbed the prize was done in worms -- a far cry from humans.  And there were other challenges, not the least of which was how to get the siRNAs into the appropriate cell and then make sure they did what they were supposed to do.  This team, from the California Institute of Technology (CalTech), devised a super-small nanoparticle system that, when injected into the body, would make its way to the tumor, deposit the siRNAs into the tumor cell and leave them to their assigned task.  This early-phase clinical trial involved actual patients with melanoma, a particularly virulent form of skin cancer.  The experiment proceeded just as planned, as biopsies later showed.  The researchers injected the cargo-laden nanoparticles into the patients, much as you would administer a flu or any other type of shot. They did not inject directly into the tumor as many other researchers have done.  The nanoparticles made their way smoothly to the target -- the tumor cell -- and cleaved the mRNA in just the right place, stopping production of the culprit protein.  The precision of the process is crucial to limiting side effects, the researchers said.  ""Now you can go selectively at proteins involved in the disease and not have off-target effects,"" explained Mark E. Davis, lead author of the paper, and professor of chemical engineering at CalTech in Pasadena. ""Normally when you make drugs, it's hard to say 'attack only that protein.' In this particular case, I'm going to go in at the genetic level and eliminate that one protein I want to eliminate.""  And unlike conventional gene therapy -- where the offending gene is replaced by a new one or overridden -- this therapy is reversible, said Adams.  ""This will run its course. Ultimately, it will restore itself,"" he said.  The authors believe the same system could provide a highly targeted, selective way to reach many different genes and affect tumors that have untll now eluded drug therapy.  Obviously, the process will have to be refined and optimized before it's actually used for treatment.  ""This is the first qualitative 'yes, we can do it' publication and it really has to be kept in that perspective,"" Adams said.  More information  There's more on RNA interference at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute."	0
"Scientists are finding more pieces of the autism puzzle of with the help of MRI scans of brain circuitry, according to a study published Thursday online in the journal Autism Research.  By scanning the brain for 10 minutes using magnetic resonance imaging, researchers were able to measure six physical differences of microscopic fibers in the brains of 30 males with confirmed high-functioning autism and 30 males without autism.  The images of the brains helped researchers correctly identify those with autism with 94 percent accuracy, says Nicholas Lange, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and one of the study authors.  ""No one has measured what we measured,"" says Lange of the MRI test he and Dr. Janet Lainhart from the University of Utah developed.  While previous studies using different types of scans have been able to identify people with autism, Lange says, ""no one has looked at it [the brain] the way we have and no one has gotten these type of results.""  Lange is quick to caution that this type of test is not yet ready for prime time. ""We do not want to give anyone false hopes that this is ready for the clinic yet. This method, this test, needs to be tried [and confirmed] with many more subjects outside our laboratory,"" he says. Plus, the research needs to be expanded to many more study participants and tried on younger people with autism and those who are not as high-functioning as the subjects in this first trial.  Using the MRI, the study authors measured how the water in the brain flows along the axons or nerve fibers in the parts of the brain that control language, social and emotional functioning. The scans revealed that the wiring of the brains of those with autism was disorganized compared with the brains of a typical person without autism. This is how they could determine which brains scans belonged those study participants with autism.  The study included only males between the ages of 7 and 28 because they were part of a bigger research project at the University of Utah, which is following males with autism for a longer period. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 1 in 110 children in the United States have an autism spectrum disorder and boys are far more likely to have this neurological disorder that affects language and social behavior – that number is about 1 in 70. However future studies will include girls too.  Currently there's no biologic test for autism, so pediatricians look to see if a child is meeting certain developmental milestones as well as signs and symptoms of autism. (The advocacy group Autism Speaks has posted videos to help parents see the signs of autism)  The earlier a child has been identified as having autism, the earlier behavioral therapies can be applied to lessen the impact of the disorder later in life. Lange believes this brain scans can be done on younger children, as long as they can go to sleep in the scanner – on their own, without sedation (because you can't move during the test).  Carissa Cascio, an assistant professor of psychiatry from Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, who specializes in autism and neuro-imaging, believes these study results are important. But she cautions that using this method as a true diagnostic tool to detect autism in a child is ""a long way off."" ""What this paper seems to be doing is taking the first steps towards parlaying what we are able to glean from brain imaging into potential diagnostic tools.""  Zachary Warren, who is the director of the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center Treatment and Research Institute for Autism Spectrum Disorders (TRIAD), says since there are many types of autism, ""it becomes very challenging to capture all these differences with one test."" Still he believes this is new study can help pinpoint the earliest markers of concern in developing brains."	0
Strobe lighting has been shown to reduce levels of the toxic proteins seen in Alzheimer’s disease, in findings that raise the tantalising possibility of future non-invasive treatments for the disease.  The study, in mice, found that exposure to flickering light stimulated brain waves, called gamma oscillations, that are known to be disturbed in Alzheimer’s patients. Boosting this synchronous brain activity appeared to act as a cue for the brain’s immune cells, prompting them to absorb the sticky amyloid proteins that are the most visible hallmarks of the disease in the brain’s of people with Alzheimer’s.  The authors caution that a “big if” remains over whether the findings would be replicated in humans – and whether cognitive deficits as well as visible symptoms of the disease would be improved.  “If humans behave similarly to mice in response to this treatment, I would say the potential is just enormous, because it’s so non-invasive, and it’s so accessible,” said Li-Huei Tsai, director of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at MIT, and the paper’s senior author.  Alzheimer’s research has faced a number of major setbacks – most recently the failure of Eli Lily’s drug trial – after promising results in rodents did not translate into clinical improvements for patients.  The latest intervention, scientists predict, should be quicker and cheaper to confirm in humans than pharmaceuticals, which typically take more than a decade to develop and assess for safety before the clinical efficacy is even examined.  The study, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, hinges on the observation that Alzheimer’s patients show a loss of synchronised brain activity, known as gamma oscillations, which is linked to attention and memory.    To restore the activity, the scientists first used mice that had been genetically engineered such that the neurons that generate gamma activity in the brain were sensitive to light. The technique, known as optogenetics, allowed the scientists to artificially cause groups of neurons to fire in unison by pulsing light into the brains of the mice.    After an hour of stimulation, the researchers found a roughly 50% reduction in the levels of beta amyloid proteins in the hippocampus, the brain’s memory centre. Closer inspection showed that the amyloid had been taken up by microglia, the brain’s immune cells.  In a healthy brain, microglia act as chemical rubbish collectors, surveying the local environment, clearing up unwanted compounds, but in Alzheimer’s these cells can lose this function and switch into an inflammatory state in which they secrete toxic compounds instead. Strengthening gamma oscillations appeared to switch the microglia back into a productive state.  Next, the scientist showed that gamma oscillations could also be stimulated non-invasively in the visual brain region simply by exposing the mice to a flickering light. At 40Hz the flicker of the light is barely discernible and would be “not offensive at all” for a person to have in the background.  After being given one hour of flickering light each day for a week, the scientists saw a 60% reduction of harmful amyloid plaques in the brains of the mice.  Ed Mann, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Oxford, said: “I was surprised, and it’s exciting, that such a simple stimulus can target a molecular pathway and have such an effect in an hour.”  Questions remain, however, about whether boosting gamma oscillations and sweeping amyloid plaques out of the visual brain region would help with memory, which is centred in the hippocampus, or broader cognitive abilities.  David Reynolds, chief scientific officer at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “It is conceivable that changing brain cell rhythms could be a future target for therapies, but researchers will need to explore how light flickering approaches could not only reduce amyloid in the visual area of the brain but in those areas more commonly affected in Alzheimer’s.”  The authors suggest that it may be possible to take a multi-sensory approach, using a combination of flashing lights and vibrating chairs. Tsai and Ed Boyden, a colleague at MIT and co-author, have started a company called Cognito Therapeutics to pursue tests in humans.  There are 850,000 people with dementia in Britain and this figure is expected to reach 1 million by 2025. Earlier this year, dementia overtook heart disease as the leading cause of death in England and Wales.	1
"By Amanda Gardner  HealthDay Reporter  MONDAY, July 2, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Men may one day have a birth-control option other than the condom or vasectomy -- if early research on a new contraceptive gel pans out.  Preliminary findings suggest that when applied to the skin, the gel dramatically lowers sperm counts, thus also lowering -- though not eliminating -- the risk for pregnancy.  This is the first time that a combination of testosterone and a synthetic progestin called Nestorone has been tested as a gel that could be applied topically. Previous research involved administering the combination by injection or via a patch, said study senior author Dr. Christina Wang, a professor of medicine at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute.  The combination contraceptive needs to undergo further testing before it is commercially available.  Although men have sometimes received a bad rap for not being willing to assume responsibility for birth control, Dr. Joseph Alukal, an assistant professor of urology at NYU Langone Medical Center, in New York City, thinks this reputation may be somewhat undeserved.  ""I think [men] would use it more than is realized,"" said Alukal, who was not involved in the new research. ""Plenty of guys are concerned about unwanted pregnancy, almost as much as women.""  Unfortunately, condoms and vasectomy have remained the only commercially available contraception options for men.  The results of the study, funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development, were presented at the recent Endocrine Society annual meeting, held in Houston.  According to Wang, the gel was applied in two spots -- the testosterone component on the arm and the progestin component on the abdomen. The gels were applied every day for six months.  The study, conducted in conjunction with the University of Washington, involved 56 men who were assigned to receive one of three types of gels: one gel containing both testosterone plus a gel containing one of two doses of the synthetic progestin; or a gel containing testosterone on its own plus a ""placebo"" gel with no progestin.  Up to 89 percent of the men who received the combination formulas saw their sperm concentrations plunge to less than 1 million sperm per milliliter, versus just 23 percent of those receiving only testosterone.  Normal sperm concentration is more than 15 million sperm per milliliter, according to the Mayo Clinic's website.  Up to 78 percent of men receiving the drug combination in the study saw their concentrations drop to no sperm at all, versus only 23 percent of men taking testosterone alone.  The testosterone/progestin combination works by shutting off the hormones that control production of sperm in the testes, Wang explained.  One important and unanswered question is what the long-term side effects of this regimen might be.  The answer, said Wang, is ""We just don't know.""  That's apart from mild-to-moderate acne or an increase in acne, which was seen in about 21 percent of participants.  A new formulation currently being developed that contains half the amount of testosterone might decrease or eliminate that problem, Wang speculated.  Another question is how reversible this would be in terms of restoring sperm counts, Alukal said.  In addition to planning more studies on this combination protocol, Wang is also in early phases of testing the male hormone dimethandrolone, which is more potent than testosterone.  Because the new study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.  More information  There's more on contraception at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists."	0
NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - There is never a good time to have a stroke, but a new study suggests that a person who suffers a stroke on a weekend is more apt to get clot-busting therapy on arrival at the hospital than a person who suffers a stroke on a weekday.  Nonetheless, the odds of survival are about the same for weekend and weekday admission for stroke, the study found.  Stroke requires emergency treatment and for those suffering a stroke on a Saturday or Sunday, “waiting until Monday for aggressive treatment is not an option,” Dr. Abby S. Kazley and colleagues from the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston emphasize in a report released today.  “Anyone who thinks they are having a stroke should seek care at a hospital immediately. Individuals should not wait to seek care for stroke,” Kazley told Reuters Health by email.  The current study, she added, shows that “high quality (stroke) care is available in hospitals on the weekends and weekdays.” In fact, care might even be more aggressive on weekends.  Why? On weekends, even though hospitals have lower levels of staffing, stroke patients arriving at the hospital may have greater access to equipment and doctors who might be busier during the week than they are on weekends. Elective surgeries are not usually scheduled on weekends, leading perhaps to “decreased traffic and waiting times” for diagnostic equipment, culminating in quicker and more efficient diagnosis and determination of treatment.  With less road traffic and job obligations on weekends, stroke patients may get to the hospital quicker — within the three hour window when guidelines recommend that clot-busting drugs for stroke be given.  Kazley and colleagues analyzed data on 78,657 patients admitted to Virginia hospitals between 1998 and 2006 with acute ischemic stroke — the most common type of stroke, which is caused by a blood clot in the vessels supplying the brain. Of these, 20,279 were admitted on weekends and 58,378 during the week.  Patients admitted on the weekends were 20 percent more likely than those admitted during the week to get the clot-busting drug tissue plasminogen activator, or tPA — a drug that can improve patient outcomes following stroke. A total of 543 weekend stroke sufferers got the drug versus only 229 weekday stroke patients.  Yet stroke patients admitted on the weekends were no more likely to die than stroke patients admitted during the week: 1,420 patients admitted on the weekend died versus 3,993 patients admitted on a weekday, which worked out to roughly the same rate of death.  Putting those figures together could suggest that the clot-buster tPA wasn’t doing much good. In fact, that authors note that patients who received tPA were more likely to die in the hospital. Dr. Lawrence B. Goldstein, director of the Duke Stroke Center in Durham, North Carolina, and spokesperson for the American Heart Association said the results were not surprising, since “no clinical trials ever showed that treatment with a (clot buster) improves survival.”  But Kazley said that the additional deaths among patients who received tPA is likely because doctors are more likely to give the drug to those with severe strokes, who have a higher risk of death in any case.  Overall, Kazley added, this study offers “good news that indicates that the quality of care is similar regardless of when patients present at the hospital for treatment. This is an indication of the standardization of hospital care regardless of the time/day that patients seek care.”  Studies on the potential for a “weekender effect” in care and outcome for urgent conditions such stroke and heart attack have yielded mixed results.  For example, in one study examining stroke outcomes in Canada, researchers found that patients with stroke admitted to the hospital on weekends were at greater risk of dying than those admitted on weekdays. “Even in a country with universal health insurance coverage (such as Canada), disparities in resources, expertise, or the number of healthcare providers working during weekends” may affect the stroke mortality rate, the researchers concluded. (See Reuters Health report, March 8, 2007).  In a prior US study, researchers found that people who were admitted to the hospital on a weekend for a heart attack were less likely to receive potentially life-saving procedures than their peers who were admitted on a weekday. In this study, weekend admissions for heart attack were associated with much higher death rates, leading the researchers to conclude that more appropriate hospital staffing or regionalized care of heart attack patients may prevent some of these deaths.

"When U.S. Marine Chris Merkle returned from his last tour of duty in Afghanistan, his family was thrilled to have him back.  But for Merkle, the welcome home was also accompanied by some dark problems. He couldn’t sleep. He was irritable and had anger issues. He would avoid certain stressful situations, like driving in traffic. And he would stay on high alert in the classroom.  “And then soon, they’re like, 'You’re not the same,'” Merkle recalled of what his family told him. “They start to notice that you’re not really enjoying the parties of our friends. You only get really excited when you're going to visit former Marines and the people you used to hang out with.”  Chris Merkle  Merkle served three tours in Iraq and four in Afghanistan. Re-adjusting to being a civilian was tough, he said, and he was finding it difficult to function.  “There was almost 5, 10 years of deploying back and forth back and forth -- there was this void, this monster in the room that’s not talked about until finally it came out. It was like, 'You need to see somebody. Something is going on with you.'""  While Merkle was a patient at the VA, he heard of a clinical psychologist named Skip Rizzo at the University of Southern California Institute of Creative Technologies. Merkle was trying traditional one-on-one therapy and said that at the time, “it wasn’t really taking that well.” He was looking for an alternative and heard about Skip’s research that used a new and unexpected way to treat post-traumatic stress disorder -- with virtual reality.  ABC News  “Finding the Next” full episodes will release Tuesdays on ABCNews.com and ABC News' mobile apps. The entire series is available now on ABC News apps on Apple TV, Roku and Xbox One.  Nearly 8 million adults suffer from PTSD during a given year, according to the National Center for PTSD. The condition can occur after someone has been exposed to a significant stressor and often includes symptoms such as avoidance, hyper-vigilance, anger issues and mood swings. One common method for treatment is called “exposure therapy.” The patient recounts their trauma, visualizing it in their imagination, and narrates it to a clinician. By repeatedly confronting and processing the trauma, the brain can start to reduce the level of anxiety and response to those memories.  That’s exactly the approach Rizzo uses with virtual reality therapy.  “My mission is to drag psychology kicking and screaming into the 21st century,” Rizzo said, noting that virtual reality offers a unique opportunity for clinicians and clients alike: to be immersed in the environment that evokes the original trauma, rather than relying on the patient’s imagination.  Rizzo has created 14 virtual “worlds” for patients, and clinicians can add custom elements, including helicopters, clouds, small-arms fire and missiles.  USC Institute for Creative Technologies  “The first thing to keep in mind is that we are never going to replicate an exact simulation of what the patient went through,” Rizzo said. “But we really don’t need to.”  Merkle explained how the virtual reality experience works. “Your brain assumes, 'OK, this must be where we’re at,' and it fills in the blanks. And as you’re talking through it, you feel like you’re physically there.”  Each session lasts for about an hour and a half, and the patient speaks about their experience with a clinician as they go through the virtual simulation.  For Merkle, virtual reality allowed him to start unlocking memories and work through his trauma.  “So, it really allowed me to open the door and begin my healing process,” he said. “I’m still a work in process obviously but I’m so far forward, leaps and bound beyond where I would have been without virtual reality.”  For more stories from our “Finding the Next” series, hit the bell in ABC News’ phone app. Download ABC News for iPhone here or ABC News for Android here."	1
"About 800,000 people in the United States suffer from a stroke each year. Of those who survive, about 70 percent will be left disabled, making the cardiac event a major cause of adult disability. While there are therapies to help improve patients' mobility, they’re only effective within the first few hours of an event.  Recently, researchers from the Stanford University School of Medicine have made it their mission to improve these outcomes. They hypothesized that injecting stem cells into the brains of chronic stroke patients would increase their survival rates. And in a clinical trial testing the technique, researchers found injections can safely improve patients' motor function.  “What surprised us most was the remarkable recovery some patients had,” Dr. Gary Steinberg, professor and chair of neurosurgery at Stanford, told Medical Daily, “While we had hoped for that, we didn’t really expect it. Patients recover from strokes over the first six months, and then there’s very little recovery [after that]. You know, they go to rehab and there’s not much more [more] they can recover usually.”  For the study, Steinberg and his team recruited 18 patients who had suffered their first and only stroke six months to three years prior to the trial. Each patient had a small hole drilled through their skulls in order for researchers to be able to inject stem cells taken from the bone marrow of two donors directly into parts of their brains that were damaged from stroke. After patients were sent home, researchers continued to monitor their health through blood tests, clinical evaluations, and brain imaging.  Results showed that the implanted stem cells didn’t survive very long in the brain, disappearing about one to two months after injections; however, patients still showed significant motor recovery at six and 12 months post-surgery. Some of the patients bound to wheelchairs were even able to walk again.  “The recovery some patients showed was not just minimal, it was significant,” said Steinberg, who has researched stem cell therapies for more than 15 years. “It wasn’t just someone who couldn’t move their thumb now being able to move their thumb, [it was more profound than that].""  The types of stem cells used, called mesenchymal stem cells, can differentiate into a variety of cell types. In other words, they are the precursors to muscle, fat, bone, and tendon tissue. Past research has shown that these cells can be used to treat the effects of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, brain damage caused by loss of oxygen.  In Steinberg's study, it did not “cause problems by differentiating into unwanted tissues or forming tumors.” And even when the stem cells came from an unrelated donor, the participants did not experience a strong immune reaction. Although more than 75 percent of patients reported suffering headaches afterward, the researchers said it was probably due to the surgical procedure rather than the stem cells themselves. Furthermore, there were no life-threatening effects linked to the procedure used to administer them.  Motor improvement was also independent of the severity of the stroke patients’ conditions— an important detail considering older adults tend to respond less to treatment, the researchers said.  In addition to setting the stage for an expanded trial of the procedure, the promising results also change “our notion of what happens after a stroke,” Steinberg explained. The findings suggest that stroke-damaged areas of the brain, once thought to be dead or irreversible, can actually be “resurrected.”  Source: Steinberg G, Kondziolka D, Wechsler L, et al.

By Andrew M. Seaman  Melanoma survivors may want to enlist partners to help search their bodies for suspicious looking moles, according to new research.  The researchers previously found that skin cancer survivors and their partners could be trained to spot potentially cancerous moles by doing skin exams. The new report shows that during the two years, those same people had increasing confidence in their skills, with no increase in embarrassment or discomfort.  “There was concern that they might be embarrassed by examining areas of the body that aren’t normally seen close up,” said lead author Dr. June Robinson, of Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago.  Melanoma survivors were previously told to use mirrors to check inaccessible areas of their bodies, she told Reuters Health.  “For example, men can’t see the top of their bald heads or the back of their necks or ears,” Robinson said.  The new study focused on 395 pairs of melanoma survivors who had received training in skin exams in the original study. The participants attended “booster” training sessions and completed surveys every four months for the next two years.  Overall, the trained group found 51 early melanomas during the study, compared to 18 melanomas found by a comparison group of patients and partners who didn’t receive training.  Among people who received the skin exam training, the researchers found a steep increase in their confidence at performing skin exams between the start of the study and four months later.  “Their confidence level goes up and plateaus at eight to 12 months, and it doesn’t go down,” said Robinson.  The exams didn’t become more embarrassing or less comfortable, either.  The new results show people can ask friends or relatives to help examine their bodies for suspicious moles, said Robinson.  “That’s a simple enough statement, and people are not put off by that,” she said.  Bringing this program into the mainstream presents some challenges, however. Each person in the study was trained on how to find melanoma and attended booster sessions every four months.  “We are now trying to see if people can learn, perform and have continuing confidence without the physician reinforcement,” said Robinson.  For now, she said people can go to the American Academy of Dermatology's website to learn the steps - known as the ABCDEs - of finding melanoma (bit.ly/2h9zl0Y).	0
"The ancient art of applying suction cups to the body has gotten a boost from several new studies that show it helps relieve a variety of painful conditions. But scientists say larger, more rigorous studies are needed.  In fire cupping, burning cotton is placed inside a glass cup, which creates a vacuum as it cools.  Cupping, as the practice is called, was performed traditionally in China and other countries, and is now available from acupuncturists, and some chiropractors and massage therapists in the U.S. In the traditional method, called fire cupping, a ball of burning cotton is briefly placed inside a glass cup to heat the air inside, which then creates a partial vacuum as it cools. Newer-style plastic or silicone cups have valves that attach to hand pumps used to create suction.  Until recently, there was scant published evidence in favor of cupping for pain relief. Over the past three years, a handful of new studies have shown it helps relieve back, neck, carpal tunnel and knee pain.  There are a number of theories on how cupping may work to relieve pain. A widely held one is that suction on the skin ""increases blood flow to the area and creates a mild immune response,"" says Kathleen Lumiere, an assistant professor of acupuncture and oriental medicine at Bastyr University in Kenmore, Wash. It also helps release fascia, connective tissue that can pull on muscles causing pain or limited motion, clinicians say.  Typically cups are on for up to 20 minutes and leave a temporary reddish mark that looks ""like rare roast beef,"" says Brian K. Nathanson, a Norwalk, Conn., chiropractor who has been doing cupping for about five years.  Some clinicians slide the cups on the body, using them as massage tools in a technique sometimes called running cupping. ""People who love deep-tissue massage love cupping,"" says Gabrielle Francis, a Manhattan chiropractor and acupuncturist who does both static cupping and running cupping. Both can cause mild discomfort in some patients, clinicians say.  Cupping is an ancient healing art that was traditionally practiced in China, the Middle East and other countries. Corbis  Gwyneth Paltrow caused a stir when she appeared with cupping marks on her back at a movie screening in New York in 2004. Associated Press  The intrepid can opt for ""wet cupping,"" in which the skin is punctured with a lancet before the cups are applied. The technique, which draws out a small quantity of blood, can have a powerful effect—particularly on areas where you can feel a hard lump of knotted muscles, says Kristine Tohtz, a Chicago chiropractor and acupuncturist who does wet and dry cupping.  Cost of cupping varies widely, from $40 to $100 or more for a half-hour session. It shouldn't be done on pregnant women, people with heart conditions or people with bleeding disorders, clinicians say. Caution should be used if a person has thin skin that might tear easily.  In a study of people with neck pain caused by computer use, ""cupping therapy was effective in reducing pain,"" says Tae-Hun Kim, a researcher at the Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine in Daejeon, South Korea. The 40-person study, published online in September in the Journal of Occupational Health, found that six cupping sessions over two weeks was more effective on average in relieving pain than a heating pad—and the benefit lasted a month after treatment ended.  But, says Romy Lauche, a scientist at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Essen, Germany, ""the studies are very preliminary. We cannot say it has proven its efficacy.""  Dr. Lauche co-authored a 50-person study published last year that found a single wet-cupping treatment on average significantly reduced chronic neck pain three days after the treatment, compared with a control group that had no treatment. Location of the cups varied with each patient but typically was on the trapezius muscle, which spans the neck, shoulders and upper back. In unpublished results, she adds, scientists found the pain relief lasted for months.  In a 40-person German study published in October, cupping therapy significantly relieved knee arthritis pain compared with patients who received no treatment. But the study's lack of a control group treated with a sham technique ""raises questions of whether it is cupping that is really working or if it has a placebo effect,"" says David Felson, who directs an arthritis research program at Boston University School of Medicine.  Dr. Lauche agrees that lack of a placebo control is a flaw in the studies. A new study, currently ongoing for fibromyalgia pain, is testing cupping against a sham cup that attaches with adhesive and provides minimal suction, she says.  —Email aches@wsj.com  Write to Laura Johannes at laura.johannes@wsj.com"	0
NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories Inc’s experimental Absorb heart stent, designed to dissolve and thereby restore the blood vessel’s natural flexibility, has proven safe and effective a year after being implanted in patients, researchers said.  The findings, which follow similarly promising 6-month and 9-month data on the plastic device, were described at the annual scientific sessions of the American College of Cardiology in New Orleans.  Abbott said 6.9 percent of patients suffered major cardiac events — including heart attacks — over a 12-month period, which the device maker described as a low rate. During the same period, no blood clots were reported among patients who were far enough along in testing to be evaluated in the 101-patient study.  Absorb, like traditional metal stents, is meant to prop open heart arteries that have been cleared of plaque. But unlike the millions of metal stents that are implanted in patients each year, it does not remain fixed in the arteries for life.  “The trial’s results would be equivalent to an excellent metallic stent - that type of performance,” said Dr. Patrick Serruys, a cardiologist from Erasmus University Hospital in Rotterdam, who led the study.  The stent was approved in Europe in January, but will not be widely available there until late next year. It was cleared by European regulators even though large so-called pivotal trials have not yet been conducted on the product.  Abbott plans to begin a 500-patient pivotal trial in Europe later this year and to conduct a 2,000-patient trial in the United States by the end of 2011. It hopes to seek U.S. approval for the product in 2015, several years before any competitor.  Serruys said current stents are essentially “cages” that hamper the flexibility of arteries and make them more prone to reclogging as they develop scar tissue and plaque builds up.  He said Absorb and stents like it will likely be the next generation of stents and ultimately improve outcomes for patients.  He said bioresorbable materials have great potential for other uses, particularly for stents to repair the pulmonary arteries and aortas of babies.  “The baby will grow and the biodegradable material will disappear,” he said. “That would be one compassionate use of it, a very serious application. Otherwise, you’d be forced to reopen the baby to remove metallic stents.”	1
"Marco della Cava  USA TODAY  SAN FRANCISCO — Tech company developer conferences always feature a wacky demo or three.  But at Build 2017 in Seattle Wednesday, Microsoft went for the waterworks at the conclusion of CEO Satya Nadella's keynote address: it showcased a prototype watch that temporarily eliminated the arm shaking that often plagues those suffering from the neurological disease Parkinson's.  After a speech that both heralded and warned about coming leaps in technological power, Nadella screened a video that told the story of two British Microsoft Research employees, Haiyan Zhang and Nicolas Villa, who developed the tremor-interrupting device for a BBC documentary, The Big Life Fix.  Working with graphic designer and Parkinson's sufferer Emma Lawton, 32, the researchers developed a watch — which they named Emma — that, according to Microsoft, ""vibrates in a distinctive pattern to disrupt the feedback loop between brain and hand.""  The video showed Lawton trying to draw a square with her shaky right hand, and then again, wearing Emma. Watson erupts in tears as she calls her mother to say this is the first time she's been able to write her name in ages.  When the lights went up, Nadella welcomed both Lawton and engineer Zhang on stage, thanking them for showing that thanks ""developers can have impact.""  Emma Watch remains a prototype, Microsoft says, but the developers are working with a neuroscience research team to undertake trials with a small group of Parkinson's sufferers.  The watch works through a combination of sensors and AI (artificial intelligence) techniques to potentially detect and monitor symptoms like tremors, stiffness and instability, among others, according to Microsoft. ""Once these symptoms can be identified and measured, it’s possible to develop technology and devices that help humans manage their symptoms. AI is used to classify the sensor information and elicit real-time responses on small devices like wearables.""  Microsoft stresses that Emma Watch is not a cure for the disease, which afflicts 10 million people. ""Rather, its technology has the potential to help Parkinson’s patients manage symptoms that impede regular functions. The goal of further research is to determine whether Emma Watch could help other people with similar Parkinson’s symptoms.""  Follow USA TODAY tech reporter Marco della Cava on Twitter."	1

The first new flu drug in 20 years won approval Wednesday from the Food and Drug Administration.  The new antiviral, generically known as baloxavir marboxil but sold under the brand name Xofluza, is a single dose treatment. It is for use only in those aged 12 or more, the F.D.A. said, and should be taken only in the first two days after symptoms like fever, aches and sniffles appear.  The pill will cost $150, according to a spokeswoman for Genentech, which will sell Xofluza in this country. Genentech will offer coupons that lower the price to $30 for patients with health insurance and to about $90 for the uninsured.  Flu season has already begun, and last year’s was one of the most lethal in decades; about 80,000 Americans died of flu or its consequences, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said earlier this month .  The new drug is no miracle cure and it is not approved for young children, who are one of the most vulnerable groups, so the C.D.C. still strongly recommends that every American over the age of six months get a flu shot as soon as possible.	0
The gene responsible for cystic fibrosis was discovered in 1989. Now, 22 years later, a drug that tries to compensate for the genetic defect might be nearing the market.  Vertex Pharmaceuticals announced Wednesday morning that the drug, VX-770, improved lung function in people with cystic fibrosis in a late-stage clinical trial. The drug also reduced the frequency of disease exacerbations that required treatment with antibiotics.  The caveat is that VX-770 is designed to counter one specific genetic mutation that accounts for about 4 percent of cases of cystic fibrosis. Vertex is working on another drug for the most common mutation, but that one is further behind in development.  Still, the news is expected to be greeted favorably by doctors and patients and by Wall Street.  “I’ve been doing clinical trials for 30 years in C.F. and these are amazing results,’’ Dr. Bonnie W. Ramsey, a lead investigator in the trial, said in an interview.  Dr. Ramsey, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Washington, was briefed on the results by Vertex.  The results were announced by a press release and have not been peer reviewed by experts.  About 30,000 Americans and 70,000 people worldwide have cystic fibrosis, a disease caused by defects in a gene responsible for the transport of chloride ions across cell membranes. People with the disease tend to have very thick mucus in their lungs, which leads to infections and lung damage. Many do not live past age 40.  Two inhaled antibiotics and one drug that loosens mucus are approved to treat cystic fibrosis, but nothing that directly improves chloride ion transport.    In the trial, those who received VX-770 gained 10.6 percentage points more on a lung function test after 24 weeks than those getting a placebo, a difference that statistically was highly significant. Patients continued to take either drug or placebo for another 24 weeks and the improvement was sustained. Lung function, the primary endpoint of the trial, was measured by how much a person could exhale in one second, a standard test.  Investors had been expecting around a 5 percentage point improvement. In a note to clients Tuesday evening, before the results were known, an analyst at ISI Group, Mark Schoenebaum, said that an improvement of 10 percent would be a “home run’’ that could lead to $600 million in annual sales for the drug.  Dr. Ramsey, who has received research grants from Vertex, said that some patients could perceive a 10 percentage point change in lung function. She said other results of the trial were encouraging.  These included fewer exacerbations of the disease in those who got the drug, fewer self-reported respiratory symptoms, and a gain in weight, which is good for people with cystic fibrosis, who often have digestive problems. The saltiness of their sweat — a measure used to diagnose the disease — was markedly reduced, suggesting that the drug was having an effect on chloride ion transport.  The trial involved 161 people age 12 and older, all with at least one copy of the particular mutation, known as G551D. The main side effects, Vertex said, were headache, upper respiratory tract infections, nasal congestion, rash and dizziness.  Vertex said it hoped to apply in the second half of the year for approval of VX-770 in the United States and Europe. The company is awaiting results of a second trial of the drug, this one in younger children.  Vertex has not said how much it will charge for VX-770. But since there are only about 1,200 Americans who are candidates for the drug, the price is likely to be tens of thousands of dollars a year.  Vertex, based in Cambridge, Mass., was founded in 1989, coincidentally the same year the cystic fibrosis gene was discovered. It has not yet had a big commercial success and had a $2.5 billion net loss in the last five years.  The company is hoping that by late May it will win approval to sell a new type of drug for hepatitis C, which analysts expect will be a blockbuster.  The long time needed to develop a drug for cystic fibrosis is a lesson for those expecting a quick payout from the sequencing of the human genome, which was completed a decade ago. It is not enough to know the gene behind a disease. It can take years of research to determine how a mutation actually causes a disease and then to design a drug that corrects the problem.  Vertex received $75 million in financial support from the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, one of the first nonprofit disease groups to give money to companies.  “These results are highly encouraging,’’ Robert J. Beall, president of the foundation, said in a statement Wednesday. “They provide scientific evidence that support our long-standing belief that targeting the underlying defect of C.F. may have a profound effect on the disease.’’	0
"En Español  SUNDAY, Jan. 17, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Giving a vaccine through a scratch on the skin (scarification) triggers a stronger immune response than injected vaccines, say U.S. researchers, who also found that scarification requires 100 times less vaccine to prompt an immune response.  Scarification was first used nearly two centuries ago to give the first smallpox vaccinations. Nearly all modern vaccines are given via injection, according to background information in a news release about the study, which is published in the Jan. 17 issue of Nature Medicine.  In a series of tests, the Brigham and Women's Hospital researchers also found that the memory of T-cells -- the cells that mount an immune response against invading viruses -- may be more important than the antibodies generated by injected vaccines. T-cells are located in lymph nodes and blood, as well as in peripheral tissues such as skin and lung.  ""This research illustrates the remarkable capacity of the most superficial layer of skin to generate powerful protective immune responses after vaccination,"" study senior researcher Dr. Thomas Kupper, chairman of the dermatology department at the hospital, said in a news release from the hospital.  ""The ability of vaccination through injured epidermis -- or scarification -- to generate such powerful tissue-resident protective T-cells is a completely novel observation that should make us reconsider the way we think about vaccine delivery for all infectious diseases, as well as cancer. After all, our immune system evolved over millions of years to respond to infections of injured skin, not vaccines delivered by hypodermic syringe into muscle,"" he noted.  In their experiments, Kupper and colleagues found that scarification with the vaccinia virus offered much greater protection against smallpox than injecting the vaccine. They also found that a melanoma vaccine delivered by scarification was much more effective than injected vaccines in protecting animals against melanoma tumor growth.  ""The lessons we are learning from these studies of vaccination by scarification could help us develop new and more powerful vaccines for influenza, HIV, malaria and other infectious diseases,"" Kupper explained. ""We should also continue to explore the implications for developing powerful cancer vaccines, like the one demonstrated by melanoma vaccine results in this study.""  More information  The U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases has more about vaccines."	1
"En Español  By Karen Pallarito  HealthDay Reporter  MONDAY, Oct. 9, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Drinking plenty of water each day may have an unexpected benefit -- staving off urinary tract infections, a new study reports.  Young women plagued by UTIs who drank an additional 6 cups of water each day were nearly half -- 48 percent -- as likely as a control group to have another infection, the study showed.  The water group also reduced their use of antibiotics by roughly half -- or 47 percent.  What's more, the amount of time that passed before a woman's next UTI and between recurrent infections was longer in the water group than in the control group.  Women are more prone to UTIs than men, partly due to their anatomy. A shorter urethra makes it easier for bacteria from rectum to enter the vagina and travel to the bladder.  Study author Dr. Thomas Hooton said it's thought that increasing fluid intake decreases UTI risk in two ways: by preventing bacteria from adhering to the bladder and by reducing the overall concentration of bacteria that could cause an infection.  ""Flushing bacteria out of the bladder, it's been known, at least it's been thought, that it is protective. This study suggests that it is,"" said Hooton, clinical director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Miami School of Medicine.  Dr. Hunter Wessells, who wasn't involved in the study, called the additional fluid intake ""substantial,"" leading to a corresponding increase in urine output.  ""It is the urine output which is of course the key factor leading to the effect seen in the study,"" said Wessells, chair of the department of urology at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.  Dr. Susan Bleasdale, medical director of infection control at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said the study ""may be a game changer"" for antibiotic ""stewardship"" programs aimed at reducing inappropriate antibiotic use.  She cited a 2010 review estimating that 11 million to 12 million women a year will suffer from a UTI, accounting for 1.6 billion antibiotic prescriptions a year.  ""We might not even need to use antibiotics,"" she said.  The study, conducted in Bulgaria, involved 140 healthy premenopausal women who had at least three UTIs in the past year. All reported low daily fluid intake. They drank roughly four cups of fluid per day, including just 2 cups of water a day.  Half of the women in the study were asked to consume 1.5 liters of water, or about 6 cups, each day in addition to their usual daily fluid intake. Specifically, they were asked to begin drinking a 1/2-liter water bottle at each meal and finish each bottle before the next meal.  The remaining women served as a control group. They continued their usual fluid intake.  The women were followed for a year, with clinic visits at the beginning of the study as well as 6 and 12 months later. Researchers measured their water and fluid intake; urine volume, frequency and concentration; and symptoms. They also called the women each month to assess compliance and counsel them to return to the clinic for evaluation and possible treatment if they were experiencing UTI symptoms.  Overall, the water group increased daily water intake by close to 5 cups a day. Their total daily fluid intake, including water and other beverages, averaged nearly 12 cups.  By contrast, the control group's total daily fluid intake was less than half of that.  Hooton noted that it's not clear exactly how much fluid intake must increase to deliver a benefit.  ""There's no magic in a liter-and-a-half,"" he said.  Likewise, he believes any increase in fluid -- not just water -- may be beneficial since fluids are mostly water. And while the study involved younger women, he said older women who experience recurrent UTIs may benefit from increasing their daily fluid intake as well.  Whether the advice would benefit women with normal urine output, however, is unclear, Wessells noted.  ""In addition, the bother associated with the higher urine output, and feasibility of implementing this water intake strategy across a range of occupations and ages, requires further study as well,"" he said.  Researchers presented the findings Saturday at IDWeek 2017, the annual meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, the HIV Medicine Association and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society.  Research presented at meetings is generally considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed publication.

"In a bid to increase treatments for the nation’s 79 million obese adults, the Food and Drug Administration has approved U.S. marketing of an implantable device that stimulates weight loss by manipulating key appetite signals passing between the brain and the gut.  The new device is the Maestro Rechargeable System, manufactured by EnteroMedics of St. Paul, Minn. While the FDA has approved four medications for weight loss in the past 2 1/2 years, the Maestro system is the first weight loss device to be approved since 2007.  Using electrical leads implanted just above the stomach and a regulator carried under the skin near the ribcage, the device suppresses signals carried by the vagus nerve.  The device adopts a variant of a “neuromodulation” technique long used in the treatment of epilepsy: by applying intermittent bursts of electrical current to the vagus nerve, it disrupts the signals that prompt the stomach to relax, expand and prepare for an influx of food.  Advertisement  “We think it will be a very important tool in the toolbag of surgeons and physicians treating obesity and its co-morbidities,” said Gregory S. Lea, senior vice president and chief financial officer of EnteroMedics. “When patients leave the diet, counseling and drug world and have nothing more, they turn to surgical procedures, and only 1% to 2% of patients who might be eligible for bariatric surgery are getting it.”  The FDA approved the use of the device in adult patients with a body mass index, or BMI, between 35 and 45, who have at least one other obesity-related condition, such as type 2 diabetes.  Delivered by the Maestro device, vagal blocking therapy, or VBLOC, offers obese patients a weight loss therapy that does not permanently alter the digestive system in the way that gastric bypass surgery does, and which may be less expensive, said Lea. He added it poses no risk of the “malabsorption” problems that often come with such surgery.  In a 12-month clinical trial considered by the FDA, 38.3% of subjects who received the active Maestro device lost at least a quarter of their excess weight, and 52.5% of subjects lost at least 20% of their excess weight. On average, weight loss in those subjects with an active device was about 8.5% greater than that seen in subjects who received a Maestro electrical pulse generator that was not activated.  Advertisement  The human body’s longest cranial nerve, the vagus--or “wandering""--nerve stretches from the lower abdomen up to the brain stem, passing through the heart, esophagus and lungs. A key node in the body’s involuntary nervous system, it carries signals between body and brain that control heart rate, digestive processes and respiration.  In a 60- to 90-minute laparoscopic procedure, physicians trained to implant the new device will attach its electrical leads to the anterior and posterior trunks of the vagus nerve, right at the gastric junction. During a patient’s waking hours, the device is designed to alternate between delivering five-minute bursts of high-frequency energy and five minutes of inactivity. During sleep, the device powers down.  By suppressing the exchange of messages that cue hunger and ready the stomach for food, the intermittent electrical currents make most feel less hungry, feel full sooner and to feel full for longer. Most eat less and lose weight.  Researchers testing the device also observed that, like bariatric surgery, it might have beneficial effects that go beyond weight loss. Suppressing signals between gut and brain on the vagus nerve appeared to improve the metabolic function of obese patients who got the device.  “You actually see the effect before patients actually have had that much weight loss,” said Dr. Ken Fujioka, a Scripps Institute endocrinologist and weight management expert who conducted some of the studies that led to the EnteroMedics device. That suggests that the device may be especially beneficial for those who have developed obesity-related type 2 diabetes, he said.  The on-again, off-again nature of the Maestro device’s stimulation serves another purpose: it prevents the vagus nerve’s gut signals from going silent--a communication loss that would likely prompt the central nervous system to find a compensatory workaround.  As a result, said Lea, the Maestro device appears to be safe and effective for long-term use, and unlike surgical alterations to the digestive system, reversible. Women who have had the device implanted and became pregnant were able to have it inactivated during their pregnancy, and then reactivated afterward, he said.  While the cost of the device has not yet been set, Lea said that getting the device implanted and activated will likely cost “somewhere between $20,000 and $30,000""--an amount that is more than gastric banding but less some of the most complex gastric bypass surgery.

Surgeons sometimes fly blind when operating on hard-to-reach anatomical parts or hard-to-see conditions. For visual references inside the brain or body, they often rely on images and scans taken before an operation.  A growing number of hospitals are equipping operating suites with magnetic resonance imaging, CT scanners and other technology that enables surgeons to scan a patient in real time, without having to move them from the operating table.  The resulting real-time 3D visuals—known as “intraoperative imaging”—help surgeons excise tumors and tissue with greater accuracy, reducing risks, such as nicked nerves from an errant knife, and the potential need for repeat surgery. The images also help surgeons spot bleeding, blood clots or other unexpected complications outside their field of vision.  Intraoperative imaging allows surgeons to perform “significantly better” than conventional surgery, says Sohail Mirza, medical director of the Center for Surgical Innovation and chairman of orthopedics at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock health system in Lebanon, N.H., affiliated with Dartmouth College’s medical school.  “We still need a surgeon’s training and judgment,” Dr. Mirza says, “but we can use three-dimensional deep imaging to get past the limitations of human error and hand-eye coordination.” Dartmouth-Hitchcock opened the $20 million center last year with financing from a National Institutes of Health grant and its own funds. MRI and CT scanners mounted on ceiling rails slide in and out of four sterile operating and procedure rooms.  The technology, first developed for use in complex brain surgeries, now is expanding for use in spinal cord surgery, biopsies and removal of tumors and lesions in the breast, lung, prostate, liver, pancreas and kidneys. Researchers are studying other ways the technology can help diagnose and treat cancer and other diseases.  Doctors used real-time MRI and CT scan images to remove a complicated tumor last year from the spine of Jack Deliso, 9, center. With him are his parents, Lisa and Michael, and sisters Chloe, left, and Rigney. Photo: Michael Deliso  The real-time scans can show surgeons whether tissue or organs have shifted during an operation, and where the border of a lesion ends and healthy tissue begins. In radiation treatment, doctors using the scans can see when a tumor shifts and pause to spare healthy tissue. The images can also provide better visualization of masses that are completely out of sight. Studies have found that in 40% of cases, brain surgeons will modify what they are doing based on an intraoperative MRI scan.  “This is precision medicine at its best, using an individual patient’s images to guide their procedure,” says Clare Tempany, co-director of the Advanced Multimodality Image-Guided Operating Suite program (known as Amigo) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. The program is part of the hospital’s federally-funded National Center for Image-Guided Therapy, which is researching the use of intraoperative imaging in a variety of procedures and treatments including its cost-effectiveness. Since Amigo opened in 2011, 700 patients have undergone surgery including lung biopsies and breast-conserving tumor removal.  The need for more accuracy is real. As many as 40% of women who have breast-conserving surgery known as lumpectomy followed by radiation need a second operation because positive cells remain. At Brigham and Women’s researchers are looking at how to improve surgeons’ ability to determine the exact margins of tumors using intraoperative MRI followed by chemical analysis to decrease the need for re-operations.  Dr. Mirza says in the past, during spine surgeries, if he became concerned about whether screws or implants were perfectly placed, he would close up an incision and wheel his patient two floors down for a scan. In some cases, he would bring the patient back to revise the surgery, or in other cases accept “slightly imperfect” results to avoid more cutting. Revisions, in addition to adding to the patient’s risks, use up costly operating room and staff time, he says.  Last fall, Jack Deliso, then 8, needed surgery to remove a painful mass wrapped around his lower spine that made it increasingly hard for him to walk. An initial biopsy to test for malignancy had been inconclusive. Dr. Mirza and a pediatric neurosurgeon, David Bauer, proposed cutting out the entire tumor in one procedure.  Jack’s parents, Michael and Lisa Deliso, were fearful that if nerves were damaged during surgery, his ability to walk as well as his bladder and bowel function could be impaired.  The technology was reassuring. “They explained to us that they were able to take the pictures with the MRI while they were operating to make sure they got everything, without having to damage nerves or disturb the tumor,” Mr. Deliso says.  Jack says he was calm going into surgery “because it just had to be done and there was no use being scared of it.” He was tired of lying awake at ni	1
Pregnancy experts, including those at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, recommend that most pregnant women get 30 minutes of exercise a day. If that feels a little onerous, consider new findings out of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston suggesting that love of physical activity may start in the womb.  So maybe women who won’t exercise for their own sake will do it for the baby.  The research in question involved mice, not women. A team led by Robert A. Waterland, an assistant professor of pediatrics, nutrition and molecular and human genetics, selected female mice that enjoyed running, according to a press release. (“Enjoyed”? Did they smile?) Half of them were put in cages with running wheels during pregnancy; the other half had no wheels.  The mice with running wheels voluntarily ran an average of more than six miles a night, decreasing to about two miles late in pregnancy. The offspring of those mothers turned out to be about 50 percent more physically active than those born to mothers that hadn’t had the exercise wheel option. And that difference persisted into mouse adulthood.  How does this relate to our own species?  Observational studies of active pregnant women and their babies have reported “results consistent with ours,” Waterland said. But in the human studies, it wasn’t always clear whether active mothers who have active children simply raised their kids to exercise a lot or whether there might have been a genetic predisposition to physical activity. The Baylor scientists were able to correct for those variables.  “Our study in a mouse model is important because we can take all those effects out of the equation,” Waterland said. “I think our results offer a very positive message. If expectant mothers know that exercise is not only good for them but also may offer lifelong benefits for their babies, I think they will be more motivated to get moving.”	1
Fred R. Conrad/The New York Times  A new study reports that beer is an excellent recovery beverage for marathon runners. But you may not want to start a raucous celebration just yet. The beer was effective only if it was nonalcoholic.  Running a marathon is, of course, punishing to the body, causing muscle soreness and inflammation. Grueling exercise can also weaken the immune system, making athletes susceptible to colds and other ills in the weeks after the event. Some athletes, particularly in Europe, long had downed nonalcoholic beer during hard training, claiming that it helped them to recover, but no science existed to support the practice.  To study the matter, researchers at the Technical University of Munich approached healthy male runners, most in their early 40s, who were training for the Munich Marathon, and asked if they would — in the name of science — be willing to drink a considerable amount of beer. Two hundred seventy-seven men agreed, even when told that the beverage would be nonalcoholic. Only half of the group received the alcohol-free beer, however; the other half got a similarly flavored placebo. No one knew who was drinking what.  All of the runners downed a liter to a liter and a half — about two to three pints — of their assigned beverage every day, beginning three weeks before the race and continuing for two weeks afterward. The scientists, meanwhile, collected blood samples from the men several weeks before the race, as well as immediately before to the start, at the finish line and on select days afterward. (These were an exceptionally obliging group of racers, it seems.) They monitored levels of various markers of inflammation in the men’s blood, to see whether beer helped to blunt some of the immediate damage from running.  For the next two weeks, the men continued to dutifully swallow their nonalcoholic beer or other brew. They also reported any symptoms of colds or other upper respiratory ailments that developed during that time.  The men drinking the nonalcoholic beer reported far fewer illnesses than the runners swallowing the placebo beverage. “Incidence of upper respiratory tract infections was 3.25-fold lower” in the nonalcoholic beer drinkers, the scientists reported, in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. They also showed significantly less evidence of inflammation, as measured by various markers in their blood, and lower counts of white blood cells than the placebo group, an indication of overall better immune system health.  These effects matter, said Dr. Johannes Scherr, lead author of the study, because if a marathon runner’s body is less sore and inflamed after a race, and he doesn’t develop the sniffles, he can recover and return to training more quickly than he otherwise might have been able to. “It can be speculated that the training frequency could be higher (with shorter breaks after vigorous training sessions)” in those drinking beer, he wrote in an e-mail response.  Just how nonalcoholic beer eases the ravages of strenuous marathon training and racing is still being investigated. But, said Dr. Scherr, it almost certainly involves the beverage’s rich bouquet of polyphenols, chemical substances found in many plants that, among other things, “suppress viral replication” and “influence the innate immune system positively,” all beneficial for fighting off a cold.  Alcoholic beer happens to be drenched in polyphenols, too — “even more than nonalcoholic beer,” Dr. Scherr said — but has the signal disadvantage of being alcoholic. “We do not know whether the side effects of alcoholic beer would cancel out the positive effects caused by the polyphenols,” he wrote. “Furthermore, it is not possible to drink one to one and a half liters of alcoholic beer per day, especially not during strenuous training.” We all knew that, right?  Of course, other substances containing polyphenols have shown early promise, and then underperformed in follow-up studies. Quercetin, for instance, a polyphenol derived principally from apple skins, was widely touted by endurance athletes several years ago after studies found that large doses allowed untrained lab mice to run for far longer than untreated animals. But the supplement has largely failed to show benefits in human athletes. An analysis of 10 human studies of the supplement presented at the American College of Sports Medicine annual meeting in June concluded that quercetin supplementation “is very unlikely to provide an endurance performance advantage.”  But the beer experiment did not begin by looking at mice. It began with human marathoners completing a punishing, unsimulated race, and showed demonstrable benefits, in terms of minimizing postrace damage.  All of which is good news as the fall marathon season approaches. Asked if he would recommend that serious marathon runners add nonalcoholic beer to their diets, Dr. Scherr said, “When I look at the results of our study, I would have to answer ‘Yes.’”  It’s poss	1
The researchers, including a team from the University of Pennsylvania, say the paper in the journal Science Translational Medicine is the first to show that a DNA vaccine alone produced a high level of immunity in people. At the same time, the researchers acknowledged that a working vaccine faces more trials and remains years away from an actual product.	0
"What Happens If You Try To Prevent Every Single Suicide?  Enlarge this image Maria Fabrizio for NPR Maria Fabrizio for NPR  Each year, nearly three times as many Americans die from suicide as from homicide. More Americans kill themselves than die from breast cancer.  As Dr.Thomas Insel, longtime head of the National Institute of Mental Health, prepared to step down from his job in October, he cited the lack of progress in reducing the number of suicides as his biggest disappointment. While the homicide rate in the U.S. has dropped 50 percent since the early 1990s, the suicide rate is higher than it was a decade ago.  ""That to me is unacceptable,"" Insel says.  It hasn't been for lack of trying. The U.S. has a national suicide hotline, and there are suicide prevention programs in every state. There's screening, educational programs, and midnight walks to raise awareness. Yet over the past decade or so, the national suicide rate has increased. In 2003, the suicide rate was 10.8 per 100,000 people. In 2013, it was 12.6.  An effort that began in Detroit in 2001 to treat the most common cause of suicide — depression — is offering hope. With a relentless focus on finding and treating people with depression, the Henry Ford Health System has cut the suicide rate among the people in its insurance plan dramatically. The story of the health system's success is a story of persistence, confidence, hope and a strict adherence to a very specific approach.  That approach saved the life of a woman who prefers to be known only by her first name, Lynn. She agreed to share her medical history on the condition that we not use her full name to protect her privacy.  Lynn, who's now in her mid-50s, has had bipolar disorder, also known as manic-depressive illness, for nearly 30 years. The depressive part of her illness ""is like the pain of having a cancer,"" she says. About 15 years ago, she started getting irresistible urges to take her own life and she started making serious attempts — at times almost monthly.  ""When I was in the depths of depression, I was being pulled and sucked into this black tunnel,"" she says. ""I was desperately trying to grab onto something to stop from being sucked in."" Sometimes she couldn't find anything to hang on to. ""Those are the times when I finally let go and attempted suicide,"" she says.  The program that saved Lynn almost didn't get off the ground.  Fifteen years ago, suicide prevention care at Henry Ford, like in many places, was mostly reactive. When patients came in talking about suicide, health providers took notice. But little was done to find people before they reached that point.  Some of the health providers in the psychiatric division decided they could do better. So they applied to a foundation for a grant to provide something they called ""perfect depression care"" for the 200,000 patients in the health system. The goal: zero suicides.  The mental health division failed to win the grant, but the health system went ahead with the proposed changes anyway.  The plan it developed is intensive and thorough, an almost cookbook approach. Primary care doctors screen every patient with two questions: How often have you felt down in the past two weeks? And how often have you felt little pleasure in doing things? A high score leads to more questions about sleep disturbances, changes in appetite, thoughts of hurting oneself. All patients are questioned on every visit.  If the health providers recognize a mental health problem, patients are assigned to appropriate care — cognitive behavioral therapy, drugs, group counseling, or hospitalization if necessary. On each patient's medical record, providers have to attest to having done the screening, and they record plans for any needed care.  Therapists involve patients' families, and ask them to remove guns or other means of suicide from their homes. Clerks are trained to make sure that patients who need followup care don't leave without an appointment. Patients themselves come up with ""safety plans.""  Lynn has two copies, one by her nightstand and one in her kitchen. Each lists things she can do when she feels depression coming on. She could sit on her balcony, or do some drawing or painting. The list includes her therapists' phone numbers. And there's a reminder that the feeling will pass — it has before.  Before the zero suicide plan went into effect, says psychiatrist Doree Ann Espiritu, acting head of the zero suicide program at Henry Ford, you might make a contract with a patient where the patient agrees not to commit suicide. Studies show it doesn't work very well, she says.  Today, providers are trained to be comfortable asking their patients about suicidal thoughts. ""There is a fear among clinicians that if you ask questions about suicide, you are giving the patient an idea that this could be an option,"" says Espiritu, ""and if you ask about guns or pills, that you are giving them some hints on how they can carry out a plan.""

Thomas E. Hughes, chief executive of Zafgen, said the Boston company will use the data to prepare a “risk-mitigation” plan to help persuade the Food and Drug Administration to lift its so-called clinical hold on the late-stage trial, allowing it to resume. But he conceded that Zafgen, which had once hoped to begin selling its drug candidate, Beloranib, as early as 2016, will have to conduct at least one additional study before it can apply for FDA approval.  Zafgen Inc. is set Wednesday to release findings of a clinical trial showing many patients taking its experimental obesity treatment lost weight and engaged in less binge-eating, pointing to a way forward for a drug program halted by regulators last year after the deaths of two patients.  Advertisement  “We’re delighted with the results,” Hughes said in an interview. “This is the first demonstration of a clinical benefit against two of the major issues that affect this patient population. Our intention is to provide a plan for moving forward with an emphasis on patient safety.”  The clinical results did not address a key issue for patients and regulators: whether Beloranib triggered the blood clotting that resulted in two patient deaths last year. Zafgen has lost more than 80 percent of its stock value since the week in October when the first death was made public.  Many patients suffering from Prader-Willi syndrome, the rare condition Beloranib treats, are prone to blood-clotting and other diseases. Hughes said Zafgen will continue to study the effect of the drug in its further trials and risk-mitigation plan, and address it in discussions with FDA officials.  “As of today, we have no evidence to suggest that Beloranib by itself can cause blood clots,” Hughes said. “This is a patient population that’s at risk for thrombotic [clotting] issues.”  Zafgen said its six-month study involving 107 patients suffering from Prader-Willi syndrome met its two primary goals, known as end points: showing significant weight loss by many patients and a decrease of hyperphagia-related behavior, meaning excessive eating.  Advertisement  While the FDA’s clinical hold prevented Zafgen from completing its trial, Dennis D. Kim, the company’s chief medical officer, said it was largely finished. Sixty-eight of the enrolled patients completed the study, Kim said, while 27 other patients completed 20 of the trial’s scheduled 26 weeks. A small number of other patients withdrew early.  Zafgen has not identified the patients who died or said at which of 14 US trial sites they were taking the drug. Some analysts have suggested the FDA might approve the drug, despite the adverse events, if Zafgen can prove its benefits outweigh its risks to some patients.  There are currently no treatments for Prader-Willi syndrome, the most common genetic cause of life-threatening obesity. Prader-Willi affects an estimated 6,000 to 8,000 Americans.  It can dominate the lives of patients and their families, leading to excessive overeating, choking, and stomach rupture, along with slowed metabolism and psychiatric disorders.  Average life expectancy of Prader-Willi syndrome patients is 32 years.  “The efficacy of Beloranib looks very promising,” said Dr. Merlin G. Butler, director of research and genetics at the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, Kan., and a principal investigator for the clinical trial there. “We’ve seen individuals who have lost significant amounts of weight in the six-month period. We think the drug must at least diminish the food-seeking drive, which correlates to an increased caloric intake in patients.”  Advertisement  Zafgen, founded in 2005, is backed by investors that include venture capital firms Atlas Venture of Cambridge and Third Rock Ventures of Boston. The company raised $96 million in an initial public offering in 2014, using the money to finance its clinical studies.  Shares of Zafgen, which traded as high as $55.36 on the Nasdaq stock exchange last year, closed Tuesday at $5.62, down nearly 3.3 percent for the day.

"Breast Removal Reduces Cancer Risk In Some Women  Enlarge this image toggle caption Damian Dovarganes/AP Damian Dovarganes/AP  A new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association shows the clearest evidence yet that women carrying the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes should consider preventive surgery because they are at a very high risk for breast and ovarian cancers.  It confirms what smaller studies have suggested in the past: Women who have a family history of breast cancer can greatly reduce their chances of getting the disease by having a double mastectomy.  And, if they also have their ovaries removed, they can further reduce the risk of breast cancer and minimize their chances of getting ovarian cancer.  Researchers from around the country tracked nearly 2,500 women with the BRCA mutations who had surgery to try to prevent breast and ovarian cancer.  ""We found mastectomy provided huge risk reduction of subsequent breast cancer diagnosis and death. Risk reduction [was] probably in the range of 80 to 95 percent,"" said researcher Timothy Rebbeck, an epidemiologist at the University of Pennsylvania.  And women who had ovaries removed reduced their risk of ovarian cancer by as much as 80 percent.  The study findings are extremely reassuring to Rebbeck -- no breast cancer diagnoses among women who had double mastectomies after three years of follow-up. Among the women who did not have the surgery, 7 percent were later diagnosed with breast cancer.  Rebbeck says these decreases are big but are cautions that cancer risk will never be brought down to zero. That's because all the tissue is never completely taken out.  ""Breast tissue is found throughout the torso and can't be completely removed through surgical means. And, with ovarian cancer, the ovary leaves behind cells that could go on to become cancerous. So, it's just not possible to remove all the tissue that might be at risk,"" he says.  Toby's Story  One of the women who decided to take that chance is 61-year-old Toby of New Jersey. (Because she's worried about her health coverage, she doesn't want her last name used.)  Toby's mother died of ovarian cancer when Toby was in her 20s. Researchers now know that disease is linked, along with breast cancer, to genetic mutations.  Toby had first her ovaries and then both breasts removed after she tested positive for the BRCA genes about five years ago.  But at first, she had hoped to avoid the surgery.  ""After my genetic testing, they would alternate mammogram with MRI every six months. I thought I was getting very, very good surveillance, and I thought that would probably be enough and they would be able to diagnose something very, very early and be able to cure me if I were to get breast cancer,"" she says.  But her doctors thought otherwise. Breast cancer caused by BRCA mutations is particularly aggressive. And they told Toby her lifetime risk of that type of cancer was as high as 90 percent.  Toby was one of the women researchers from around the country tracked in the study to see how they fared after having this surgery.  Women like Toby who chose both ovary and breast removal had dramatically lower risks of getting both cancers after the surgery. Only 3 percent of those who had surgery died, compared with 10 percent of those who did not, during the follow-up period.  Role Of Genetic Testing  In an editorial accompanying the study, Virginia Kaklamani, an oncologist at Northwestern University, says lives can be saved if women have genetic testing.  ""A lot of times I see these women having had a very preventable type of breast cancer. Preventable because I can identify the fact that they had a higher risk of getting breast cancer,"" she says.  ""Had they been genetically tested a few years prior to my seeing them, they would have had the option of having bilateral mastectomy. So, we could have prevented these breast cancers and we didn't,"" says Kaklamani.  For Toby, it's been about a year since her double mastectomy. She's had reconstruction. And, today, she says she feels physically strong again. But she now feels an emotional empowerment, and that comforts her.  ""My mother left me when I was 26, and it was extremely painful and traumatic for my entire life,"" she says. ""I just didn't want to do that for my children. I had a chance to control that and to fight what my mother never had a chance for.""  Oncologist Kaklamani says women with the BRCA mutation should be counseled about genetic testing, and strongly consider it.  While surgical decisions are up to patients, the findings of this study should help them decide what to do, she says.  Toby has a daughter who decided to take the test, based on her mother's experience. She tested negative, Toby says."	1
"Whether you've been relatively inactive or fairly athletic, age is the enemy of one of the most important sets of muscles in the body: the group of four known as the rotator cuff that surround the ball of the shoulder joint.  About 54% of adults older than 60 have a completely or partially torn rotator cuff, compared with just 4% of those between 40 and 60. But tears are most frequently caused by degeneration of the tendon due to age, rather than injury from sports or trauma. Studies show that tears can be managed without surgery in half of patients, mainly through physical therapy, pain medications, and avoiding activities that cause pain.  But one's strength tends not to improve without surgery to reattach tendons to the ball of the shoulder joint. So, the question for many patients who want to have full use of their shoulder is less whether to have surgery than when and how. In a recent review in the Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers noted that patients and doctors struggle with when to stop nonoperative treatment in favor of surgery, but that repairing a tear earlier rather than later may result in better patient outcomes, earlier return to work and lower costs.  The Price of Delay  ""Many patients who have a tear figure they can take six months and live with it, but left alone the tear will progress and you can get to the point where it is irreparable,"" says David Altchek, a surgeon at New York's Hospital for Special Surgery. Dr. Altchek says repairing torn rotator cuffs earlier with a new technique that uses a double row of sutures to fix tendons to bone, rather than a single row, is improving healing rates in his studies.  While some tears may never worsen or need surgery, says Ken Yamaguchi, an orthopedic surgeon at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, ""the older somebody is when they get a repair, the less likely it is for the repair to heal.""  The good news is that surgery results in reduced pain and improved function in 80% to 95% of patients. And open surgery with big incisions is being replaced by new, less-invasive techniques known as mini-open and arthroscopic repair, which involve less pain and blood loss, shorter hospital stays and a generally easier rehabilitation period, according to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons.  Ask Your Doctor  The academy, which recently updated its guidelines for rotator-cuff repair, doesn't recommend for or against a specific technique for surgery. Dr. Yamaguchi, vice chairman of a working group that developed the guidelines, says there isn't enough high-quality evidence to recommend any specific technique, a conclusion also reached by the Annals of Internal Medicine researchers. He advises that patients confer with surgeons about their options.  The most common procedure is mini-open repair, which uses a smaller incision than traditional open repair. To remove any bone spurs, a surgeon uses arthroscopic, pencil-size instruments to magnify and illuminate the structures inside the joint. Once that is completed, the surgeon repairs the rotator cuff through the small incision. But some surgeons are now performing the entire operation using the small camera-guided instruments, in what's known as an all-arthroscopic procedure.  There are possible complications with all surgical procedures, of course. An Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons review of about 40 published studies showed that as many as 2% of patients have nerve injuries, while 1% may get an infection at the surgical site. About 6% may have a tendon re-tear, though that doesn't mean a repeat surgery will be needed or that pain and poor function will result.  Lengthy Recovery  And as with any surgery, postoperative recovery depends largely on how well patients adhere to their physical-therapy regimens. Initially, that means being extra careful: A repair needs to be protected until the tendon heals strongly to the bone. Patients may be advised to use a sling for the first four to six weeks after surgery and to limit active use of the arm. Therapy usually starts with passive-motion exercises, then range-of-motion exercises continue during the next six to 12 weeks. It can take as long as six months after surgery to return to a functional range of motion and adequate strength.  Eric Taylor, a 62-year-old documentary filmmaker who plays sports like tennis with his right arm, says he was surprised when he began developing pain in his left shoulder. He tried to ease it by doing yoga, but after six months with no relief, he scheduled an MRI. It confirmed that a bone spur digging into a tendon had caused a tear in the left rotator cuff.  He scheduled surgery with Dr. Altchek at the Hospital for Special Surgery last June, but wishes he had acted sooner. Because he waited so long, he says, his surgery required three incisions instead of one. He was surprised at how much work was involved in rehabilitation but has been diligent about his recovery and physical therapy.  Back to playing "	0
"By Trisha Henry  CNN Medical Producer  Drinking more than four cups of coffee may lower the risk of some head and neck cancers, according to a new study.  Researchers found that regular coffee drinkers – those who drank more than four cups of coffee a day – had a 39 percent decreased risk of two types of head and neck cancer: oral cavity and pharynx cancers. Coffee did not decrease the risk of a third type of oral cancer – laryngeal cancer. They looked at nine existing studies and analyzed how much coffee was consumed by more than 5,000 cancer patients and about 9,000 healthy people.  While these results are encouraging, it doesn't mean we should just go out and start drinking lots of coffee, says Mia Hashibe, lead researcher and an assistant professor in the department of family and preventive medicine at the University of Utah.  Hashibe points out that the main risk factors for oral cancers are smoking and drinking alcohol. She says the best way to prevent getting these cancers is to not smoke or drink alcohol, rather than drinking lots of coffee. ""We wouldn't want to be encouraging people to drink that much [coffee], without people considering the other risks factors,"" Hashibe says. ""Each person needs to think about how they metabolize caffeine or coffee.""  In the past, there’s been a perception that coffee may be bad for you, according to Dr. Donald Hensrud, chair of preventive medicine at the Mayo Clinic. But he says that newer studies suggest that drinking coffee may actually be good for you. ""Like many things, the evidence changes over time,"" says Hensrud. He adds that when it comes to the link between coffee and head and neck cancer, ""the benefits outweigh the risks and this is just one more piece of that puzzle that supports that.""  It’s not exactly known why coffee may help prevent these cancers. But coffee contains over 1,000 different chemical compounds, including cancer-fighting antioxidants, and it’s those antioxidants that may provide a “plausible explanation” for reducing the cancer risk, says Hensrud.  Other recent studies suggest coffee may have beneficial effects in other diseases like dementia, diabetes, liver and Parkinson's disease. However, coffee alone may not be the answer according to some experts. Dr. Dong Shin, a head and neck specialist at Emory Winship Cancer Institute says this new study suggests “there is a hint of beneficial outcomes"" with coffee and oral cancer. But he is concerned that the side effects of coffee are not addressed in this study. Shin says when it comes to preventing cancer, the combination approach is best. He suggests “consuming coffee, tea, veggies, and fruits rather than doing just one thing.""  Hensrud adds that there are some drawbacks to drinking too much coffee, including liver damage or increased blood pressure. Other possible side effects from drinking a lot of coffee include insomnia, reflux, heartburn, palpitations, urinary systems and increased fluid intake, says Hensrud. He says coffee can also be addictive and some people may suffer from withdrawal headaches. Too much coffee may make it harder to conceive and can increase the risk of miscarriage.  The study is published in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention.  Editor's Note: Medical news is a popular but sensitive subject rooted in science.

"Jack Crowley was 15 when a baseball hit him in the chest and stopped his heart. The Long Island teen survived, thanks to a police officer who grabbed a defibrillator and shocked his heart back into rhythm.  A blow to the chest — one that hits at just the wrong spot, at just the wrong time — can trigger deadly cardiac arrest. Fortunately it's rare. But most victims are otherwise healthy kid athletes. And survival hinges on fast use of those heart-zapping defibrillators that not every athletic league or school keeps near the playing fields.  There soon may be another attempt at protection: A U.S. organization that oversees athletic equipment has proposed the first performance standard for chest protectors to reduce the risk from those blows, a step that could lead to updated gear.  Nancy Crowley finds it hard to watch her three sports-loving sons' games since Jack's scary near-miss in a batting cage a year ago. She calls the latest move by the athletic industry overdue.  ""You cannot live in a bubble,"" acknowledged Crowley, who helped lobby local athletic officials to improve access to defibrillators but wants more protection. ""If a standard has come along that they feel is going to protect them in some way, I'm thrilled.""  Cardiac arrest, when the heart abruptly stops beating, is uncommon in young people, especially athletes who presumably are in their prime. There are no good counts in kids' athletics. Whatever the number — or whatever the cause — cardiac arrest is getting more attention from parents, coaches and heart specialists who say deaths should be preventable.  Indeed, NCAA guidelines recently reported in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology say defibrillators should be kept in the immediate vicinity of ""high risk locations"" such as weight rooms, basketball courts and ball fields.  For younger students, many states have laws encouraging or requiring defibrillators in schools but few specify athletic facilities, according to the advocacy group Parent Heart Watch.  The most frequent cause of cardiac arrest in a young athlete is an underlying structural problem of the heart, such as a thickened heart muscle, the problem often behind headline-making collapses of basketball players.  The chest protector standards take aim at a different problem: Every year, an estimated 10 to 20 people suffer what's called commotio cordis — cardiac arrest caused by a blow to the chest. A voluntary registry that has collected information on more than 250 cases over two decades does show survival increasing in recent years thanks to more defibrillator access.  The highest risk is to boys under 15, when the chest wall is still flexible, not as sturdy as it will become by their 20s when such deaths hardly ever are reported.  About a third of the time, victims were wearing some form of chest protector when they collapsed, showing at least some of today's equipment isn't enough, said Dr. Mark Link, a heart specialist at Tufts University Medical Center who spent more than a decade unraveling just how commotio cordis occurs.  Link's tests, using young pigs as a model, revealed that killer hits are those landing directly over the heart, at about 40 miles an hour — and in the milliseconds between heartbeats.  Armed with that science, the National Operating Committee on Standards for Athletic Equipment, or NOCSAE, funded creation of a sort of crash-test dummy to prove what gear really reduces the risk, and proposed the first standard for chest protectors used in baseball and lacrosse that aim to do so.  The idea: find materials that disperse the heart-damaging force of a blow without impeding players' movements — whether they're catchers or youngsters playing other positions who may wear shirt-like chest coverings under their uniforms. Guarding against commotio cordis may require a different design than standard foam that blocks a broken rib. Among the questions is how to integrate protection against both.  The standard is expected to be completed in January; only then could manufacturers label gear certified as meeting it. NOCSAE's recommendations often are adopted by sports governing bodies. It's not clear what such gear would cost.  Already, one company that uses military-grade materials in sports equipment has developed some lightweight protection it expects to fit the bill. In March, Link's team published lab tests in the Journal of Clinical Sports Medicine suggesting a combination of foams and polymers used by Pennsylvania-based Unequal Technologies is likely to be effective. The company, which funded the research, is producing chest protectors and heart-covering shirts that it plans to test against the final NOCSAE standard.  ""If we can stop a bullet, we can stop a ball,"" said Unequal chief executive Rob Vito.  Other manufacturers are traveling to NOCSAE's lab to learn to test products. Stan Jurga Jr. of All-Star Sporting Goods, a Massachusetts-based manufacturer, wonders if he'll need to alter equipment aimed at"	0
"Heterosexuals who are HIV negative can significantly reduce their risk of infection by taking a daily dose of an antiviral drug, according to a new study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  The study, called TDF2, followed 1,200 uninfected heterosexual men and women between the ages of 18 and 39 years in Botswana, Africa.  Study participants took a tablet containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emitricitabine (TDF/FTC), whose brand name is Truvada, or a placebo. On average, patients were followed for a year although some were followed for about three and a half years. The risk of infection was reduced 63% overall, but for participants who actually got the drugs, that risk decreased by 78%.  Giving daily antiretroviral drugs to uninfected individuals to prevent the disease is called pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP. Previous studies have shown PrEP to be effective in reducing infection rates among the uninfected.  Dr. Kevin Fenton, director of the CDC's national Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, called the news a milestone. ""It is clear we are not going to find one magic pill to solve the issue of HIV but by combining this approach with others we are beginning to get a better handle on combination packages. There is reason to be excited.""  The news comes at the same time a second study looking at PrEP in heterosexual couples in Kenya and Uganda also found significant reductions in infection rates. The Partners PrEP study participants took either TDF/FTC, the drug tenofovir–brand name Viread, or a placebo. Preliminary results showed both treatments significantly reduced transmission in couples where one partner was already infected with the virus. Patients who took tenofovir had 62% fewer infections while those taking the combination drug had 73% fewer infections than those who got the placebo.  ""Just a few years ago the tool kit for HIV prevention was not very large,"" says Dr. Jared Baeten, the principal investigator of the Partners PrEP study at the University of Washington. ""Now we have a nice collection of really powerful strategies that work for the population at greatest risk in the world. This is really a game changer.""  ""We now have findings from two studies showing that PrEP can work for heterosexuals, the population hardest hit by HIV worldwide,"" Fenton said. ""Taken together, these studies provide strong evidence the power of this prevention strategy.""  In fact, an interim review of the Partners data on effectiveness was so compelling that the trial was stopped early and the placebo arm was discontinued. Clear evidence Baeten said, that PrEP substantially reduces infection risk. At the same time he says, there was no evidence of safety concerns. Patients taking the placebo will be put on one of the drugs.  In the TDF2 study those taking the drug reported nausea, vomiting and dizziness.  An earlier PrEP trial, the iPrEx study, looked at treatment in men who have sex with men. Infection rates dropped by 90% in patients who consistently used PrEP.  “We are in a critical moment in HIV prevention research,” said Robert Grant, M.D., M.P.H, of the Gladstone Institutes and the University of California at San Francisco. He is the iPrEx protocol chair. “iPrEx provided the first proof of an important new method of HIV prevention that can help slow the global toll of 2.6 million new HIV infections each year. Partners PrEP and the TDF2 study have now expanded that finding by demonstrating the effectiveness of PrEP in heterosexual women and men.  ""Developing and deploying proven HIV prevention methods – including PrEP, microbicides, vaginal gels, clean needles, medical male circumcision, early treatment, counseling, testing, condoms and suppressive therapy for pregnant women will all be key to slowing the global epidemic,"" he said.  The CDC says the next step is to fully review all the data and begin to develop guidelines for the use of these drugs in heterosexual men and women here in the U.S."	0
"Now a large new analysis involving 250,000 patients shows that these medications may be as effective and safe as their older cousins, the angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE inhibitors.  Sripal Bangalore, an associate professor of cardiology at NYU Langone Medical Center who is lead author of the new study, said in an interview that the previous studies comparing the two may have been misinterpreted due to what he called a ""generation gap"" in participants and changes in their health care and lifestyle choices.  AD  AD  The idea that ACE inhibitors are more effective than ARBs was based on comparing studies on ACE inhibitors going as far back as the 1980s and into the 1990s with newer studies on ARBs in the 2000s.  These studies appeared to show a larger difference between ACE inhibitors and placebos versus ARBs and placebos. Most significantly, research showed a significant effect in reducing the risk of death with ACE inhibitors but not with ARBS. That led many doctors and standards groups to conclude that ACE inhibitors were more effective than ARBs.  But some doctors and researchers were puzzled by the fact that in head-to-head comparisons between the two classes of drugs they appeared to equally safe and effective. If there really was such a big difference between the medications, why didn't it show up in these types of studies?  AD  AD  That inconsistency created a confusing split in the medical community. Most guidelines set forth by the major medical groups suggest starting a patient with an ACE inhibitor first, but the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC) considers ACE inhibitors and ARBs to be equal.  Bangalore noticed that one assumption made in comparing the placebo trials -- that the patients in the group were about the same -- was incorrect. During that time period there was a remarkable shift in cardiovascular health care in America -- with a greater emphasis on not smoking, more statin use for cholesterol, better management of diabetes, lower targets for blood pressure.  ""The patients in the '80s and '90s were a higher-risk group than those in the 2000s,"" Bangalore explained. ""If your risk is higher it's easier to show a benefit. If your risk is lower it's harder to show a benefit.""  AD  AD  The new analysis, published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings on Monday, involves a second look at 106 randomized trials with 254,301 patients that took place after 2000 and shows that during this time period patient outcomes on the two medications were remarkably similar. The one difference they found was that ARBs tend to be better tolerated by patients, meaning that they have fewer side effects or result in fewer adverse events. ACE inhibitors are poorly tolerated by many patients because they can produce a bothersome dry cough, and some end up stopping medication as a result.  Bangalore said this is critically important because ""compliance is big issue with our patients.""  ""With hypertension they are on these medications for decades, and it's important to choose one that will be the most tolerable,"" he said.  AD  AD  The other piece of good news regarding the medications is that ACE inhibitors, as well as many ARBs, are now generic -- meaning that the cost difference is minimal.  The study was limited to patients who did not have heart failure, and because it involved a retrospective analysis of trials it was unable to control for differences in the design or data gathering of the previous work.

latimes.com/health/boostershots/la-heb-otitis-media-01122011,0,7521785.story  By Thomas H. Maugh II  3:15 PM PST, January 12, 2011  Advertisement  The decision on whether to give young children antibiotics to treat ear infections has been swinging from one extreme to the other as conflicting clinical trials have pushed pediatricians first toward widespread use of antibiotics, then toward a “watch and wait” approach in which most infections seem to clear up on their own.    Two new trials reported Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine are nudging the pendulum back toward treatment of the infections, known formally as acute otitis media, especially for the youngest children. They show that the use of antibiotics in infants under age 2 is only modestly effective and reduces the duration of symptoms by only a small amount, but it prevents relapses and progression of the disease.    The trials “are indicative of a benefit to treatment of acute otitis media in children, specifically when the diagnosis is certain,” said Dr. Wilbert Mason, an infectious diseases specialist at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles who was not involved in the study. The reduction of symptoms was marginal, he said, “but they were less likely to have a relapse or to have persistent signs of infection at the end of therapy.”    The findings “confirms the current guidelines” for treating children under age 2, said Dr. Al Lieberthal of USC’s Keck School of Medicine, who is in charge of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee that prepared the guidelines. The guidelines will be revised in light of the new studies, however, to tighten the definition of acute otitis media, he added.    There have been at least a dozen previous clinical trials studying the use of antibiotics in ear infections, known formally as acute otitis media. These have given mixed results, according to Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, because of poor study design and especially because of poor diagnosis of the subjects’ conditions.    “In many cases, [the children] had something that looked like otitis media but really wasn’t,” he said. The new studies “had really precise criteria to be eligible for enrollment,” which makes them “substantial studies.”    In one of the studies, Dr. Alejandro Hoberman of the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine and his colleagues studied 291 children age 6 months to 23 months with stringently defined acute otitis media. Half were given the antibiotic amoxicillin-clavulanate for 10 days and half a placebo.    In the second study, Dr. Paula A. Tahtinen of Turku University Hospital in Finland and her colleagues studied 319 children age 6 months to 35 months, half of whom were given the antibiotic and half a placebo for seven days.    In the Pittsburgh study, 80% of the children receiving an antibiotic had a resolution of symptoms by day seven, compared with 74% of those receiving a placebo. But 67% of those receiving an antibiotic had a sustained resolution of symptoms, compared with 53% of those who got the placebo.    The Finnish study looked for continuing symptoms, which is known as treatment failure. It found that, at the end of seven days, treatment failure occurred in 18.6% of those who received antibiotic, compared with 44.9% of those who received a placebo.    That sounds like a big improvement, said Dr. Richard Rosenfeld, chair of otolaryngology at SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, who also helped prepare the AAP’s guidelines, “but all it means is that if the eardrum looked nasty, the treatment failed. Eardrums sometimes take weeks to months to recover. That finding, to me, is a bit of a dubious way to say that everybody needs treatment.”    Experts noted, however, that certain children should receive immediate antibiotic treatment regardless of age. That includes those who are under 6 months of age; those who have a draining ear caused by a ruptured eardrum; those with severe symptoms early on; and those with infections in both ears.    But physicians are reluctant to give antibiotics indiscriminately because of the side effects, which include diarrhea, yeast infections, oral thrush, allergic reactions and resistant bacteria. “You pay a price for a little bit of improvement,” Rosenfeld said.	0
"En Español  MONDAY, Sept. 11, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- New research suggests that Opdivo -- a drug that works with the immune system to fight melanoma -- is more effective than the current standard of care for patients who've had surgery to remove advanced tumors.  The international study was funded by Opdivo's maker, Bristol-Myers Squibb, and included more than 900 patients with stage III and stage IV melanoma.  Patients were treated at 130 medical centers across 25 countries. All underwent surgery for their cancer before they began treatment with either Opdivo (nivolumab) or Yervoy (ipilimumab), the drug that's the current standard of care.  Both drugs are ""immunotherapies,"" which work by boosting the immune system's ability to spot and destroy tumor cells.  After a year of treatment, 71 percent of patients in the Opdivo group were alive without any recurrence of the disease, compared with 61 percent of those treated with Yervoy. And at 18 months, the rate was 66 percent for Opdivo and 53 percent for Yervoy, the findings showed.  According to the Skin Cancer Foundation, metastatic melanoma accounts for only about 1 percent of skin cancer cases but causes the majority of skin cancer deaths.  ""Our results demonstrate that [Opdivo] is more effective in treating patients with stage III and IV melanoma, cutting the risk of relapse by a third,"" lead researcher Dr. Jeffrey Weber, professor of medicine at NYU School of Medicine, said in a university news release.  ""Results like this will change how we practice medicine. Hopefully, physicians will embrace the use of [Opdivo] in these high-risk patients as adjuvant therapy,"" added Weber, who also helps direct NYU's Perlmutter Cancer Center in New York City.  One cancer surgeon who reviewed the findings was impressed.  ""Based on this study, it appears that patients with advanced melanoma who have their disease completely removed by surgery should go on to receive additional therapy with Opdivo,"" said Dr. Gary Deutsch. He is a surgical oncologist at Northwell Health's Imbert Cancer Center in Bay Shore, N.Y.  ""Not only did these patients have a better survival outcome at one year, but they had only one-third the side effects compared to Yervoy,"" Deutsch said.  The study found that patients taking Opdivo had fewer severe side effects than those taking Yervoy, at 14 percent versus 45 percent. Five percent of patients on Opdivo had to stop treatment due to side effects, compared with 31 percent of those on Yervoy. The most common side effects for both drugs were fatigue and diarrhea.  Weber added that ""the safety of [Opdivo] is very promising.""  The study is scheduled for presentation Monday in Madrid, Spain, at the annual meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology. It was also published online Sept. 10 in the New England Journal of Medicine.  Both Opdivo and Yervoy are already approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to treat advanced (metastatic) melanoma. In some patients, the drugs are used in combination.  Dr. Michele Green is a dermatologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. She said any advance in the care of aggressive melanomas is welcome news for patients.  ""It is amazing that there is now an alternative that is superior to conventional chemotherapy for advanced metastatic disease,"" Green said after reviewing the new study findings. ""With these advanced melanomas -- that have high risks of recurrences and have poor outcomes -- it is vital to look at alternative treatments. The future in cancer treatments lies in immunotherapy and other targeted options.""  More information  The U.S. National Cancer Institute has more on melanoma."	0
"Watch Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta's CNN Special Report ""Weed 4: Pot vs. Pills"" on Sunday, April 29, at 8 p.m. ET.  (CNN) Experts have proposed using medical marijuana to help Americans struggling with opioid addiction. Now, two studies suggest that there is merit to that strategy.  The studies, published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine , compared opioid prescription patterns in states that have enacted medical cannabis laws with those that have not. One of the studies looked at opioid prescriptions covered by Medicare Part D between 2010 and 2015, while the other looked at opioid prescriptions covered by Medicaid between 2011 and 2016.  The researchers found that states that allow the use of cannabis for medical purposes had 2.21 million fewer daily doses of opioids prescribed per year under Medicare Part D, compared with those states without medical cannabis laws. Opioid prescriptions under Medicaid also dropped by 5.88% in states with medical cannabis laws compared with states without such laws, according to the studies.  ""This study adds one more brick in the wall in the argument that cannabis clearly has medical applications,"" said David Bradford , professor of public administration and policy at the University of Georgia and a lead author of the Medicare study.  ""And for pain patients in particular, our work adds to the argument that cannabis can be effective.""  Medicare Part D, the optional prescription drug benefit plan for those enrolled in Medicare, covers more than 42 million Americans, including those 65 or older. Medicaid provides health coverage to more than 73 million low-income individuals in the US, according to the program's website  ""Medicare and Medicaid publishes this data, and we're free to use it, and anyone who's interested can download the data,"" Bradford said. ""But that means that we don't know what's going on with the privately insured and the uninsured population, and for that, I'm afraid the data sets are proprietary and expensive.""  'This crisis is very real'  The new research comes as the United States remains entangled in the worst opioid epidemic the world has ever seen. Opioid overdose has risen dramatically over the past 15 years and has been implicated in over 500,000 deaths since 2000 -- more than the number of Americans killed in World War II  ""As somebody who treats patients with opioid use disorders, this crisis is very real. These patients die every day, and it's quite shocking in many ways,"" said Dr. Kevin Hill , an addiction psychiatrist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the new studies.  ""We have had overuse of certain prescription opioids over the years, and it's certainly contributed to the opioid crisis that we're feeling,"" he added. ""I don't think that's the only reason, but certainly, it was too easy at many points to get prescriptions for opioids.""  Like opioids, marijuana has been shown to be effective in treating chronic pain as well as other conditions such as seizures, multiple sclerosis and certain mental disorders, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse . Research suggests that the cannabinoid and opioid receptor systems rely on common signaling pathways in the brain, including the dopamine reward system that is central to drug tolerance, dependence and addiction.  ""All drugs of abuse operate using some shared pathways. For example, cannabinoid receptors and opioid receptors coincidentally happen to be located very close by in many places in the brain,"" Hill said. ""So it stands to reason that a medication that affects one system might affect the other.""  But unlike opioids, marijuana has little addiction potential, and virtually no deaths from marijuana overdose have been reported in the United States, according to Bradford.  ""No one has ever died of cannabis, so it has many safety advantages over opiates,"" Bradford said. ""And to the extent that we're trying to manage the opiate crisis, cannabis is a potential tool.""  Comparing states with and without medical marijuana laws  In order to evaluate whether medical marijuana could function as an effective and safe alternative to opioids, the two teams of researchers looked at whether opioid prescriptions were lower in states that had active medical cannabis laws and whether those states that enacted these laws during the study period saw reductions in opioid prescriptions.  Both teams, in fact, did find that opioid prescriptions were significantly lower in states that had enacted medical cannabis laws. The team that looked at Medicaid patients also found that the four states that switched from medical use only to recreational use -- Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington -- saw further reductions in opioid prescriptions, according to Hefei Wen , assistant professor of health management and policy at the University of Kentucky and a lead author on the Medicaid study.

"Amid a dry spell for breakthrough cancer drugs, recent U.S. approval of Eisai Co.'s Halaven represents some vindication for a small group of researchers who believe, contrary to recent pharmaceutical fashion, that molecules from nature hold promise against hard-to-treat diseases.  The Food and Drug Administration's approval of Halaven in November for treating late-stage breast cancer was a triumph of chemistry and tenacious research. Its path, extending nearly three decades from the first studies, demonstrates not only potential benefits but also some of the hurdles in the hunt within nature's bounty for drugs of the future.  Eisai Co.'s Halaven, approved for treating late-stage breast cancer, is derived from a substance in a Japanese black sponge. Yasunori Saito, Ph.D.  Secret Sources 1. Quinine, made from bark of the cinchona tree, has been used for centuries to treat malaria. 2. The chemical salicylic acid, found in willow bark, was the basis for the development of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid). 3. Cyclosporin, isolated from soil samples, is an immunesuppressant used to prevent transplanted-organ rejection. 4. The diabetes drug Byetta, approved in 2005, derives from a hormone of the Gila monster, a lizard of the southwest U.S. 5. Taxol, a staple of chemotherapy, comes from the Pacific yew tree.  Primitive creatures developed many clever ways to kill each other after billions of years of evolution, and some can be turned to human use. ""Weapons of mass destruction are alive and well on a coral reef,"" says David Newman of the National Cancer Institute, who has studied the subject for decades.  Halaven derives from halichondrin B, a substance identified in a black sponge that lives off the coast of Japan. Studies showed it has a powerful effect on tumors, blocking cell division in a way that scientists hadn't previously thought of.  Yoshito Kishi, a Harvard University chemistry professor, synthesized halichondrin B with funding from the National Cancer Institute. His work galvanized researchers at Eisai of Japan, who identified the active part of the molecule and, working with Dr. Kishi, went on to create the drug. Chemists say Halaven is among the most complex small-molecule drugs ever made commercially.  Dr. Kishi fears younger researchers are ignoring Halaven's lesson. Eisai Co., led by the founder's grandson since 1988, stuck with the Halaven research despite nearly dropping it more than once. ""If the CEO changes every 10 years, then this type of project couldn't go through,"" Dr. Kishi says.  Big pharmaceutical companies used to have entire sections devoted to research on natural products, and they yielded some major anticancer drugs. Taxol, from the Pacific yew tree, is a staple chemotherapy drug; another set of widely used drugs derives from the Madagascar periwinkle plant. Yet despite popular notions about the miracle cures lying in the Amazon, many companies over the past decade have scaled back research into potential natural sources.  Recently, rather than start with nature, many corporate scientists have been starting with a target, the particular process in cancerous cells that goes awry. They look for drugs, typically synthetic or semi-synthetic molecules cooked up by humans, that can block the target process.  This type of search holds out hope of a cure, rather than simply extending life. Halaven, meanwhile, is no cure. A study found it extended the life of patients with advanced breast cancer by about two-and-1/2 months, to 13 months.  At first it was hard to gather enough of the sponge molecule for research, let alone for studies on animals. The National Cancer Institute in the 1990s teamed up with the government of New Zealand to harvest a ton of sponges just to get a few hundred milligrams.  Cancer drugs from nature tend to have nasty side effects. Typically they work by blocking cell division, using a chemical ""weapon"" that one bacterium or fungus may use against another. When these drugs work, they also harm healthy cells. And in the most difficult tumors, they may lose effectiveness, as cancerous cells develop resistance.  That's why research into targeted drugs is center stage at large companies. ""Natural-products discovery is a small-company endeavor nowadays,"" says Ken Lloyd of Nereus Pharmaceuticals Inc., of San Diego, which is awaiting data from mid-stage trials of a lung-cancer drug derived from a marine fungus.  The fashion for targeted therapies also may have its blind spots. Some targeted therapies also offer only a few extra months of life. The best-known, Novartis AG 's Gleevec, which went on the market in 2001, works by turning off the protein blamed for triggering chronic myeloid leukemia, a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. Gleevec has produced a nearly 90% five-year survival rate in patients, and 2010 sales were on track to top $4 billion.

(Reuters Health) - Taking one or two baby aspirins a day for at least five years was tied to a lower risk of colorectal cancer in a study from Denmark.  Bayer brand aspirin is seen on display at the Safeway store in Wheaton, Maryland February 13, 2015. REUTERS/Gary Cameron  Earlier studies had suggested that aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen may help protect against colorectal cancer, but it wasn’t clear how much had to be taken, and for how long, to achieve those benefits.  Now, using data on more than 113,000 individuals, researchers have been trying to sort out the relationship between aspirin and NSAIDs, duration of treatment, and colorectal cancer rates.  In general, the risk of developing colorectal cancer varies with age, race, ethnicity and lifestyle. More than 90 percent of cases are diagnosed in people older than 50, according to the National Cancer Institute.  An online risk calculator from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (available here: 1.usa.gov/1DlscTL) indicates that in the U.S., for an average white or black woman in her late fifties, the 10-year risk of developing colorectal cancer is between 1 and 1.4 percent, and her lifetime risk is between 5 and 5.4 percent. For an average black or white male of the same age, the corresponding risks would be about 1.4 percent and 5.8 percent.  In the new study from Denmark, taking low-dose aspirin continuously for at least five years appeared to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer by 27%, and using nonaspirin NSAIDs for at least five years appeared to reduce it by 30%.  On the other hand, merely having taken aspirin did not alter the colorectal cancer risk, they reported in Annals of Internal Medicine.  “Unless low-dose aspirin is taken continuously, there is little protection against colorectal cancer,” Dr. Soren Friis from the Danish Cancer Society Research Center in Copenhagen told Reuters Health.  Nonaspirin NSAIDs were also protective against colorectal cancer with consistent long-term use, “and there was some indication that even non-continuous use of these agents may be (marginally) effective for the prevention of colorectal cancer,” Dr. Friis said.  Aspirin and NSAIDs carry their own risks, however. Long-term use can cause gastrointestinal bleeding, for example, so the potential reduction in colon cancer risk needs to be balanced against potential side effects, the authors warn.  The study had several limitations. For instance, the researchers only had data for users who obtained their aspirin or NSAIDs from doctors’ prescriptions. They didn’t include patients who made over-the-counter purchases of the medicines. Also, the researchers can’t rule out the possibility that other factors may have increased participants’ risk for colorectal cancer, such as obesity, dietary habits, alcohol use, and family history of colorectal cancer.  Dr. Friis emphasized that people should not start taking aspirin or NSAIDs on the basis of the new findings.  “Self-medication with aspirin or non-aspirin NSAIDs is strongly discouraged, due to the possibility of serious adverse events,” Dr. Friis said. “The public should not take any medication regularly without consulting with a physician.”  Dr. Gurpreet Singh Ranger from Upper River Valley Hospital, Waterville, New Brunswick and Dalhousie Medical School, in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada, agreed with Dr. Friis.  “Low dose aspirin, already taken regularly by millions, reduces the risk of colorectal cancer,” he told Reuters Health by email. But “before starting to take aspirin long term, it is important to discuss the implications with your family doctor or specialist.”  SOURCE: bit.ly/1i46lF7 Annals of Internal Medicine, online August 24, 2015.	0
"Sept. 28, 2010 -- An experimental rheumatoid arthritis treatment helps two-thirds of patients getting too little relief from methotrexate. The drug, from a company called Rigel, is R788 or fostamatinib disodium. The oral drug targets an enzyme called Syk. Nobody is exactly sure of the role Syk plays in rheumatoid arthritis. But there's an overabundance of Syk in the fluid of arthritic joints, and the enzyme is part of the runaway immune machinery that increases joint inflammation.  Experimental Drug Fights RA In a pilot study, the drug appeared to reduce symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Now Harvard researcher Michael E. Weinblatt, MD, reports results from a phase II clinical trial in which 457 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate treatment received R788 or placebo for six months. For patients treated with the more active twice-daily dose of 100 milligrams of R788: 67% had at least 20% fewer arthritis symptoms, compared to 35% of patients getting a placebo.  43% had at least 50% fewer arthritis symptoms, compared to 19% getting a placebo.  28% had at least 70% fewer arthritis symptoms, compared to 10% getting a placebo.  R788 Side Effects The drug does have side effects. Among patients getting the twice-daily 100 milligram dose: 19% had diarrhea, compared to 3% getting a placebo.  14% had upper respiratory infections, compared to 7% getting a placebo.  6% had low white blood cell counts, compared to 1% getting a placebo.  23% had to start or increase blood pressure medication, compared to 7% getting a placebo. There's at least one theoretical concern about R788. Normally, the Syk enzyme helps suppress tumors. Women with breast tumors have low levels of Syk. It's not clear whether long-term use of R788 will increase cancer risk; longer-term clinical trials will have to evaluate this risk. For now, R788 looks very promising, the researchers report. ""Inhibition of the Syk pathway offers a new drug target for rheumatoid arthritis,"" Weinblatt and colleagues conclude. The Weinblatt study and an editorial by NIH researchers Juan Rivera, PhD, and Robert A. Colbert, MD, PhD, appear in the Sept. 30 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Rigel funded the study, and three of the study's six authors are Rigel employees. Weinblatt reports receiving grants, fees, or honoraria from a number of drug and biomedical companies, including Rigel."	1
"Is it time for you to begin screening for colorectal cancer? Screening looks for signs of cancer in someone who doesn't have any symptoms. The idea is that by catching cancer early, before it spreads, it's easier to treat.  Stool Screening Tests  One way to look for signs of colorectal cancer is to see if there are microscopic amounts of blood in the stool using a high-sensitivity fecal occult blood test, or FOBT. Occult, in this case, means hidden. ""It's an indirect indicator the patient could be harboring polyps [precancerous growths in the colon],"" says Dr. Sreeram Maddipatla, medical oncologist/hematologist for the Liver Center and Pancreas Center at UF Health Cancer Center – Orlando Health. Although blood in the stool can mean there's a tumor or polyps, it can also be a sign of something much less serious, like hemorrhoids.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved two types of fecal occult blood tests and one stool DNA test:  Guaiac FOBT. This was the first stool test for colorectal screening, says Dr. Robin Mendelsohn, a gastroenterologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Mendelsohn says the concept for the guaiac FOBT originated from the idea that colon cancer bled into the colon and then into the stool. Guaiac FOBT detects heme – an iron compound in the blood that carries oxygen – in the stool. The guaiac FOBT is not specific to human heme, Mendelsohn says, so if you consume meat before the test, it could affect the results.  To do a guaiac FOBT, you'll use a kit to collect stool from three different bowel movements and send the samples to a lab for analysis. ""[The need for three samples] is due to the intermittent nature of bleeding from a tumor,"" Mendelsohn says. If you choose this method of colorectal screening, you'll need to repeat the test yearly.  When a guaiac FOBT is performed every one to two years in adults 50 to 80 years old, it can reduce deaths from colorectal cancer by 15 to 33 percent, according to the National Cancer Institute.  Fecal immunochemical test, or FIT. The FIT detects human hemoglobin, Maddipatla says. It doesn't react to non-human blood, so there are no dietary restrictions prior to the test. Maddipatla says this test is easier than the guaiac FOBT, as it only requires one stool sample (which must be mailed back to the lab right away for an accurate result). Although other conditions, such as a lower gastrointestinal bleed, can produce a positive result, the FIT produces fewer false positives than the guaiac FOBT, Maddipatla says, and is almost equal to colonoscopy in reducing mortality from colorectal cancer. The FIT is approximately 80 percent sensitive for detecting cancer and 20 to 30 percent sensitive for detecting advanced polyps. ""The colonoscopy is still the gold standard,"" Maddipatla says.  Unlike a colonoscopy – a visual examination of the full length of the colon and rectum – the guiaic FOBT and FIT only detect cancers or polyps. A colonoscopy can help prevent cancer by removing polyps before they have a chance to develop into a tumor.  Many patients prefer the simplicity of stool testing to undergoing a colonoscopy. However, if you have a positive result with either a guaiac FOBT or FIT, you may have polyps or colon cancer, and you'll need to proceed with a diagnostic colonoscopy, Mendelsohn says. ""There's no point in doing [stool tests] if you're not willing to do a colonoscopy afterwards.""  FIT-DNA. You may have seen advertisements for the Cologuard FIT-DNA test. According to the NCI, Cologuard detects both tiny amounts of blood in the stool (the FIT portion) as well as nine biomarkers in three genes that have been found in colorectal cancer and advanced polyps. The NCI says for average-risk adults who didn't have symptoms, the FIT-DNA test detected more cancers and adenomas (advanced polyps) than the FIT, but had more false positives.  Mendelsohn says there are no long-term studies on FIT-DNA, so doctors aren't sure how frequently patients should undergo it. Medicare reimburses for the test every three years, she says, and depending on the manufacturer, the guidelines recommend repeating the test every one to three years. Mendelsohn says she is uncomfortable with the rate of false positives, which is about 10 to 13 percent. As with the guiaic FOBT and the FIT, a positive result means you still need to undergo a colonoscopy.  The Bottom Line  Adults at average risk for colorectal cancer should begin colorectal screening at age 50. Talk to your doctor about which test is right for you.  The Affordable Care Act and Medicare cover screening for colorectal cancer. Check with your insurer about which tests are covered and what your out-of-pocket costs might be."	0
"En Español  THURSDAY, Jan. 22, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- A therapy involving ""video feedback"" -- where parents watch videos of their interactions with their baby -- might help prevent infants at risk for autism from developing the disorder, a new study suggests.  The research involved 54 families of babies who were at increased risk for autism because they had an older sibling with the condition.  Some of the families were assigned to a therapy program in which a therapist used video feedback to help parents understand and respond to their infant's individual communication style.  The goal of the therapy -- delivered over five months while the infants were ages 7 to 10 months -- was to improve the infant's attention, communication, early language development, and social engagement.  Other families were assigned to a control group that received no therapy.  After five months, infants in the families in the video therapy group showed improvements in attention, engagement and social behavior, according to the study published Jan. 22 in The Lancet Psychiatry.  Using the therapy during the baby's first year of life may ""modify the emergence of autism-related behaviors and symptoms,"" lead author Jonathan Green, a professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at the University of Manchester in England, said in a journal news release.  ""Children with autism typically receive treatment beginning at 3 to 4 years old,"" he explained. ""But our findings suggest that targeting the earliest risk markers of autism -- such as lack of attention or reduced social interest or engagement -- during the first year of life may lessen the development of these symptoms later on.""  Two experts agreed that early intervention is key.  ""Research has shown that subtle markers of autism are identifiable in the first year of life,"" explained Dr. Ron Marino, associate chair of pediatrics at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, N.Y. ""Video feedback seems like a natural and potentially very potent extension of intervention when it can be most effective,"" he added.  Dr. Andrew Adesman is chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York, in New Hyde Park, N.Y. He was cautiously optimistic about the promise of the video feedback approach.  ""Although it would be wonderful if a relatively simple, video-based intervention could reduce the recurrence risk of autism spectrum disorder in later offspring, further studies are needed to examine this very issue,"" he said. Those studies ""will need to include a larger, more diverse sample population and need to look at developmental outcomes over a much longer period of time.""  More information  The U.S. National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke has more about autism."	1
In a long-term study of the latest treatment for peanut allergy, scientists in Australia report that an immune-based therapy helped children allergic to peanuts eat them without reactions for four years.  The study, published in the journal Lancet Child & Adolescent Health, follows up on children enrolled in an earlier study of an immunotherapy treatment, which combined probiotics with small doses of peanuts that were designed to gradually train the children’s immune systems to accept the peanut allergen rather than treat it as something foreign. Previous studies have suggested that methods like these could be effective in reducing youngsters’ allergic, sometimes dangerous anaphylactic shock reactions to peanuts. The Australian team added probiotics to further enhance the gut’s ability to accept the peanuts and not trigger an immune reaction. Compared to 4% of children who didn’t get any treatment, 82% of those receiving the combination therapy significantly reduced their allergic reactions to peanuts.  MORE: Babies Should Eat Eggs and Peanuts Early to Avoid Food Allergies  In the follow-up, which tracked the children for four years after they were treated with the combination therapy, 67% of those who got the combination probiotic and peanut therapy were comfortable eating peanuts, compared to only 4% of those who did not get the treatment. Fewer children in the treated group had an allergic reaction to the peanuts, and they also showed smaller reactions to skin prick tests with peanut allergen.  The results are encouraging, allowing the children who were treated to eat peanuts without fear of an allergic reaction. But it may be too early to call this a cure. The researchers believe that adding probiotics to the peanut allergens may be important in improving the children’s tolerance to the food, but Dr. Anna Nowak-Wegrzyn, an associate professor of pediatrics at Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai Hospital who was not involved in the study, notes that the researchers didn’t compare the effect of the probiotics themselves; they only compared children who received the probiotics along with immune therapy to those who didn’t get any treatment at all.  Health Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips. View Sample Sign Up Now  It makes sense that the probiotics may enhance the immunotherapy’s effect, since probiotics are beneficial bacteria in the gut, where food allergens are processed. “I think there is certainly a suggestion, but not hard proof, that the probiotics make a difference,” says Nowak-Wegrzyn. “The question for me would be if there is a difference between patients who were treated with [both] immunotherapy [in the form of low doses of peanuts] and probiotics, and those who were treated with just immunotherapy.”  That may have to wait for another study. But the new findings provide even more evidence that using peanuts to treat peanut allergy, and to re-train the immune system to be less allergic, can be effective.  Contact us at editors@time.com.	1
"(CNN) Sometimes, Ellis Glover would be forced to leave her friends and sit at a lunch table where no one was eating peanut butter and jelly sandwiches.  ""I wanted to sit with my good, good friends, but I couldn't,"" the 10-year-old said. ""If you're a kid and you have a food allergy, it's harder on you. You're missing out on a lot of stuff other children can have. I always want to try peanut stuff.""  Mom Monica Glover said the family discovered Ellis' peanut allergy when she was about 3. The tipoff: a skin reaction around her mouth after she was given food with a small amount of peanuts in it. ""We were lucky to have discovered it that way. That was a mild reaction,"" Glover said, and a doctor confirmed the allergy through tests.  The discovery was ""distressing,"" Glover said. Accidental exposure to peanuts has happened, resulting in ""severe stomach cramps and vomiting,"" she said. ""Essentially, we have to live in fear all the time of Ellis being inadvertently exposed to peanuts and having a reaction that is potentially life-threatening.""  Glover seized the opportunity to participate in a study on the safety and effectiveness of an experimental treatment that could give her daughter protection against accidental exposure to peanuts. Despite the risk, it was ""a gift,"" she said, adding that her family hoped their efforts might help ""lots of other children.""  The risk paid off: Two-thirds of the kids in the study were able to eat the equivalent of two peanuts without any symptoms after following the months-long experimental treatment regimen, the researchers found.  Ellis is one of the majority of children for whom the treatment works. ""It's been a huge success,"" her mother said.  The study results, published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the American College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology's Annual Scientific Meeting, prove that the treatment can protect some children against accidental exposure to or ingestion of a very small amount of peanuts or peanut products.  Not a cure  Dr. Brian Vickery, the study's lead author, director of the Children's Healthcare of Atlanta Food Allergy Program and an associate professor of pediatrics at the Emory University School of Medicine, cautioned that ""it's not a cure.""  ""It does not make the allergy to go away,"" Vickery said. ""The purpose is not to get them to be no longer peanut allergic and allow them to eat whatever they want.""  Still, that's no small accomplishment, he said. There are no US Food and Drug Administration-approved treatment options for food allergies of any kind or peanut allergy in particular, which, along with tree nut allergy, affects an estimated 3 million Americans or more.  ""I'm telling patients when I see them that my hope is that patients will have access by late next summer, something like that,"" Vickery said. He added that although the study proved the treatment's effectiveness and safety only in children, adults would probably benefit in the same way.  How the study worked  To test the experimental therapy, 66 research centers in 10 countries recruited 551 participants who ranged in age from 4 to 55 and who all had a peanut allergy. Most -- 499 participants -- were between the ages of 4 and 17.  The treatment , which comes in powder-filled capsules, is an oral immunotherapy, and the concept is ""treating an allergy by gradually exposing people to the very same thing they're allergic to,"" Vickery said. Essentially, the treatment is a peanut powder.  Ellis participated in the study at the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit at Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock, which was overseen by Dr. Stacie M. Jones, a professor of pediatrics and chief of allergy and immunology at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences and Arkansas Children's Hospital.  Ellis and Monica Glover in the Pediatric Clinical Research Unit at Arkansas Children's Hospital in Little Rock.  ""We were extremely well-informed about the entire process,"" Glover said. ""You start at a super low dose and work your way up. You take it at the hospital under observation. Then, you take it at home every day. ""  Three-quarters of the study participants were given the treatment in increasing amounts every two weeks until reaching maintenance, when they received the equivalent of one peanut daily. The remainder of the participants were given a placebo. At the conclusion of the study after a year, all of the participants faced an ""exit food challenge"": They ate, under a doctor's supervision, the equivalent of two peanuts.  Two-thirds of the treatment participants were able to tolerate this exit dose without a severe reaction. Half tolerated even twice that amount: a four-peanut dose.  Overall, participants experienced fewer side effects during the study than the researchers had anticipated. ""It's intuitive that that process would trigger some allergic symptoms in many patients,"" Vickery said. A third completed the study with no more than mild side effects, su"	0
"May 11, 2012 -- Starting your day off with an egg may help curb your appetite better than cereal, new research suggests.  In a small study, it took longer for people who ate eggs for breakfast to show signs of hunger than it did for those who had a bowl of ready-to-eat cereal.  Scientists suspect that egg protein may be better at making people feel full longer compared to the protein found in wheat.  For people hoping to shed some pounds, changing the type of protein in the diet, rather than the amount of it, is an idea the researchers think deserves more study as a weight loss strategy.  ""This study shows that diets with higher protein quality may enhance satiety, leading to better compliance and success of a weight loss diet,"" researcher Nikhil Dhurandhar, PhD, says in a news release. He is an associate professor in the department of infection and obesity at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, La.  One large egg has about 70 calories, and it contains about 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of fat, and 186 milligrams of cholesterol.  The research was funded by the American Egg Board, and will be presented at the19th European Congress on Obesity in Lyon, France."	1
"July 30, 2012 -- If it weren't for routine PSA prostate cancer screening, an extra 17,000 Americans each year would learn that they had the worst form of the disease, a new study suggests.  That kind of prostate cancer -- metastatic prostate cancer, in which the cancer spreads to the bone or other parts of the body -- is rapidly fatal, usually within two years or less.  The new study seems to make a powerful argument in favor of PSA testing. It finds that in the three years before widespread PSA testing (1983-1985), men getting their first diagnosis of prostate cancer were three times more likely to learn they had very late-stage cancer than men diagnosed in the most recent three years for which data is available (2006-2008).  ""By not using PSA tests in the vast majority of men, you have to accept you are going to increase very serious metastatic disease threefold,"" says study leader Edward Messing, MD, chief of urology at the University of Rochester Medical Center.  In 2008, about 8,000 U.S. men were diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer. By projecting data from the pre-PSA era forward, Messing calculates that without routine PSA tests, 25,000 men would have been diagnosed in 2008 -- an extra 17,000 cases of deadly disease.  But it's not that simple, says Barnett Kramer, MD, MPH, associate director for disease prevention at the National Institutes of Health. Studies looking back at cancer trends in a population are very unreliable when it comes to showing what caused those trends.  For example, Kramer says, what if a man got a PSA test when his prostate cancer was in the very earliest stages of metastatic disease? Microscopic cancers already have seeded his body. But he would not yet have symptoms or detectable metastatic disease, so he'd be diagnosed with earlier-stage disease. He's subtracted forever from the men whose first diagnosis was late-stage disease, even though screening could not save his life.  Messing says this misses the point of his study, which appears in the online July 30 issue of the journal Cancer."	0
"Screening patients for heart disease with a heart-imaging test prompted greater follow-up care but had little to no effect on the number of heart attacks and other cardiovascular events in those patients, a new study found.  Researchers at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore led the study, which was published online Monday in the Archives of Internal Medicine.  John McEvoy, a heart specialist at Johns Hopkins Hospital and the lead author, said doctors are looking for ""optimum use"" of a non-invasive imaging test called coronary computed tomographic angiography, called a CCTA test and also known as CT angiography.  Researchers wanted to know whether finding plaque buildup at an early stage slows the progression of heart disease and reduce heart attacks in patients who aren't showing symptoms of heart disease.  CT angiography is a rapidly growing technology. Michael Lauer, director of the cardiovascular-sciences division at the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, wrote in a commentary accompanying the CCTA study, ""We cannot simply assume that just because a screening test predicts clinical outcomes, interventions necessarily will prevent them.""  The study of CCTA screening comes as medical experts are re-evaluating the frequency and usefulness of other types of health screening, including mammographies for women and PSA testing for prostate cancer in men.  The CCTA test isn't currently a common screening test for heart disease, and American Heart Association guidelines recommend against such use of it. Still, Dr. Lauer said such use is likely to grow. The test costs from $600 to $1,000 per patient, researchers say.  Dr. Lauer said the heart, lung and blood institute is funding separate studies of CCTA involving patients with chest pain and other symptoms of heart disease to better define how to use the test.  For now, most doctors assess risk for coronary heart disease using blood tests to measure cholesterol and other fats in the blood, and then in some cases prescribe medication to lower cholesterol. Imaging tests often are reserved for patients with chest pain or other heart-disease signs.  In a CCTA test, patients are injected with dye and then undergo a scan, which creates three-dimensional images of the heart and blood vessels. The images show plaque and other deposits that often build up inside blood vessels and can lead to heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems.  The test differs from a coronary angiogram or a cardiac catheterization, in which a catheter is inserted into a blood vessel in the arm or leg and then guided into the heart to look for blockages or narrowing of blood vessels.  In contrast, the CCTA scan isn't invasive, and for that reason some medical experts say it has potential to be widely used for screening healthy patients for heart disease. Some anecdotal evidence suggests such screening is happening and becoming more common.  The researchers looked at patients who weren't considered high risk but did exhibit some risk factors for heart disease. Almost all adults over age 50 likely have some plaque in their arteries, he said.  The study involved 2,000 patients in South Korea with an average age of 50 taking part in a health-screening program. The study compared 1,000 individuals who underwent a CCTA exam with 1,000 who didn't undergo the test.  It found 215 patients who underwent the exam had a positive result, meaning they were found to have plaque in their blood vessels. These patients were 10 times as likely to have been sent for an exercise stress test, a nuclear medicine scan or a cardiac catheterization as patients who didn't have the CCTA test.  The patients also were three times as likely to be taking a statin medication, and four times as likely to be on aspirin therapy, both designed to lower risk of heart attack.  After 18 months, the study showed, one person in the CCTA group developed a heart problem known as unstable angina and one person in the non-testing group had a fatal heart attack.  ""Our findings suggest that low-risk patients without symptoms don't benefit in the short term from knowing whether or not plaque has been detected using CT angiography,"" Dr. McEvoy said. ""However, their physicians may be inclined to be more aggressive with prescriptions or follow-up tests.""  Patients would have to be followed for a longer period to look at whether there's a true difference in heart events and heart-related deaths between the two groups, Dr. McEvoy said.

"Feb. 7, 2011 -- Giving your sweetie chocolate for Valentine's Day may show you care for their health as well as their heart.  A new study suggests that dark chocolate and cocoa powder may be the next ""super foods"" thanks to their high antioxidant content.  Researchers found the antioxidant activity of dark chocolate and cocoa powder was equivalent to or higher than that found in some other so-called “super fruit"" powders or juices, including acai berry, blueberry, cranberry, and pomegranate.  Antioxidants are a group of compounds known to fight the damaging effects of oxidative stress on cells within the body and are increasingly thought to have many heart-healthy properties.  Two groups of antioxidants in particular, polyphenols and flavonols, which are found in various fruits and seeds, have been the focus of much research due to their potentially healthy effects. Foods and fruits high in these antioxidants have been dubbed as ""super foods"" or ""super fruits"" by the media.  ""These substances help keep the arteries healthy and are protective against cardiovascular disease,"" says preventive cardiologist Suzanne Steinbaum, MD, of Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, in an email. ""When looking for a sweet snack, a square of dark chocolate might, in fact, be your healthiest choice!""  Cocoa or cacao beans are not beans but the seeds of the fruit of the Theobroma cacao tree.

"(CNN) -- As a thick, gray haze began to descend over the words in her schoolbooks, and eventually the faces of loved ones, Barbara Campbell barely grasped that she was going blind.  ""I didn't realize that I wasn't seeing the same as everybody else, because how would I know that?"" said Campbell, 56, who began losing her sight in middle school.  By the time Campbell reached adulthood, her vision was gone.  ""It's like looking through a frosted window,"" Campbell said of how she sees the world. ""It's like that all the time.""  Doctors diagnosed retinitis pigmentosa, a progressive eye disease that damages the cells of the retina, the part of the eye that detects light.  For years, Campbell survived -- even thrived -- as a blind woman navigating New York City. Then earlier this year, she went from coping with blindness to hoping she might see again.  Campbell is one of only 14 people in the United States participating in an FDA-approved study of an artificial retina -- a microchip implanted in the eye to stimulate damaged cells.  ""Amazing,"" said Campbell with a smile. ""It's like 'Star Trek.' ""  A microchip to help someone see may sound more like a ""Star Trek"" device than legitimate science, but it is real.  ""This is really the first step toward a really bionic eye,"" said Aries Arditi, a senior fellow in vision science at Lighthouse International, a nonprofit advocacy group for the blind and one of the study sites for the artificial retina.  A healthy retina sends electrical signals to the brain, telling it how to decipher light. A damaged retina cannot transmit those signals, so the artificial retina is outfitted with rows of tiny electrodes to do the job.  In July, Campbell underwent surgery to implant the microchip into her eye.  ""When light goes into [Campbell's] eyes, she doesn't see anything, because it's not being projected by the cells of the retina,"" said Dr. Lucian Del Priore, an ophthalmologist at New York Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, who implanted Campbell's artificial retina.  ""This is an artificial device that essentially stimulates the retina electrically,"" Del Priore said.  How to see a tree artificially  Since her eyes cannot detect light or images on their own, Campbell wears a pair of sunglasses outfitted with a small camera. As she scans and focuses the camera on an object in her environment -- for example, a tree -- a wireless device transmits that image to the artificial retina inside her eye.  The electrodes on the microchip then stimulate cells on the retina roughly in the shape of the tree. The shape is communicated to the brain -- the idea being that Campbell might one day perceive some semblance of a shape of that tree.  ""It's a rudimentary level of vision,"" said Brian Mech, vice president of business development at Second Sight Medical Products Inc., the developer and manufacturer of the artificial retina. ""But for people without vision, that can be pretty remarkable.""  In 2002, the first-generation artificial retina had only 16 electrodes.  ""Patients were able to do things that we would not have anticipated with so few electrodes,"" Mech said. ""One patient could shoot baskets, and another was crossing crosswalks.""  Campbell received one of the second-generation artificial retinas with 60 electrodes, and thus far, according to her doctors, has made significant progress.  When she stands outside her apartment building, she can now sense light emanating from windows. Navigating up the stairs of her building, she now knows that there is light illuminating the hallways. And when she arrives home and makes tea, she can sense light coming from the burners on the stove.  And just recently, during a vision test, Campbell was able to correctly identify a sequence of letters for the first time in decades.  ""I was like, 'You're kidding,' "" Campbell said. ""I was shocked. I still can't believe it.""  Campbell's doctors try to temper her excitement and that of other study participants.  ""Being able to repair, in some way, a function that has been lost is a very exciting thing,"" Del Priore said. ""But it is important to be realistic.""  Recognizing faces, driving or reading the small print in newspapers is a very long way off, Mech said. And while some patients like Campbell do well with the implant, there are some who struggle.  Still, the feeling among those involved in the study is tempered excitement.  ""We can now take someone who is totally blind and turn them into someone with very, very poor vision,"" said Arditi, who trains Campbell weekly on how to nurture her vision. ""That's really the first time in history we've been able to do that.""  Devices with 100 and 1,000 electrodes are in production, and the hope, Mech said, is that more electrodes will mean more-detailed vision.  Today, the artificial retina is primarily for sufferers of retinitis pigmentosa, but it could expand to other diseases, like dry age-related macular degeneration, Mech said.  There are 100,000 people in the Un"	1
Paxil or Prozac, Zoloft or Lexapro?  When treating a patient suffering from depression, Brent Forester considers which anti-depressant to prescribe—ideally, one that will ease psychic pain without side effects.  It can be a tough call.  Deciding “becomes somewhat of an art—and a lot of it is educated guesswork,” says Dr. Forester, chief of geriatric psychiatry at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Mass., an affiliate of Harvard Medical School. He worries that sometimes psychiatrists “may think we are better than we really are” at making these choices.  McLean Hospital psychiatrists Brent Forester, left, and Ipsit Vahia, are occasionally using genomics to help inform decisions about prescribing anti-depressants. Photo: McLean Hospital  That may change as Dr. Forester and others enlist genomics, a form of precision medicine and an intriguing new frontier for the elusive science of the human psyche. Other branches of medicine, such as oncology, have embraced gene-based testing to help determine which cancer patients need chemotherapy or surgery. But psychiatrists typically haven’t let genomics guide treatment decisions, Dr. Forester says.  One test, called GeneSight, uses a genetic analysis of DNA samples from a cheek swab to help doctors figure out which drugs are likely to combat a patient’s depression. The test examines a dozen genes to determine how well the patient will metabolize certain drugs and how his or her brain will respond to them.  Supplies and paperwork for a GeneSight test, which analyzes DNA samples from a cheek swab to help determine which drugs are likely to combat depression. Photo: Myriad Genetics  The test predicts the effects of more than 50 anti-depressants and anti-psychotics. Based on a patient’s results, drugs are categorized as ones to be avoided, ones that have some drawbacks and ones that can be used “as directed.”  Barbara Dellovade, a retired real estate broker in Acton, Mass., became depressed last year. Ms. Dellovade, who is 78 years old, was taking an anti-depressant, but “I wasn’t reacting well to it and it wasn’t helping me at all.” She consulted Ipsit Vahia, a geriatric psychiatrist at McLean Hospital and assistant professor at Harvard Medical School.  More The Food That Helps Battle Depression  Dr. Vahia told Ms. Dellovade about the genomics test, which retails for $1,500 and is covered by Medicare and some health plans. After receiving an analysis of Ms. Dellovade’s results, he switched her to a different anti-depressant and she began to respond in about six weeks, he says. Ms. Dellovade has been feeling better, she says, though “I am still not there.”  Dr. Vahia has been using the gene test more with his older depressed patients but says clinical judgment remains paramount in prescribing. “The brain...is the most complex organ in the body,” he says. “This is a small step, but it is an important step. We are adding a degree of precision” to treating depression.  McLean Hospital is one of 60 sites across the country that took part in a randomized trial of GeneSight. The results, which will be unveiled this week at the American Psychiatric Association meeting, showed that patients fared better when physicians chose a medication with the help of the test, rather than relying solely on their judgment.  Among the 1,167 patients in the trial, half took the GeneSight test and half were prescribed drugs based purely on their doctors’ clinical assessments. Genetics helps you “marry” a patient with the appropriate medication, says Bryan Dechairo, executive vice president for clinical development at Myriad Genetics, which funded the trial. Assurex Health, a subsidiary of Myriad Genetics, developed the GeneSight test.  The results were striking, according to doctors at several medical centers who participated in the trial. Patients were more likely to respond to anti-depressants when the gene test was used to determine which drug they should be on; researchers found a 30% greater response to the medicine when the test was applied. Every patient in the trial had been on at least one anti-depressant that failed to work, and some had been on several that failed.  John Greden, the principal investigator in the GeneSight trial, is a psychiatrist and executive director of the University of Michigan’s Comprehensive Depression Center. Photo: University of Michigan  The study shows that genetic tests can lead to better prescribing decisions, says John Greden, the principal investigator in the trial. Dr. Greden, a psychiatrist and executive director of the University of Michigan’s Comprehensive Depression Center, says that until now, many doctors took the following approach: “My favorite anti-depressant is this one, so I will try it. Oh, that didn’t work, so I will try this one.”  Unfortunately, he says, under that hit-or-miss method—albeit informed by training and experience—“fewer than 40% of patients achieve remission.” Every year, 16 million Americans suffer an episode of depression, he says, m	0
NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Using chest scans to screen for lung cancer in people who’ve never smoked and have no symptoms might help catch cancers early and decrease the disease’s death toll, suggests a new study from Japan.  But experts say the findings likely don’t apply in non-Asian countries, where the majority of all lung cancers are found in people who smoke — and where using computed tomography (CT) scans to screen for lung cancer in smokers has recently been a controversial topic.  Moreover, they warn that while regular screening might help doctors catch cancer earlier, it also comes with a high price tag and added risks to patients.  CT scanning uses X-rays and computers to produce a clearer image than traditional X-ray techniques, but CT also uses higher radiation doses to generate those images.  Everybody agrees that CT “does find the early stage lung cancer,” said Dr. Heidi Roberts, a lung cancer researcher from Women’s College Hospital, Toronto who wasn’t involved in the new study. Early-stage cancer is easier to treat and has a higher survival rate.  The new study provides further evidence of that. Researchers led by Dr. Ryoichi Kondo of Shinshu University Hospital in Matsumoto looked back at outcomes for close to 500 non-smoking lung cancer patients whose cancer was caught by CT scan screening, or by standard X-ray screening — another strategy for catching cancer early — or when patients came into the doctor with lung symptoms.  Most of the tumors found via CT scans were small, whereas those found through X-ray screening or in patients with symptoms were more often further advanced, according to the findings published in the journal Lung Cancer.  Five years after their diagnosis, 95 percent of people whose cancers were found through a CT scan were still alive, compared to 73 percent diagnosed with an X-ray and 40 percent of patients who had not been screened and whose symptoms led to discovery their disease.  East Asian countries are more likely to regularly screen non-smokers for lung cancer because biological differences seem to put Asians at a higher risk than other non-smokers, researchers explained.  Non-smokers without symptoms generally are not screened for lung cancer in the U.S.  There and in Canada, the lung cancer debate has centered around how often to screen smokers, and until what age screening should be done, Roberts said.  In another study published by Kondo and colleagues — this one looking at lung cancer screening in smokers — five-year survival rates were also highest in those screened with CT scans.  That’s consistent with the findings of the National Lung Screening Trial in the U.S., which in November released data — published online in the New England Journal of Medicine last week — showing that 20 percent fewer middle-aged heavy smokers died of lung cancer when they were screened annually with a CT scan compared to a standard, less detailed chest X-ray.  Lung cancer kills more people in the U.S. than any other cancer — over 150,000 each year.  The problem with frequent screening is not only its cost — CT scans typically run a few hundred dollars each — but that each scan exposes a person to radiation, which also slightly increases cancer risks over time with repeated scans.  And screening comes with an inherent risk of false-positives — scans which suggest a lung cancer that turns out not to be there.  Dr. Christine Berg, one of the leaders of the U.S. screening studies, said that generally about a quarter of chest CT scans show some kind of abnormality — but 96 percent of those abnormal scans turn out not to be lung cancer. While doctors ruled out cancer, those patients would have undergone further tests, sometimes including biopsies, which can cause complications including infection and bleeding.  And for some patients, “if you really weren’t going to benefit from the screening...that complication is something you may not have faced,” Berg said. “Those are some of the things I worry about.”  Her study showed that 300 middle-aged smokers would need to be screened with CT scans to prevent one death from lung cancer.  The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federally-supported expert panel, has said there isn’t enough evidence for it to recommend screening for lung cancer in symptom-free people using CT scans or other methods.  Berg and Roberts both told Reuters Health that more research is needed to see if there might be hints in the blood or genes of smokers that could tell doctors which had the highest risk for lung cancer — and which would get the most out of routine CT screening.  “We now have a technology that can detect (lung cancer) early enough to make some impact,” Berg said. But, “it’s not a home run, and it clearly has these limitations.”  SOURCE: bit.ly/iLARSq Lung Cancer, online June 12, 2011.	0
May 23, 2011 -- Researchers in Europe say a fermented dairy product containing a specific bacterium known as a probiotic did not relieve constipation in children more than a dairy product without a probiotic.  The finding is significant, the researchers say, because probiotics have helped some adults with constipation.  It seemed logical that probiotics, live microorganisms that are often called “friendly” or “good” bacteria, might work for children. But in a new study the kids who consumed the fermented dairy product did no better, based on number of stools produced, than youngsters in a comparison group.  The study examined 159 children with constipation for at least two months with a defecation rate of less than three times per week. About half were given the probiotic product twice daily for three weeks; children in the comparison group were given a dairy product without the probiotic.	0
"Liz Szabo, USA TODAY  A heart disease study presented Sunday is being called a $32 million waste of time — and even a danger to public health — by some of the country's leading health experts.  The taxpayer-funded study tested whether a controversial alternative therapy, called chelation, could reduce heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems in people who had already survived a heart attack.  Chelation therapy, which can remove metals from the blood, is a risky procedure approved to treat rare, life-threatening cases of heavy metal poisoning. Tens of thousands of patients a year undergo the procedure ""off-label,"" however, paying around $5,000 out-of-pocket, based on the claims of doctors who say it can cure everything from Alzheimer's to autism.  National Institutes of Health officials say they launched the study because there has never been any evidence that the practice is effective or safe.  In a presentation Sunday, doctors said the trial found a small overall benefit to chelation, mainly because it prevented heart problems in people with diabetes.  Elliott Antman, chair of the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions program committee, praised NIH for doing the study.  ""Kudos for funding a trial that says, 'OK, if people are lining up to have this done, let's let it undergo rigorous clinical trials,'"" Antman said in an interview before the results were unveiled.  In a statement after the study was presented, Antman, a cardiologist at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, added, ""Intriguing as the results are, they are unexpected and should not be interpreted as an indication to adopt chelation therapy into clinical practice.""  Yet some doctors say the study was far from rigorously performed, and so badly run that its marginally positive results are meaningless.  Cardiologist Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic, one of the USA's most respected heart experts, says he's concerned the study will encourage more patients to get off-label chelation instead of taking proven medications or making lifestyle changes that clearly have been shown to reduce heart disease.  ""This study has the potential to be extremely dangerous,"" Nissen says. Chelation ""should not be administered to any patients for the indication of heart disease. ... There are a lot of people, including me, who believe this was a poor use of taxpayer dollars.""  At least 30 patients have died from off-label chelation therapy since the 1970s, including an autistic 5-year-old Pennsylvania boy, according to a 2008 report in The Medscape Journal of Medicine.  Even the study's lead author says the research should not be used to recommend chelation therapy, and he acknowledges that its findings could have been due to chance.  ""A definitive answer on chelation therapy will take much additional research,"" Gervasio Lamas, chief of the Columbia University division of cardiology at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach, Fla., said in a statement. ""The most exciting part of this study is that there may be an unexpected signal of benefit. We need to understand whether the signal is true, or whether it occurred by chance.""  The trial, known as the Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy, or TACT, has been dogged by accusations of safety and ethical problems from its beginnings 10 years ago.  The study was temporarily halted in 2008 because of concerns over ethics and patient safety. An investigation by the federal Office for Human Research Subject Protections, which is charged with protecting patients, found that patients may not have been properly informed of chelation's risks.  In response to such concerns, researchers revised their consent forms — the documents that explain a study's risks and benefits to patients — which had failed to mention the risk of death in chelation therapy.  Federal officials also ordered researchers to notify patients that the drug they were receiving had never been approved for lead poisoning, as implied in the consent form, and that the Food and Drug Administration had taken the study drug off of its list of approved medications.  Stephen Kopecky, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist who participated in the trial, says he's also concerned about the reliability of its findings.  The overall benefits were very small, with 26.5% of those randomly assigned to chelation experiencing a cardiovascular problem, compared with 30% of those randomly assigned to a placebo infusion. Even more concerning, that benefit passed the bar for statistical significance — the standard for judging whether a result is real or a fluke — by only 0.001.  Further analysis showed the benefits were limited to those with diabetes, rather than for patients overall.  Under the best of circumstances, that's not a strong result, says anesthesiologist Kimball Atwood of Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Massachusetts, who has followed the study from its beginning.  This study's findings are even more questionable, h"	0
HONG KONG (Reuters) - Boosting the effect of acupuncture needles with small electric currents may be effective in treating depression, a study in Hong Kong has found.  Led by Zhang Zhang-jin at the School of Chinese Medicine, University of Hong Kong, the researchers used electroacupuncture to stimulate seven spots on the heads of 73 participants, who had suffered several bouts of depression in the last 7 years.  The electroacupuncture was given in addition to medication that the patients were already taking and meant to augment their treatment, Zhang told a news conference.  Half the patients received electroacupuncture nine times over three weeks, while the other half - the placebo group - only had needles inserted superficially into their heads.  They were later assessed by experts for their depression levels and the group that received genuine electroacupuncture was found to be a lot happier.  “The drop (in depression scores) among the group receiving active treatment was more significant than the placebo group,” said Roger Ng, another researcher in the group, which published their findings in the journal PLoS (Public Library of Science) ONE.  “When the acupoints are stimulated, some brain centres responsible for producing serotonin are stimulated,” explained Ng, a consultant at the department of psychiatry at the Kowloon Hospital in Hong Kong.  An imbalance in serotonin levels is believed to be linked to depression. Depression affects about 20 percent of people at some point in their lives.  The World Health Organisation predicts that by 2020, depression will rival heart disease as the health disorder with the highest disease burden in the world.  Zhang said his group may consider moving into another trial using only electroacupuncture on patients suffering milder depression.	1

"A tiny but promising study suggests that a medicine used for immune disorders may offer long-term benefits to Alzheimer's patients—a result likely to spur demand for the treatment even though it is in limited supply and isn't approved for the memory-debilitating disease.  The treatment, intravenous immunoglobulin therapy, or IVIG, is made from the blood plasma of healthy young adults. Since 2004 it had shown early promise for Alzheimer's, which afflicts some five million Americans.  In the new study, four patients with a mild to moderate form of the disease who had been taking an IVIG drug for three years saw their cognitive ability and behavior stabilize, meaning their symptoms didn't get worse, said Norman Relkin, a neurologist at Weill Cornell Medical College in New York who presented the findings at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Vancouver, British Columbia.  The finding is striking because people diagnosed with Alzheimer's typically see dramatic memory declines within 18 months, if not much sooner.  The patients in the study used a version of IVIG from Baxter International BAX 0.76% Inc. called Gammagard. The results suggest Gammagard ""is a viable long-term therapy in this group"" of Alzheimer's patients, said Dr. Relkin.  These new data represent the longest follow-up to date on patients from Baxter's midstage clinical trial. Earlier results were encouraging enough to prompt the company in 2007 to move Gammagard into late-stage testing for Alzheimer's. Results from this phase III testing are expected in early 2013.  William Thies, chief medical and scientific officer of the Alzheimer's Association, a group that funds research into the disease, called the findings ""tantalizing"" but said more work is needed. Dr. Thies wasn't involved in the study.  It is important to be cautious about the results due to the small sample size and because patients and investigators knew the patients were getting the medicine, which could have influenced the findings, said Rudy Tanzi, a neurology professor at Harvard Medical School.  ""We have to wait for a proper phase III [trial] before we reach a conclusion,"" said Dr. Tanzi, who wasn't involved in the study. ""It's almost like a crapshoot; it's just too small to predict.""  Nevertheless, doctors who work with Alzheimer's patients said they expect patients and families to clamor for the drug. Many said they have been asked about Gammagard for years, and this latest positive result is likely to bring an increase.  In February, when results in mice were published suggesting that a skin-cancer drug, bexarotene, was beneficial for Alzheimer's, many patients or their families started calling their doctors to ask whether they should use it off-label.  A spokesman for Baxter said the company ""does not support the use of its therapies for unapproved indications. Further, it remains difficult to monitor the use of our IG products for Alzheimer's disease.""  Drugs must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration for specific uses, but doctors can prescribe them for other purposes. With any off-label use, there are concerns about safety and efficacy. With Gammagard, there is an additional concern about supply.  IVIG is costly and difficult to make. Baxter, one of several companies that make it, says it takes 130 plasma donations to make enough to treat one patient with primary immunodeficiency for a year.  ""The findings are highly promising but nevertheless a double-edged sword due to the limited supply,"" said P. Murali Doraiswamy, an Alzheimer's researcher at Duke University who wasn't involved in the study but previously served as an adviser to Baxter. ""The growing off-label demand for Alzheimer's could threaten supply for immunodeficient patients.""  It isn't clear how the treatment helps Alzheimer's patients, but it appears to take advantage of antibodies from the plasma donors that combat a protein called amyloid, which clumps in the brains of people with the ailment.  The drug is approved for a number of conditions, particularly diseases of the immune system, and many patients who use it have life-threatening conditions. Multiple companies make IVIG, but only Gammagard is in advanced clinical testing for use in Alzheimer's.  Gayatri Devi, director of New York Memory Services, which treats patients with neurological conditions, has used Gammagard to treat Alzheimer's for about seven years. She says she started trying it after a patient's husband approached her in 2005 after hearing about an early clinical-trial result on TV.Dr. Devi has since treated several other patients with Gammagard, which involves lengthy office infusions every two to three weeks. She says she measures patients' functioning before starting treatment and six months later to see whether they should continue. She began with patients whose functioning seemed to be deteriorating significantly and more recently has started treating mild patients to see if she can slow the disease progres"	0
NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Hormone replacement therapy may work slightly better than soy at reducing menopausal hot flashes, a new study says.  Women who took such hormones had fewer hot flashes, on average, than women who took soy - and both had fewer than those who took a placebo, or “dummy pill.”  “The bottom line for someone who is very disturbed by hot flashes, the best treatment is hormones, and the next tier would be soy,” said Dr. Gloria Bachmann, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Jersey.  However, a 2002 landmark study by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) found that such treatments can increase the risk of breast cancer, heart disease and stroke. That means that if women do take hormones, Bachmann told Reuters Health, it should be the lowest dose and for the shortest possible period of time.  And not every woman needs treatment, notes Bachmann, who was not involved in the study. Women with severe or frequent hot flashes or whose hot flashes keep them up at night, should consider treatment, she said.  Women typically suffer between 30 and 150 hot flashes a month, said Dr. Rafael Bolanos-Diaz, professor of health economics at San Marcos University in Lima, Peru, who co-authored the study.  Women who took hormones had an average of 24 fewer hot flashes per month, while those who took soy had 12 per month fewer. The study did not look at whether eating soy in food has the same effect on hot flashes as supplements, Bolanos-Diaz said.  The researchers looked at 19 studies on how a treatment, either hormones or soy, compared to a placebo. They compared the average number of hot flashes in 760 women who had treatment with 770 who did not.  The study was published in Menopause: The Journal of the North American Menopause Society.  Soy hasn’t been studied as much as hormone replacement to treat hot flashes, and doctors don’t know exactly how it works. It’s thought to have similar effects to estrogen on the brain, bones, and blood vessels, Bolanos-Diaz told Reuters Health by email.  Soy supplements also have side effects: Nausea, bloating, and constipation, according to the NIH. A month’s supply costs about $12, while a month of hormone tablets runs between $40 and $60.  “For some women, hormone therapy is the best option, for some soy is best, and for some, it’s just watchful waiting until the hot flashes subside,” Bachmann said.

"A new study claims that consuming one avocado a day as part of a moderate-fat diet could help lower bad cholesterol among people who are overweight or obese.  Share on Pinterest Consuming one avocado a day alongside a moderate-fat diet was found to lower 'bad' cholesterol among overweight and obese individuals.  The researchers, including senior author Penny M. Kris-Etherton, PhD, distinguished professor of nutrition at Pennsylvania State University, publish their findings in the Journal of the American Heart Association.  It is well known that avocados are high in fat, but the majority of an avocado's fat is monounsaturated, which is deemed a ""good"" type of fat. It is known that monounsaturated fats can help lower levels of bad cholesterol, reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke.  For their study, Kris-Etherton and colleagues set out to assess how avocado consumption - by replacing saturated fatty acids, or ""bad"" fats - affected risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases.  The team recruited 45 healthy participants aged 21-70 years who were either obese or overweight.  Every participant was required to follow each of three cholesterol-lowering diets for 5 weeks. The diets consisted of a lower-fat diet without avocado, a moderate-fat diet without avocado or a moderate-fat diet with one Hass avocado a day.  Prior to starting each diet, subjects ate what the researchers deem an ""average American diet,"" which was made up of 34% of calories from fat, 16% from protein, while around half of calories were from carbohydrates.  From both of the moderate-fat diets, participants gained 34% of calories from fat, of which 17% were from monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). The lower-fat diet provided participants with 24% of calories from fat, of which 11% was from MUFAs.  Moderate-fat diet with one avocado a day lowered 'bad' cholesterol by 13.5 mg/dL  The researchers found that participants' levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) - referred to as the ""bad"" cholesterol - were an average of 8.3 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) lower after following the lower-fat diet without an avocado and 7.4 mg/dL lower after following the moderate-fat diet without an avocado, compared with their baseline average.  However, after participants followed the moderate-fat diet with one avocado a day, their LDL levels were found to be an average of 13.5 mg/dL lower than their baseline average.  What is more, the team found that a number of additional blood measurements - such as total cholesterol, small dense LDL, triglycerides and non-HDL (high-density lipoprotein) - were better after participants followed the moderate-fat diet with one avocado a day, compared with the other two diets.  Although these findings demonstrate that an avocado a day alongside a moderate-fat diet has the potential to reduce bad cholesterol, the team notes that their research was a controlled feeding study. ""That is not the real-world,"" says Kris-Etherton, ""so it is a proof-of-concept investigation.""  Still, the team believes their findings indicate that people should consider replacing saturated fatty acids in their diet with healthier fats from avocados and other sources. Kris-Etherton adds:  ""We need to focus on getting people to eat a heart-healthy diet that includes avocados and other nutrient-rich food sources of better fats. In the United States avocados are not a mainstream food yet, and they can be expensive, especially at certain times of the year. Also, most people do not really know how to incorporate them in their diet except for making guacamole. But guacamole is typically eaten with corn chips, which are high in calories and sodium. Avocados, however, can also be eaten with salads, vegetables, sandwiches, lean protein foods (like chicken or fish) or even whole.""  It should be noted that this research was supported by the Hass Avocado Board, but the researchers say the organization played no other role in the study.  In January 2014, Medical News Today reported on a study suggesting that consuming half an avocado with lunch each day may satisfy hunger in overweight individuals and help with weight management.  Our Knowledge Center article on the health benefits of avocado reveals some of the other ways the food may be good for us, as well as the potential risks of avocado consumption."	0
CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. researchers are closing in on an accurate test for autism, a finding that could lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment.  An autistic child peers from between curtains at the Consulting Centre for Autism in Amman, March 30, 2010. REUTERS/Ali Jarekji  The test, which uses conventional magnetic resonance imaging or MRI machines, detected 94 percent of individuals with a high-functioning form of autism, they reported on Thursday.  “These results are the best yet in the search for a biological basis in terms of being able to distinguish those with and without the disease,” said Nicholas Lange of Harvard Medical School, who directs the Neurostatistics Laboratory at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts.  He said the findings, published in the journal Autism Research, were very preliminary, but if confirmed in several more and larger studies, they might replace current subjective tests now used to diagnose the disorder.  And, he said, they might also lead to better management and treatment of people with autism, a complex and mysterious brain disorder usually first diagnosed in early childhood.  Autism is characterized by difficulties in social interaction, communication, and understanding other people’s emotions and behavior.  For the study, researchers at McLean and a team led by Dr. Janet Lainhart the University of Utah used an MRI that was tuned to pick up microscopic features of the brain’s wiring — a technique known as diffusion tensor imaging.  “You don’t need any fancy equipment. This is performed around the world,” Lange said in a telephone interview.  The team did scans of this type on the brains of 30 people with autism and 30 people without.  They found that the brain circuitry is significantly different in those with autism compared to people with normal brain function, specifically in areas of the brain that are engaged in language and social and emotional functioning.  By measuring six aspects of the brain’s circuitry, the test was able to correctly pick out people who had been diagnosed with autism with 94 percent accuracy.  A repeat study using two different sets of subjects showed the same high level of performance.  Lange said the findings should help make the process of diagnosing autism more scientific because it would rely on a test rather than a subjective assessment.  And it may also offer an early diagnosis, which could help affected children get earlier intervention, when it is most likely to do some good.  “The basis of autism in the brain is very deep. There may be very little that one can actually change about the disorder for an individual with a severe case,” Lange said.  “However, it has been shown that in the early stages of development, individuals have been aided by intense one-on-one caring to help them with language, social function with their peers and also with emotional problems,” he said.  Autism disorders are diagnosed in one in 110 children in the United States and affect four times as many boys as girls.	1
"The breast cancer drug tamoxifen may stall the progression of Cancer Institute lung cancer site” href=""url target=""_blank"">non-small cell lung cancer in those who take it after breast cancer treatment, a new study has found.  Tamoxifen is the oldest of a wide array of medications that block the action of the hormone estrogen in the body. Researchers have found Women’s Health Initiative study” href=""url target=""_blank"">growing evidence in recent years that the majority of non-small cell lung cancers -- the most common form of lung cancer -- respond to estrogen with growth. So they wondered whether women taking tamoxifen as an adjunct to their breast cancer treatment might be less likely to develop or die of lung cancer.  Drawing from a meticulously maintained Swiss registry of cancer patients, researchers followed 6,665 breast cancer patients in the Swiss canton of Geneva, 3,066 of whom took tamoxifen following breast cancer treatment. The researchers found that the tamoxifen group was very slightly less likely to develop lung cancer than breast cancer survivors who did not take the drug. But the difference was so small that they concluded it could have been a statistical fluke.  But deaths from lung cancer were distinctly more numerous among the women who had not taken tamoxifen than among those who had -- a difference significant enough for researchers to declare that by shutting off one source of fuel to an incipient lung tumor, tamoxifen may slow progression of the disease once it has taken hold in a woman’s lung.  Advertisement  Researchers writing in the journal Cancer suggested that newer estrogen blockers on the market, including the osteoporosis drug raloxifene and a class of drugs called aromatase inhibitors, may also be able to slow the progression of lung cancer.  Estrogen blockers such tamoxifen and the aromatase inhibitors have significant side effects and are generally used only for women past menopause. So they’re unlikely to become drugs for the prevention of lung cancer, as they currently are for breast cancer. But as researchers learn more about lung cancer and study whether early detection of this deadly cancer can save lives, the role of estrogen in helping those cancers take hold and grow will likely get more attention."	1

Cancer experts said Tuesday that the actress and filmmaker Angelina Jolie Pitt was wise to have had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed last week because she carries a genetic mutation, BRCA1, that significantly increases the risk of ovarian cancer, a disease so difficult to detect that it is often found only at an advanced, untreatable stage.  They also said Ms. Jolie Pitt’s decision to discuss her own choices so frankly will encourage women in similar situations to consider their own options. BRCA mutations cause about 5 to 10 percent of breast cancers and 10 to 15 percent of ovarian cancers among white women in the United States. It is unclear how common the mutations are in other racial and ethnic groups.  “Prophylactic removal of ovaries and fallopian tubes is strongly recommended in women before age 40 in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers,” said Dr. Susan Domchek, executive director of the University of Pennsylvania’s Basser Research Center, which specializes in BRCA mutations. “There is no effective screening for ovarian cancer and too many women with advanced stage ovarian cancer die of their disease.”  Writing for The New York Times’s Op-Ed page, Ms. Jolie Pitt, 39, said she had expected to have her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed, a procedure called a laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, but that a cancer scare made her decide to undergo the procedure sooner. Her mother, aunt and grandmother died of cancer.	0

"Varicose veins are one of the more unsightly signs of aging. But new, less-invasive treatments are making it easier to remove them painlessly, bypassing a difficult surgical procedure that was often the only option in the past.  As many as 25% of women and 15% of men suffer from varicose veins; over the age of 50, one out of two people are affected. Heredity plays a part, but obesity, prolonged standing on the job and hormone therapy increase the risks. Sometimes, varicose veins have no signs or symptoms and require no treatment, though doctors may recommend wearing compression stockings and elevating the legs. Exercise can also help relieve pain. But often, varicose veins can be disabling and dangerous, as well as a warning sign of more serious problems in the circulatory system.  While vein problems aren't related to artery problems—such as those that can cause heart disease—serious complications of varicose veins can include deep vein thrombosis, a blood clot that can travel to the lungs and cause death, and venous ulcers, shallow wounds that develop on the lower leg and can be hard to heal. Veins near the surface of the skin can also rupture and bleed heavily.  Valve Trouble  Normally, the heart pumps blood filled with nutrients and oxygen to the entire body through the arteries, and then veins carry the blood from the body back up to the heart. The exact cause of varicose veins isn't known, but they develop when one-way valves in the veins that prevent blood from flowing backward stop working properly, so blood pools in the superficial veins under the surface of the skin and causes them to get larger and less elastic.  Darren Schneider, director of the Center for Vascular and Endovascular Surgery at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center, says determining the right treatment depends in large part on the size and location of the veins. Patients typically need an ultrasound study to see if there are any blood clots in the deeper vein system, and to assess the function of the valves.  Smaller veins can often be treated with sclerotherapy, which involves injecting a chemical solution into the vein to destroy it, and costs $250 to $500 per treatment. For larger veins, doctors may recommend endovascular procedures, which range in price from $2,500 to $3,000. These involve threading a catheter into the vein and directing a heat source such as a laser or radio-frequency device into the vein to incinerate it.  Vein procedures are offered by a range of physicians, including vascular surgeons, dermatologists and cardiologists. Dr. Schneider, trained as both a vascular surgeon and an interventional radiologist, suggests that patients ask if a doctor is board-certified in a vascular specialty, or what specialized training the doctor has received in vein therapy.  The Old Way  In a procedure that dates to the 19th century, varicose veins can be removed by stripping—pulling them out with a wire threaded in through an incision. The surgery can cause bleeding, bruising, nerve injuries, scarring and infection, and legs may have to be wrapped with bandages for several weeks.  While some veins may still require stripping surgery, most can be treated with less invasive therapies. Last summer, the Food and Drug Administration approved an injectable drug for sclerotherapy that has been widely used in Europe for years, polidocanol—sold under the brand name Asclera—for use in the tiniest varicose veins, known as spider veins, and for so-called reticular veins that are one to three millimeters in diameter.  The drug has a strong safety record, and it also has anesthetic properties, which makes treatments more comfortable for patients, according to Suman Rathbun, director of the vascular medicine program at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center in Oklahoma City. Although Asclera isn't approved to treat large veins, Dr. Rathbun and others are using it off-label for that purpose, converting the liquid into a foam. When injected, Dr., Rathbun says, it fills the vein better than the liquid, which sometimes leaks out, making it less effective.  Laser Procedures  Studies have shown that minimally invasive endovenous laser procedures that use local anesthesia are highly effective for removing the so-called saphenous veins—a large one that runs from the foot to the thigh and a smaller one up the back of the leg behind the knee—and have a high rate of success over time.  Nancy Neukam, 67, says she decided to try the procedure because the bulging blue varicose veins in her lower left leg were increasingly unsightly and painful. Though she feared treatment would be painful and difficult, Ms. Neukam took half a Valium and slept, feeling nothing as Baltimore dermatologist Robert Weiss guided a catheter and laser tip into the vein to seal it closed in 40 minutes.  Ms. Neukam had to wear compression stockings for three days afterward and had some bruising, but now, she says, ""I play golf and don't mind wearing "	0
Toby Maudsley/Getty Images  A study published late last month in The New England Journal of Medicine is raising provocative questions about how best to treat a torn anterior cruciate ligament. For the study, researchers from Lund University in Sweden recruited 121 young adults who had injured their A.C.L.’s. The volunteers, between 18 and 35, were physically active, and many were competitive athletes. They agreed, rather bravely, to be randomly assigned to one of two groups and accept radically different treatments for their torn A.C.L.’s. The first group began physical therapy and then underwent surgical reconstruction of the ligament, considered by many people to be the best option for injured athletes. The second group received only physical therapy, with the option to have the operation later. Twenty-three subjects of that group did eventually have the operation. (For those fortunate enough not to be personally familiar with A.C.L. surgery, reconstruction involves replacing the injured ligament with tissue from elsewhere in your own leg or from a cadaver.)  Over two years, the injured knees were assessed using a comprehensive numerical score that rated pain, function during activity and other measures. At the time of the original injury, the knee also had been scored. At the end of the two years, both groups showed considerable improvement. The scores for the surgically repaired knees had risen by 39.2 points. The scores for the more conservatively treated knees also had risen, by 39.4 points. In other words, the outcomes were virtually identical. Despite a widespread belief that surgery leads to a stronger knee, the results showed that surgically reconstructing the A.C.L. as soon as possible after the tear “was not superior” to more conservative treatment, the study’s authors wrote. The findings suggest, the authors concluded, that “more than half the A.C.L. reconstructions” currently being conducted on injured knees “could be avoided without adversely affecting outcomes.”  This possibility should reverberate across playing fields nationwide, where, at the moment, preseason high school, collegiate and adult-league sports practices are under way, with a concomitant surge in A.C.L. tears. By one estimate, as many as 1 in every 556 fit, active people will tear an A.C.L. — particularly if they participate in sports that involve frequent pivoting and landing, like soccer, football, tennis, skiing and basketball. At the same time, the urge to treat the injury with surgery appears to be growing. The “belief among most surgeons and patients is that surgery is a ‘must,’ at least if you aim to go back into an active lifestyle,” the Swedish authors of the study e-mailed in response to questions.  Part of the reason for A.C.L. surgery’s popularity is that by most measures, it works. In the current study, most of the group members who had reconstructive surgery reported that their injured knees felt healthy after two years and that they had returned to activity — not, in most cases, at the same level as before their injuries, but they were active. Significantly, their knees also were notably more “stable” than the joints that hadn’t been surgically fixed. Stability is, in theory, desirable. A stable knee rarely gives way.  But in practice, the importance of stability after A.C.L. treatment is “controversial,” The New England Journal study’s authors, Richard Frobell, Ph.D., and Stefan Lohmander, M.D., Ph.D., of Lund University, wrote in their e-mail. In an important 2009 study published in The British Journal of Sports Medicine, researchers retrospectively compared outcomes after 10 years in competitive athletes who had surgery or had opted for conservative treatment of their torn A.C.L.’s. The surgically repaired knees were notably more stable. But they weren’t fundamentally healthier. The surgically reconstructed knees and the conservatively treated joints experienced similar (and high) levels of early onset knee arthritis, a common occurrence after an A.C.L. tear. The treatments were almost identical, too, in terms of whether the athletes could return to sports and whether they reported subsequent knee problems.  Why, then, undergo A.C.L. reconstruction, an operation that can be expensive and, like all surgical procedures, carries risks? Several top-flight orthopedic surgeons I contacted say that they remain convinced that surgery leads to a better long-term outcome for certain patients, particularly if they want to return to pivoting sports. “The reason to have the surgery is to preserve” other parts of the knee from injury during activity, says Dr. Warren Dunn, an assistant professor of orthopedics and rehabilitation at Vanderbilt University who has extensively studied A.C.L. tears. He points out that in The New England Journal of Medicine study, only 8 percent of the patients in the first surgical group subsequently tore a meniscus, a fragile pillow of cartilage that can rip if a knee gives way.

"En Español  By Amanda Gardner  HealthDay Reporter  WEDNESDAY, Nov. 17, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental drug that raises HDL, or ""good,"" cholesterol seems to have passed an initial hurdle by proving safe in preliminary trials.  Although the trial was primarily designed to look at safety, researchers scheduled to present the finding Wednesday at the American Heart Association's annual meeting in Chicago also report that anacetrapib raised HDL cholesterol by 138 percent and cut LDL, HDL's evil twin, almost in half.  ""We saw very encouraging reductions in clinical events,"" said Dr. Christopher Cannon, lead author of the study, which also appears in the Nov. 18 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.  A big study to confirm the results would take four to five years to complete so the drug is still years away from market, said Cannon, who is a cardiologist with Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.  Other experts are intrigued by the findings, but note that the research is still in very early stages.  ""There are a lot of people in the prevention/lipid field that are simultaneously excited and leery,"" said Dr. Howard Weintraub, clinical director of the Center for the Prevention of Cardiovascular Disease at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City.  Added Dr. John C. LaRosa, president of the State University of New York (SUNY) Downstate Medical Center in New York City: ""It's very preliminary but it's important because the last drug out of the barrel of this type was not a success. This looks like a better drug, but it's not definitive by any means. Don't take this to the bank.""  LaRosa was referring to torcetrapib, which, like anacetrapib, belongs to the class of drugs known as cholesterol ester transfer protein (CETP) inhibitors.  A large trial on torcetrapib was killed after investigators found an increased risk of death and other cardiovascular outcomes.  ""I would be more excited [about anacetrapib] if I hadn't seen what happened to its cousin torcetrapib,"" Weintraub said. ""Torcetrapib raised HDL astoundingly but that was entirely neutralized by the increase in cardiovascular events.""  In the new trial, anacetrapib actually showed a tendency toward fewer cardiovascular problems and fewer angioplasty or bypass procedures, although the study only lasted 18 months.  It also didn't result in the blood pressure increases that helped doom torcetrapib.  To assess the safety of the trial, investigators randomly chose 1,623 adults with coronary heart disease who were taking cholesterol-lowering statins to receive either anacetrapib or a placebo for 18 months.  At the end of six months, LDL cholesterol was cut 81 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dl) of blood to 45 mg/dl, a reduction of about 40 percent. In the placebo group, LDL levels only declined from 82 mg/dl to 77 mg/dl.  Meanwhile, HDL levels increased from 41 mg/dl of blood to 101 mg/dl in the treatment arm, versus a small jump from 40 mg/dl to 46 mg/dl in the placebo group.  ""We have 94 percent confidence that this drug doesn't have the harmful effect that torcetrapib had, but we didn't prove a reduction in events,"" said Brigham and Women's Cannon. ""That will be the subject of a larger study.""  Such a study is in the works, he added.  Dr. Neil Coplan, director of clinical cardiology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, stressed that this was a ""safety trial, not a trial which is saying in any way that people should take these medications nor are the drugs approved.""  Still, he added, ""the trial demonstrated safety and it demonstrated a tremendous effect on altering the lipid profile in a good direction. It's very promising but, as the authors note themselves, it's a first step.""  Experts are still divided as to whether raising HDL levels will actually result in any meaningful improvements in clinical outcomes.  ""Currently, we're not convinced that manipulation of HDL matters, though certainly it's promising,"" said Weintraub, who added that results should be available relatively soon from other trials exploring the issue. ""The fact that LDL was also reduced also makes it promising.""  ""We've never been able to satisfactorily demonstrate that raising HDL actually changes risk,"" added LaRosa.  The only drug currently available to raise HDL is nyacin.  More information  The American Heart Association has more on understanding your cholesterol levels."	0
In studies conducted for F.D.A. approval, the most commonly reported side effects were bruising, pain and swelling. Dr. Derek H. Jones, a dermatologist and a principal investigator in a trial of the drug’s effectiveness, found that people with the most fat had the most swelling. It usually cleared up in 48 to 72 hours.  “That makes sense, because you’re destroying more fat cells,” said Dr. Jones, a paid consultant who will teach injectors and who treated Ms. Gallagher. In his experience, the first treatment is the most painful.  The injections will be commercially available in late summer, after doctors are trained to give them. The price for Kybella is not yet set.  Not every patient is a good candidate for this treatment, several experts said. If a patient has excess fat and loose skin, Dr. Rohrich said, “you’ll have a crepey neck and need a neck lift” after fat is reduced with the shot. Neck lifts can cost $5,000 or more.  Image Ms. Gallagher before the injections to slim down her double chin.  The drug does not target only fat cells. It will also destroy skin cells if inadvertently injected into the skin, the F.D.A. has warned.  “If you inject into the dermis, you can hurt the skin,” Dr. Rohrich said. “This drug needs to go into fat tissue to work.” Misdirected injections could even harden skin, he said.	0
"A growing number of doctors are offering an expensive laser procedure they say zaps away a common fungus that causes ugly, discolored nails. Published data on laser treatment for nail fungus is scant, but early results suggest it is a reasonable option for people who don't want the side effects of oral medications.  Onychomycosis, or fungal infection of nails—most often on the toes—affects about 12% of Americans, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. Some people are genetically prone to it. Others, including swimmers and other athletes, may be more likely to get it because they go barefoot in public areas or because their feet are often damp, scientists say. In its mild forms, nail fungus is merely a cosmetic problem, but over time it can cause toenails to grow abnormally and become painful when walking.  Toenail laser treatment offers a new alternative to oral medication, which carries a risk of liver damage, and a nail lacquer, which has poor efficacy.  The cost of zapping nail fungus with a laser can range $750 to $1,500 for a treatment course. It isn't generally covered by insurance. Whether you choose oral medications or lasers, it can easily take a year for nails to clear entirely.  So far only one company's laser has received Food and Drug Administration clearance, which is a streamlined review process for medical devices, for toenail fungus: PinPointe USA Inc., of Chico, Calif., received clearance in October to market its laser for ""the temporary increase of clear nail"" in patients, according to the FDA clearance letter. Two companies, Nomir Medical Technologies Inc. of Brooklyn, N.Y., which first applied in 2009, and CoolTouch Inc., of Roseville, Calif., have applied for FDA clearance for the nail-fungus purpose and are waiting for an FDA decision.  Several other lasers, cleared by the FDA for other purposes, are being used ""off label"" by doctors to treat toenail fungus.  Solid evidence of the lasers' effectiveness, is scant. In clinical practice, results have varied, according to doctors who have used the laser. New Jersey podiatrist Anas Khoury, who has no affiliation with any laser company, says he has been using Nomir's Noveon laser for toenails for about four months and says it works in about 80% of his patients. ""My patients and I are very happy with it,"" he adds.  Philadelphia podiatrist Warren Joseph, who is a consultant for Nomir and a former consultant for PinPointe, says: ""I think it is a really interesting, viable alternative but I want to see published data."" His advice to patients: ""Ask for the evidence—and not just before-and-after pictures.""  Treatments typically take 30 to 45 minutes for up to 10 toes. Depending on the severity of the problem and the laser used, patients may need one to four treatments.  How the lasers work varies and how they affect toenail fungus isn't fully understood in all cases. Nomir says its lab research shows its laser kills fungus. CoolTouch says it believes its laser inhibits fungal growth, paving the way for the body's own defenses to clear the nail.  So far only Nomir has published evidence of efficacy, but its study is small and short term. A company-funded study of 34 patients and 26 treated toes published last year in the Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association found that after four laser treatments, 85% of the nails showed new growth without fungus. Of the total, 65% showed at least three millimeters of clear new nail and 26% had at least four millimeters. The study took its final measures six months after treatment, but hasn't yet published the data.  PinPointe supplied The Wall Street Journal a summary of unpublished data from a study looking at 265 patients over two years. In the summary, 71.4% of the patients experienced continuous improvement over a year after a single session with its laser.  If you are willing to risk side effects, the best tested—and likely most effective—treatment for toenail fungus remains oral medications such as Novartis AG's Lamisil, says Bryan C. Markinson, chief of podiatric medicine at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. Dr. Markinson has been a paid adviser to Novartis and owns stock in Nomir and serves on its medical-advisory board.  According to Lamisil's FDA-approved prescribing information, 3.3% of patients in clinical trials had abnormal levels of liver enzymes, a possible warning sign of liver damage, compared with 1.4% of people taking a placebo. In rare cases, people have needed liver transplants or died from liver failure after taking Lamisil.  To prevent fungus recurrence, you must follow a scrupulous hygiene program, including anti-fungal spray for feet and shoes, not going barefoot, keeping feet clean and dry and changing socks daily, doctors say.  ""Patients and some doctors have this expectation that because it's a laser treatment, once you zap it and its gone forever,"" says Dr. Markinson. ""That totally ignores the fact that this is an infectious disease and that recur"	0
March 30, 2011 -- Two highly anticipated hepatitis C drugs are poised to usher in a new era in the treatment of the viral disease as early as this summer, experts say.  The Merck drug boceprevir and Vertex Pharmaceutical’s similar drug telaprevir are expected to win FDA approval within months, following phase III trials showing that both drugs boosted cure rates to around 70% when used with standard therapy.  The drugs will be used in patients with HCV genotype 1 -- the hardest to treat form of the viral infection.  Adding one of the drugs to the current two-drug regimen of peginterferon and ribavirin will make the treatment of hepatitis C more complex, but it will also cure a lot more people, hepatitis C specialist Donald M. Jensen, MD, of the University of Chicago Medical Center, tells WebMD.  “Triple-drug therapy represents a major advance in the treatment of hepatitis C for patients,” he says.  Results from two phase III boceprevir trials are published in the New England Journal of Medicine.	0
WASHINGTON—People with mild Alzheimer’s disease who started taking an experimental Eli Lilly LLY -0.70% & Co. drug earlier in the course of their disease fared better than patients who started later in a clinical trial.  The outcome may bolster the company’s case that the drug, solanezumab, can slow the decline of memory and function in mild Alzheimer’s patients, despite prior studies with negative results. But the new data aren’t final proof of the drug’s benefit—a separate, continuing study due to end in late 2016 is designed to more definitively test its efficacy and safety.  In other studies, Biogen Inc. BIIB -0.13% announced some new data suggesting that its experimental Alzheimer’s drug slowed the progression of the disease, while researchers said a clinical trial of a Roche Holding AG compound indicated the therapy reduced the volume of a substance in the brains of patients that is believed to contribute to the disease.  Results of these studies were presented Wednesday at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Washington. The data are largely incremental but were still being watched keenly by investors, who are looking for signals of potential success after years of failed drug candidates in the Alzheimer’s space.  The drug-industry trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association, recently released a report calculating that 123 experimental therapies for Alzheimer’s failed between 1998 and 2014 while only four drugs made it to market.  Lilly hopes solanezumab becomes the first marketed treatment to slow the worsening of the underlying disease. Current treatments for Alzheimer’s can alleviate symptoms but don’t slow underlying disease progression.  Jefferies & Co. analyst Jeffrey Holford estimates the Lilly drug could generate peak annual sales of more than $3 billion world-wide if it is approved for marketing by regulators. A leading theory in Alzheimer’s research is that the buildup of a sticky protein known as beta amyloid in the brain contributes to the disease. Lilly’s solanezumab is designed to bind to amyloid and clear it from the brain.  But the amyloid hypothesis hasn’t been proven in clinical trials. In two large clinical trials reported in 2012, solanezumab failed to significantly slow the decline of cognition and functional abilities among the overall population of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s, compared with a placebo. Other companies’ drugs targeting amyloid also have failed in trials.  Lilly scientists, however, said the drug appeared to slow cognitive decline in a subgroup: patients with a mild form of the disease. The company has continued developing the drug in mild Alzheimer’s patients.  Since 2012, Lilly has continued to provide the drug to patients who received it in the earlier trials, and patients who originally received a placebo in those studies were allowed to switch over to solanezumab. On average, the placebo patients started solanezumab 18 months after the earlier patients.  The new results showed that the patients who started therapy earlier retained an advantage in cognition and daily function over those who started later, and that this difference persisted for two years.  Researchers said such a finding is consistent with the hypothesis that solanezumab is modifying the underlying disease. Some patients receiving solanezumab experienced swelling in the brain and other adverse events, but researchers said the drug was generally well tolerated.  “Here we have a safe antibody treatment, solanezumab, that appears to benefit mild Alzheimer’s disease dementia subjects,” said Paul Aisen, director of the Alzheimer’s Therapeutic Research Institute at the University of Southern California, who presented the results.  Eric Siemers, an Alzheimer’s researcher at Lilly, said the new clinical data increases his confidence in solanezumab but “we’ll find out if it works or not” when a separate, continuing study of the drug is completed by the end of 2016.  In March, Biogen, of Cambridge, Mass., announced some results from an early-stage clinical trial that showed its drug, aducanumab, given to a very small group of participants with mild memory problems appeared to reduce the amount of amyloid in the brain. The treatment also appeared to slow down cognitive decline—particularly at the highest dose of 10 mg/kg—in these people.  The results impressed Wall Street and lifted the company’s stock to all-time highs. RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee estimates annual sales of the Biogen drug could top $10 billion if it reaches the market. The March findings, however, didn’t include all doses of medication at the 12-month time point.  Aducanumab is an antibody that is thought to bind to sticky clumps of the protein amyloid in the brain and causes cells to digest away the plaque and reduce amyloid, said Alfred Sandrock, Biogen’s chief medical officer.  On Wednesday, researchers presented Biogen’s full one-year data of all four medication	0

Linda Bardwell is holding her ... more Photo: Eric Kayne, For The Chronicle Photo: Eric Kayne, For The Chronicle Image 1 of / 3 Caption Close Houston surgeons treat heart through spinal cord 1 / 3 Back to Gallery  In a possible new way to treat heart failure, Houston surgeons implanted a device and wire in a Pearland man Monday that will electrically stimulate portions of his spinal cord.  The method, commonly used to treat pain, activates nerves that Methodist Hospital doctors think will improve the heart's ability to pump effectively, lowering blood pressure, reducing the amount of irregular heartbeats and stopping stress hormones from overreacting and causing cardiac damage.  ""Despite the development of drugs that treat heart failure, patients continue to deteriorate,"" said Dr. Guillermo Torre-Amione, a Methodist heart failure specialist and leader of the effort. ""This is a new concept that could increase therapeutic efficacy without adding new medications.""  Hollis Bardwell, 61, sounded excited about the possibility Monday evening, five hours after surgeons finished putting the pacemaker-like device in the side of his lower back and threading an attached 35-inch wire up his spine. He said he hopes the therapy will give him greater mobility while he waits for a heart transplant.  ""I'm looking forward to rocking and rolling again,"" said Bardwell.  Doctors said Bardwell was doing well Monday evening and should be able to leave the hospital tonight.  Bardwell hasn't worked since November because his condition, inherited, makes breathing so difficult. He was hospitalized 14 times in 2009, always to have fluid drained from his lungs so he could breathe. He went on the heart transplant waiting list two months ago.  Monday's implantation marked the beginning of Torre's Phase 1 clinical trial of the therapy, the first time what is known as neurostimulation has been used to treat heart failure.  There is considerable data showing connections between the brain, nervous system and heart, said Torre, but until now, no one has attempted to take advantage of the relationship therapeutically.  Prognosis is grave  If the experiment proves successful, it would provide an entirely different approach to heart failure, a chronic, progressive disease that affects nearly 6 million Americans.  Characterized by the heart's inability to supply sufficient blood flow to meet the body's needs, heart failure can lead to shortness of breath, fluid and retention, lung congestion and rapid or irregular heartbeats. It is usually ultimately fatal.  The condition is currently treated by oral medications, almost all of which lower blood pressure. A typical heart failure patient is on seven such drugs, which Torre characterized as ""the limit."" Because new drugs can only be tested on top of existing therapy, introducing potentially better drugs is difficult.  Neurostimulation works by sending low-intensity electrical impulses to targeted portions of the spinal cord.  The hope is that such stimulation will modulate nervous system responses, such as toning down the release of hormones that typically occur at times of stress and increasing the flow of blood.  20-patient study  The study calls for Torre to implant the system, done through small puncture holes in the lower back, in 20 patients with advanced heart failure, then conducting tests on them after one, two and three months to measure heart function.  Torre said though patients may feel some euphoria in the early days, it likely will take about a month before doctors have a good idea whether the therapy is working.  The therapy passed a first test Monday evening as doctors adjusted the electrical impulse level to Bardwell's satisfaction.  ""It's really mild,"" said Bardwell. ""The most I feel is a tingle like when your hand is going to sleep on you. When it's set low, I don't feel anything at all.""  todd.ackerman@chron.com"	1
"(CNN) How much -- or how little -- you eat could influence how long you live.  The idea of caloric control improving your health, and therefore your lifespan, is nothing new, but researchers are now hoping to accurately determine the type of diet that could make you live longer.  One team at the University of Southern California ( USC) are reducing the calorie count as low as it can go, using specific foods to trick the human body into thinking it's fasting -- a process called fasting mimicry.  ""Diet can have a remarkable effect on you,"" says Valter Longo, Professor of Gerontology at USC Davis, who has been long been researching the mechanisms behind human aging and has recently turned his attention to fasting.  ""It can reprogram your body and put it on a path to live longer,"" says Longo.  Shutdown and regeneration  Fasting has been performed by communities and cultures for millennia and Longo's team are curious about the advantages.  Their idea follows on from the long running trend of caloric restriction, mostly known through diets such as the 5-2 diet and intermittent fasting. Longo tested the impact of fasting for five consecutive days every month, believing that when the body thinks it's in a state of fasting, it shuts down and goes into standby mode.  ""As cells are killed and the body goes into standby, your stem cells switch on,"" says Longo. Once switched on, the stem cells can regenerate the lost cells and organ mass -- leaving you shiny and new.  When cells in the body age, their ratios change and Longo believes the body's reaction -- and repair methods -- to fasting help restore them to when you were younger. ""You're killing the bad cells and regenerating with cells that are more functional.""  Starvation strategies  In a 2015 study , Longo's team set a specific diet for human volunteers, which mimicked the effects of fasting over five consecutive days monthly, for three months. Trials were also conducted in mice.  People consumed approximately 1000 calories on day one and 725 calories for the remaining four days, but these numbers alone didn't determine the benefit.  ""It's not just about reducing calories"", says Longo. His diet is designed to include specific percentages of protein, fat and carbohydrates, for maximum effect. The food items used, however, were specific to the trial and if translated to the public would involve designing meals made up of the right combination of nutrients.  ""The human fasting mimicking diet (FMD) program is a plant based diet program designed to attain fasting-like effects while providing micronutrient nourishment (vitamins, minerals, etc.) and minimize the burden of fasting,"" Longo said in the study  After three months, the benefits were a reduction in body weight as well as certain risk factors for cardiovascular disease. There was also an increase in certain stem cells in the body.  ""The diet is turning on the body's ability to renew itself,"" says Longo.  The team have since calculated that following the diet every three months could provide enough of an impact as effects are thought to last up to six months.  How does it work?  ""When you fast, you lower protein and certain amino acids and you control pathways [in the body],"" says Longo. The pathways he refers to are known as TOR, PKA and IGF pathways, which when controlled can switch on certain reactions inside the body causing immune cells to die and organs to shrink.  This activation, or reduction, of pathways is why the components of the diet, such a proteins, must also be controlled. ""You won't activate the correct pathways,"" says Longo.  ""When you make IGF less active, it reduces risk factors linked to diabetes and cardiovascular disease,"" says Miguel Toribio-Mateas, Chairman of the British Association for Applied Nutrition and Nutritional Therapy.  According to Toribio-Mateas, the results confirm earlier theories that ""some hormone-like growth factors that are required during development to grow, then become promoting agents of aging after development and sexual maturity have been reached"". He also believes the benefits are down to improved efficiency on a cellular level.  ""Cells have a list of things to do every day,...like getting rid of toxins"" says Toribio-Mateas. If their workload is then disrupted by the need to store excess calories, certain products can accumulate. ""Regulating calories can have a very positive effect,"" he says. To him, diet underpins longevity.  Is it safe?  Unlike the 5-2 diet, which requires two days of low calories at any point in the week, Longo's diet involves fasting for five consecutive days, which requires much more willpower.  ""Five days is safe: going on for longer is difficult to do outside of a clinic,"" says Longo.  More work needs to be done to fine tune the diet and determine meals that meet the criteria. Longo has since founded his own nutrition company. L-Nutra, to sell products that serve this purpose, which may be seen as a conflict of interest. He states that pro"	0
"En Español  By Steven Reinberg  HealthDay Reporter  MONDAY, Feb. 15, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Acupuncture may help ease pain and improve quality of life for people with fibromyalgia, a new study suggests.  Ten weeks after treatment, the pain scores of patients given acupuncture dropped an average of 41 percent, compared with an average drop of 27 percent for those given a simulated acupuncture treatment. The benefits were still seen after a year.  ""Individualized acupuncture is a safe and good therapeutic option for the treatment of patients with fibromyalgia,"" said lead researcher Dr. Jorge Vas, of the pain treatment unit at Dona Mercedes Primary Health Center in Seville, Spain.  Fibromyalgia patients have chronic widespread pain, which is associated with fatigue, poor sleep patterns and depression. The condition affects up to 5 percent of the population, Vas said. Between 80 percent and 90 percent of fibromyalgia patients are women.  According to the study authors, nine out of 10 patients try some form of alternative therapy, such as massage or acupuncture, in addition to their regular pain medication.  ""Both acupuncture and traditional medicine have a place in treating fibromyalgia,"" said Dr. Alexander Rances, an acupuncturist, pain management specialist and attending physician at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y.  ""A combination of Western as well as traditional Chinese medicine probably offers these patients the best possible therapy,"" he said.  With acupuncture, extremely thin needles are inserted through the skin at strategic body points to treat pain.  Fibromyalgia treatment usually starts with medications such as the nerve pain medication Lyrica (pregabalin), and if that fails or is only partly effective, doctors might add acupuncture to the mix, Rances said.  For the study, Vas and colleagues randomly assigned 153 patients diagnosed with fibromyalgia to individually tailored acupuncture or simulated acupuncture. Patients had nine weekly treatments, each session lasting 20 minutes.  ""Although it was allowed for the participants to continue with the pharmacological [drug] treatment they were taking beforehand, when the study was finished, the patients who received individualized acupuncture were taking less medication than the group on sham acupuncture,"" Vas said.  At 10 weeks, six months and 12 months after treatment, patients were asked about perceived levels of pain and depression and their physical and mental quality of life.  One year after treatment, acupuncture patients had an average 20 percent drop in their pain score, compared with a little more than 6 percent among those who had simulated therapy, the researchers found.  Scores on the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire, which measures how the condition affects patients' lives, also differed between groups. Reductions were seen of 35 percent at 10 weeks, and just over 22 percent at one year, for those given real acupuncture, compared with 24.5 percent and 5 percent, respectively, for those given sham acupuncture, the researchers said.  In addition, pressure pain and the number of tender points also improved more in patients given real acupuncture after 10 weeks, as did measures of fatigue, anxiety and depression, Vas said.  However, although taking less pain medication, acupuncture patients were using higher levels of antidepressants after one year, which may have artificially boosted the positive results, he said.  The report was published online Feb. 15 in the journal Acupuncture in Medicine.  Dr. Allyson Shrikhande is a physiatrist -- a doctor who specializes in physical medicine and rehabilitation -- at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. She agreed that antidepressant use could have been a ""significant contributing factor to their continued improvement.""  Still, Shrikhande said, ""the findings in this study help demonstrate that acupuncture is a safe and effective treatment for chronic pain patients.""  Many patients with fibromyalgia have a central nervous system that is unregulated, meaning an abundance of pain signals are sent to the brain, Shrikhande said.  ""Acupuncture can calm or quiet the nervous system and help slow down the pain signals to the brain. Acupuncture can also improve blood flow, which can improve oxygenation of tissues,"" she said.  Some insurance companies cover acupuncture, which costs about $125 a session, according to the University of California, San Diego Center for Integrative Medicine.

Jonathan Lubecky, a Marine Corps and Army veteran, returned from a deployment to Iraq with severe PTSD. His participation in a study of MDMA, the drug commonly known as ecstasy, proved life-saving. (Travis Dove/For The Washington Post)  For Jon Lubecky, the scars on his wrists are a reminder of the years he spent in mental purgatory.  He returned from an Army deployment in Iraq a broken man. He heard mortar shells and helicopters where there were none. He couldn’t sleep and drank until he passed out. He got every treatment offered by Veterans Affairs for post-traumatic stress disorder. But they didn’t stop him from trying to kill himself — five times.  Finally, he signed up for an experimental therapy and was given a little green capsule. The anguish stopped.  Inside that pill was the compound MDMA, better known by dealers and partygoers as ecstasy. That street drug is emerging as the most promising tool in years for the military’s escalating PTSD epidemic.  The MDMA program was created by a small group of psychedelic researchers who had toiled for years in the face of ridicule, funding shortages and skepticism. But the results have been so positive that this month the Food and Drug Administration deemed it a “breakthrough therapy” — setting it on a fast track for review and potential approval.  A dose of MDMA in the office of South Carolina psychiatrist Michael Mithoefer, who has studied its use as a treatment for PTSD. (Travis Dove/For The Washington Post)  The prospect of a government-sanctioned psychedelic drug has generated both excitement and concern. And it has opened the door to scientists studying new uses for other illegal psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin (commonly known as magic mushrooms).  “We’re in this odd situation where one of the most promising therapies also happens to be a Schedule 1 substance banned by the [Drug Enforcement Administration],” said retired Brig. Gen. Loree Sutton, who until 2010 was the highest-ranking psychiatrist in the U.S. Army.  Because of the stigma attached to psychedelics since the trippy 1960s, many military and government leaders still hesitate to embrace them. Some scientists are also wary of the nonprofit spearheading ecstasy therapy, a group with the stated goal of making the banned drugs part of mainstream culture.  But the scope and severity of PTSD makes it all irrelevant, said Sutton, who now works as New York City’s commissioner of veteran services. “If this is something that could really save lives, we need to run and not walk toward it. We need to follow the data.”  PTSD has been a problem for the military for decades, but America’s recent wars have pushed it to epidemic-level heights. Experts estimate that between 11 and 20 percent of soldiers who served in Iraq or Afghanistan suffer from PTSD.  The affliction is typically triggered after experiencing or witnessing violence, including assault and abuse. It has ravaged lives and broken up marriages. It often leaves its victims in sudden panic and prevents them from dealing with the original trauma.  And that last symptom is what makes PTSD particularly hard to overcome with traditional talk therapy. Because patients can’t talk about and process the trauma, experts say, it lingers like a poison in their mind.  Rick Doblin founded a nonprofit advocating research into the therapeutic use of psychedelic drugs. (Nirvan Mullick)  Only two drugs are approved for treating PTSD: Zoloft and Paxil. Both have proved largely ineffective when it comes to veterans, whose cases are especially difficult to resolve because of their prolonged or repeated exposure to combat.  “If you’re a combat veteran with multiple tours of duty, the chance of a good response to these drugs is 1 in 3, maybe lower,” said John Krystal, chairman of psychiatry at Yale University and a director at the VA’s National Center for PTSD. “That’s why there’s so much frustration and interest in finding something that works better.”  Ecstasy has long been a favorite at trance parties and raves because of its unique ability to flood users with intense feelings of euphoria. But as a byproduct, it also reduces fear and imbues users with a deep sense of love and acceptance of themselves and others — the perfect conditions for trauma therapy.  By giving doses of MDMA at the beginning of three, eight-hour therapy sessions, researchers say they have helped chronic PTSD patients process and move past their traumas.  In clinical trials with 107 patients closely monitored by the FDA, 61 percent reported major reductions in symptoms — to the point where they no longer fit the criteria for PTSD. Follow-up studies a year later found 67 percent no longer had PTSD.  “If you were to design the perfect drug to treat PTSD, MDMA would be it,” said Rick Doblin, who three decades ago founded the California nonprofit behind the clinical trials.  It is no accident that the group — the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) — chose PTSD as its argu	0
"March 31, 2010 -- A widely prescribed drug used to shrink enlarged prostates appears to reduce the incidence of prostate cancer in men with an increased risk for the disease.  In a trial involving more than 8,000 men from 42 countries, those who took the drug Avodart had a 23% lower risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer over four years of treatment, compared to men who did not take the drug.  The risk reduction was similar to that seen in an earlier large trial of Proscar, another drug in the chemical class known as 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors.  The drugs work by blocking the conversion of testosterone into a key hormone associated with prostate growth.  While the studies suggest a role for Avodart and Proscar in the prevention of prostate cancer, experts tell WebMD that important questions remain about using the drugs for this purpose.  ""We now have two studies showing that two different drugs in this category can reduce the overall risk of prostate cancer,"" American Cancer Society Director of Prostate and Colorectal Cancers Durado Brooks, MD, tells WebMD. ""But we don't have studies saying that they decrease the risk of death from prostate cancer.""  A total of 8,231 men between the ages of 50 and 75 took part in the study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  All of the men had elevated blood levels of prostate specific antigen (PSA), which indicated an increased risk for prostate cancer. But none had evidence of cancer when biopsies were performed within six months of entering the trial.  Study researcher Gerald L. Andriole, MD, says a significant proportion of men screened for prostate cancer fall into this clinically ambiguous category of having elevated PSAs and negative biopsies.  ""We know from experience that many of these men are likely to have microscopic prostate tumors that were missed by their original biopsy,"" he says in a news release.  The men were assigned to receive either placebo treatments or daily 0.5-milligram doses of Avodart for four years. Scheduled biopsies were performed two and four years after they entered the trial."	0

John Foxx / Getty Images  An aspirin a day could keep skin cancer away, according to a new report in the journal Cancer.  Researchers in Denmark and the U.S. found that people taking common painkillers like aspirin and ibuprofen were less likely to develop skin cancer — including squamous cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma — especially when they took the drugs for at least seven years or used them at least twice a week. It’s not the first study to show a potential anticancer effect of aspirin and other similar painkillers — a class of medications known and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. Previous studies have found that aspirin users enjoyed a lower risk of colon cancer; a trial published earlier this year concluded that people who take a daily aspirin have as much as a 46% lower risk of colon, lung and prostate cancers, compared with non-users.  In the current trial, researchers looked at all cancer cases in the Danish Cancer Registry from 1991 to 2009 and compared this data against that of a prescription-drug database that recorded patients’ histories of using aspirin, NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors, drugs that all work in similar ways to reduce inflammation and dull pain.  (MORE: Will an Aspirin Prolong Your Life? It Depends)  Overall, 18,532 cases of skin cancer were included in the study. Each case was compared to 10 matched controls who did not develop the disease. Over the study period, people who filled more than two prescriptions for aspirin, NSAIDS or COX-2 inhibitors had a 13% lower risk of melanoma and a 15% lower risk of squamous cell carcinoma than those who filled fewer prescriptions, the researchers found.  The longer people took the drugs, and the higher the dose, the greater the anticancer benefit. Longer, higher-intensity use, for example, led to a 46% lower risk of melanoma, a 35% lower risk of squamous cell carcinoma and a 17% lower risk of basal cell carcinoma, the most common form of skin cancer in the U.S. The relationship held even after the researchers adjusted for potential confounders that could affect the risk of skin cancer, such as use of other medications. However, the researchers didn’t have information on other key skin cancer risk factors like exposure to UV radiation.  The drugs are thought to counter cancer growth by suppressing inflammatory pathways and stimulating tumors’ ability to expand and develop blood supplies.  “Given the high skin cancer incidence and the widespread and frequent use of NSAIDs, a preventive effect of these agents may have important public health implications,” the authors, led by Sigrun Alba Johannesdottir from Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark, wrote.  (MORE: Aspirin, a Wonder Drug? Studies Show It May Prevent Cancer)  In the U.S., skin cancer is the most common form of cancer diagnosed, affecting more than 2 million people each year. But taking aspirin and aspirin-like drugs isn’t without consequences: they may have harmful side effects on the stomach and digestive tract, causing bleeding and dangerous ulcers. (One COX-2 inhibitor, Vioxx, was voluntarily pulled from the market by its maker in 2004 after it was linked to an increased risk of heart disease.)  But given the growing body of data linking aspirin use to lower cancer risk, the researchers say it may be worth factoring in the drugs’ anticancer effects when patients and doctors discuss options for pain relievers. “We hope that the potential cancer-protective effect of NSAIDs will inspire more research on skin cancer prevention,” Johannesdottir said in a statement. “Also, this potential cancer-protective effect should be taken into account when discussing benefits and harms of NSAID use.”  Alice Park is a writer at TIME.

"TUESDAY, April 13, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Researchers report they've used magnets to guide stem cells to damaged areas of animal hearts.  The strategy appears to make it more likely that the heart will retain the cells, potentially boosting the power of cardiac stem cell therapy.  ""Stem cell therapies show great promise as a treatment for heart injuries, but 24 hours after infusion, we found that less than 10 percent of the stem cells remain in the injured area,"" Dr. Eduardo Marban, director of the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute in Los Angeles, said in a news release from the institute. ""Once injected into a patient's artery, many stem cells are lost due to the combination of tissue blood flow, which can wash out stem cells, and cardiac contraction, which can squeeze out stem cells. We needed to find a way to guide more of the cells directly to the area of the heart that we want to heal.""  Marban and colleagues developed a technique in which they loaded cardiac stem cells with microscopic bits of iron. Then they injected the cells into rats that had heart attacks and tried to manipulate the cells with a toy magnet.  The researchers found that magnetism attracted the stem cells to injured areas, tripling the retention rate in the heart.  ""Tissue viability is enhanced and heart function is greater with magnetic targeting,"" Marban said. ""This remarkably simple method could easily be coupled with current stem cell treatments to enhance their effectiveness.""  Marban and his wife, Linda, are founders of a company that has filed patents for the techniques.  The study was published online April 8 in the journal Circulation Research.

Tony Cenicola/The New York Times  More than a third of American adults use some form of complementary or alternative medicine, according to a government report. Natural remedies have an obvious appeal, but how do you know which ones to choose and whether the claims are backed by science? In this occasional series, the New York Times “Really?” columnist, Anahad O’Connor, explores the claims and the science behind alternative remedies that you may want to consider for your family medicine cabinet.  The Remedy: Honey  The Claim: It relieves coughing.  The Science: For decades, parents looking for an over-the-counter medicine to cure a child’s sickness and coughing have turned to syrupy medicines containing dextromethorphan, a popular cough suppressant found in products like Children’s Dimetapp DM and Robitussin DM.  But in 2007, a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel declared the products potentially harmful in small children and recommended a ban on many of them. As an alternative, many experts suggest something as simple as a spoonful of honey or even a small cup of flavored water, which have few side effects and seem to be effective.  The thinking is that sweet substances of any kind help soothe the back of the throat and break up mucus in the airways. Honey is also known to have antioxidant and antimicrobial properties.  In one double-blind study published in The Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, researchers recruited 105 children and teenagers who had coughs from upper-respiratory infections. The subjects were randomly divided into three groups: one that received no treatment, another that received one or two teaspoons of buckwheat honey, and a third that received a dose of honey-flavored dextromethorphan. Ultimately, the honey produced the greatest improvements when it came to better sleep and reduced cough frequency and severity.  The study was carried out by pediatricians at the Pennsylvania State University medical school and supported by a grant from the National Honey Board, an industry-backed agency of the Department of Agriculture.  In a similar study published in the journal Pediatrics in 2004, researchers recruited 100 children with upper respiratory tract infections who had been coughing for an average of over three days. The children were given a cough syrup with dextromethorphan, a cough syrup containing an antihistamine, or a placebo, which was essentially flavored water. Although children in all three groups experienced a reduction in coughing, those who received the flavored water fared the best.  The Risks: According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, honey may be useful in relieving coughing, but it should never be given to children under a year of age because in rare cases it can cause infantile botulism.	0
"Artificial intelligence can be used to spot Alzheimer's six years before a patient would normally be diagnosed, a study shows.  Doctors used the self-learning computer to detect changes in brain scans too subtle for humans to see.  The system was able to identify dementia in 40 patients an average of six years before they were formally diagnosed.  British AI expert Prof Noel Sharkey, from the University of Sheffield, said of the findings: ""This is exactly the sort of task that deep learning is cut out for - finding high-level patterns in data.  ""Although the sample sizes and test sets were relatively small, the results are so promising that a much larger study would be worthwhile.""  Boffins from the University of California trained the computer using more than 2,100 scans from 1,002 patients.  The scans measure brain activity by tracking the uptake of a radioactive liquid injected into the blood.  Research has linked the development of Alzheimer's to particular changes in certain brain regions but these can be difficult to spot.  The Alzheimer's algorithm was able to teach itself to recognize patterns in brain scans that indicated disease.  As a final test, it was given a set of 40 scans from 40 patients it had never studied before.  It proved to be 100 percent accurate at detecting Alzheimer's disease many years before the patient was later diagnosed.  Dr Jae Ho Sohn, who worked on the project, said: ""We were very pleased with the algorithm's performance.  ""It was able to predict every single case that advanced to Alzheimer's disease.""  Early detection of Alzheimer's could open the door to new ways of slowing down or even halting the progression of the disease.  Dr Carol Routledge, from Alzheimer's Research UK, said: ""The diseases that cause dementia begin in the brain up to 20 years before any symptoms start to show, presenting a vital window of opportunity for us to intervene before widespread damage occurs.  ""This study highlights the potential of machine learning to assist with the early detection of diseases like Alzheimer's, but the findings will need to be confirmed in much larger groups of people before we can properly assess the power of this approach.""  The research is published in the latest issue of the journal Radiology.  Click for more from The Sun."	1
To 62-year-old Hal Kaye, the injection of his own stem cells into his battered ankle was a miracle cure that saved him from debilitating surgery.  To the Food and Drug Administration, the treatment pioneered by a Broomfield doctor appears to be a misuse of a drug that requires licensing and federal scrutiny before it’s used on patients.  And that puts Dr. Chris Centeno on the front line of a simmering dispute over the use and regulation of adult stem cells, which can be cast as either a rogue therapy or breakthrough panacea.  Centeno says his procedure — Regenexx — is one of the first in the U.S. to bridge the gap between stem-cell research and actual treatment. Regenexx involves harvesting a patient’s cells from bone marrow, growing more in a lab and then injecting the tissue-repairing cells into damaged joints or even lumbar discs.  Kaye is one of 500 patients who, since 2006, have paid several thousand dollars for a chance to regain their youthful bounce with Centeno’s stem-cell therapy.  In Kaye’s case, the treatment ended years of pain that five orthopedists said could be fixed only by fusing his ankle.  Today, three years after his stem-cell treatment, Kaye says he plays golf “whenever it’s sunny.”  “I can walk anywhere now,” said Kaye, who hasn’t used a cane since his Regenexx treatment. “It’s been an incredible recovery.”  But the FDA says stem cells are really a type of drug that requires intensive study and licensing.  The agency sent Centeno a letter in 2008 warning him that lack of FDA licensing for Regenexx appeared to be in violation of the Public Health Service Act. The FDA asked Centeno to write a letter detailing “steps you have taken or will take to address the violations.”  Centeno, 46, sent a response to the FDA but said he has yet to receive a formal reply.  Centeno asserts that a person’s own stem cells, which he magnifies in a culture of the patient’s own blood in a controlled lab, are not a drug.  Dealing with the FDA  While Centeno circumvents the FDA, at least one other company is working with the agency to treat adults with their own stem cells.  In Louisiana, the 4-year-old TCA Cellular Therapy company has several ongoing FDA-approved clinical trials on humans, using patients’ own stem cells to treat heart and vascular diseases. The company is waiting for FDA review of its plan for clinical trials using stem cells to treat spinal cord injuries and Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis, or ALS, known as Lou Gehrig’s disease.  Centeno insists that the FDA exceeded its authority when, in an effort to prevent the spread of disease, it decided in 2005 that a patient’s own stem cells should be regulated as if they were being used on another human.  But the medical community largely has supported the change.  An October 2006 report in the New England Journal of Medicine analyzed the FDA’s updated regulation of stem-cell-based therapies. The report said researchers should be able to prove stem cells used won’t transmit disease and will be pure, effective and safe. The authors concluded existing regulations governing stem cells “provide an appropriate structure for ensuring the safety and efficacy of the next generation of stem-cell-based products.”  The International Cellular Medicine Society, which Centeno helped establish to set professional guidelines for adult stem-cell therapies and now counts 300 physicians in its ranks, is meeting this month with the FDA to discuss the issue of whether a patient’s own cells classify as a regulated drug.  A hard-line stance by the FDA could force Centeno to go abroad with his Regenexx procedure, which he licenses to other doctors. Already he is helping to open a Regenexx clinic in an orthopedic hospital in China that specializes in medical tourism and caters to patients seeking unconventional medical treatment.  Harvesting, cultivating and three injections of stem cells at Centeno’s clinic costs $8,000 and is not covered by most insurance policies.  Centeno’s treatment, three 10-minute injections, can flood an area with as many as 40 million stem cells — roughly the size of a pea. By comparison, microfracture, a surgical technique that involves creating tiny breaks in a bone, bathes an injured joint in a few hundred thousand stem cells.  “The body sometimes has a hard time getting enough stem cells to an area, and what we do is simply amplify the number of cells,” Centeno said.  Paul Pendleton is certain that adult stem-cell therapy could someday end joint-replacement surgery. He says it already saved him from replacing his knee.  He was about to give up decades of weightlifting and regular workouts when he found Centeno a year ago.  “It feels like my knee did 20 years ago. I’m back doing lunges, teaching my spinning classes,” said the 53-year-old petroleum engineer. “The knee seems kind of bulletproof to me. It was a solution that conventional medicine could not offer.”  Soon, regenerative stem-cell therapies like Centeno’s may not be so cutting edge. A s	0
"If all goes well for award-winning Plainfield inventor Matt Reavill, his new device will help save lives, decrease health care costs — and employ disabled veterans to boot.    Reavill won a prestigious contest in London late last year called the OmniCompete Health Pitch Battlefield, whose independent judges said his invention is a simple way to catheterize the heart. It reduces risks to an ""absolute minimum"" by moving the catheter insertion to the arm, the judges said, replacing a complex wire-guided procedure through the neck, which is typically used to monitor the heart during a hospital stay for very ill patients.    His breakthrough was also chosen by hospital-based clinical experts to participate in the 2010 Innovation Celebration, a national program run by Premier, a hospital-owned group purchasing organization. Premier Chief Operating Officer Mike Alkire says the products selected have the potential to improve safety and quality while cutting the cost of health care.    Reavill plans to hire 13 to 20 disabled vets to get the production off the ground — with the goal of hiring up to 18,000 if the device goes national. He recently procured a bank loan agreement and is hoping the award recognition and hospitals' willingness to try the catheter will attract a venture capitalist.    Called the ReavillMED CV, the Food and Drug Administration-cleared device includes a catheter called a PICC line, IV tubing that sheathes it to provide sterility, and a transducer that can directly measure blood pressure to help determine needed fluid levels. The catheter is inserted into the arm and travels to the heart within 20 to 30 seconds via the bloodstream. Traditional heart catheterization through a vein in the neck can take 20 minutes or longer.    Reavill likes to say it's ""stupidly simple"" because the individual parts have been around for decades, but no one had thought of this particular configuration before.    ""It's old technologies put together in a different way to enable established medical treatments to be done earlier,"" Reavill says.    It remains to be seen whether that saved time will result in saved lives. But because it's self-contained, the catheter theoretically should provide little margin for contamination that can lead to infection. It can be inserted in a nonsterile environment such as an emergency room.    In 1994, Reavill says, his father survived a complicated angioplasty with a high mortality rate, only to die three weeks later of a staph infection that was caused by a central line catheter inserted into his heart through a neck vein.    A venous heart catheter inserted through the neck, the traditional approach, requires painstaking preparation of the insertion area and a ""pseudo-operative field,"" says Dr. Andrew Dennis, attending surgeon at Stroger Hospital's trauma and burn units and a clinical researcher.    Dennis believes the ReavillMED CV shows a ""tremendous amount of promise,"" and he wants to test the first 50 catheters Reavill can provide. If the device lives up to expectations, the hospital will probably use it in patient resuscitation, Dennis said. He also plans to research whether quicker central venous catheterization improves patient resuscitation efforts.    Dennis adds that the catheter could prove useful in patients with sepsis, or blood poisoning, which strikes about 750,000 Americans every year. Of those, between 28 and 50 percent die, according to the National Institute of General Medical Sciences.    ""Once a person presents with septic shock, the catheter is an early aid that can guide the way a patient is managed,"" Dennis says. ""You get an objective number and it becomes less art, less gestalt and more evidence-based.""    Southern Illinois Healthcare, a three-hospital system that is considering use of Reavill's catheter, has a team of specially trained nurses who install catheters in the neck, says Dr. James Miller, chief medical officer. The nurses have a success rate in the ""high 90s,"" Miller says, but ""very few"" hospitals have devoted the time or resources to create the discipline.    Reavill says he may be proudest of his intention to hire disabled veterans in southern Illinois, a hard-hit region economically. He plans to bear the cost of any prostheses the veterans need to work on the catheters.    Reavill grew up on a pig farm in Robinson, in southeastern Illinois, and attended Southern Illinois University, which is supporting the development of the device.    ""My wife's family is from southern Illinois, too, so it's home,"" Reavill says."	1
* Average reductions of 0.8 pct seen in levels of A1C  * Better glucose control recorded over 1-year period  CHICAGO, June 29 (Reuters) - Medtronic Inc’s (MDT.N) insulin pump and monitoring device controlled blood glucose levels better than multiple daily injections in patients with Type 1 diabetes, according to a large post-market study.  Adult and pediatric patients using the pump and continuous glucose monitoring device saw reductions in levels of A1C, a commonly used measure of blood sugar, that were four times greater than those who received regular insulin injections in the study of 485 patients ranging from age 7 to 70.  Lowering A1C levels helps reduce the risk of long-term complications from diabetes such as eye, kidney and heart disease.  Patients in the study, which was presented at a meeting of the American Diabetes Association in Orlando, Florida, and sponsored by Medtronic, achieved better glucose control over a one-year period without an increase in hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar.  “What we’ve been able to show is that by combining this technology, you can lower the A1C, which reduces your risk of complications, and you can do it safely without increasing your rate of hypoglycemia,” said study author Dr. Richard Bergenstal, executive director of the International Diabetes Center at Park Nicollet Health Services in Minneapolis.  Multiple daily injections remain the most common approach to controlling blood sugar levels. Bergenstal said patients who are not achieving their goals with multiple daily injections should consider using a pump and sensor.  Diabetes association guidelines recommend that most people with diabetes maintain A1C levels of 7.0 percent or below.  In the study, patients on pump therapy saw a reduction in average A1C levels of 0.8 percent, compared with a 0.2 percent average reduction for those who received multiple injections. A1C levels on average decreased to 7.5 percent from a baseline of 8.3 percent in the group on pump therapy, but decreased to just 8.1 percent in the group receiving multiple injections.

"First of two parts  • Read part two: ALS strikes at random, killing young and old  • Graphic: What is ALS (Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis)?  Sometimes she glares at the painting of Jesus in her dining room.  ""I just let it loose,"" said Mary Kleiss at her Royal Oak home. ""I look at that picture and I say, 'You get down here and put on your boxing gloves and let's get this over with.' I am so damned angry.""  Her son, Regis, was diagnosed two and a half years ago with Lou Gehrig's disease -- amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, or ALS. It is, he writes, ""as if God is torturing me.""  The disease kills with stunning efficiency -- deadening its victims' peripheral nerves, withering muscles and, in a final assault, shutting down their ability to breathe. An estimated 30,000 people have it at any given time; 5,000 are diagnosed yearly. Most die within years. There is no cure.  The disease has reduced Regis Kleiss, 28, a formerly thick-bodied shot and discus thrower and captain of the track team at Dondero High School, to a bony echo of himself. Paralyzed except for some minor movement of his head, he will spend his final days on a feeding tube.  ALS leaves its victims' minds intact.  ""It's a miserable, damned disease,"" his mother said.  Now, a clinical trial overseen by the University of Michigan may provide hope. It is cutting-edge and audacious work -- the only ALS trial so far in which neural stem cells are injected directly into a patient's spinal cord. So far, 15 patients have undergone the procedure -- two of them twice -- as the FDA monitors its safety.  One patient showed a remarkable improvement for a while, though U-M's Dr. Eva Feldman, who heads the research, cautions not to read too much into that. The other 14 showed no improvement.  The trail is tentative and early. But when the rest of a person's life has been compressed to an expectancy of two to five years, it is hope nonetheless.  The trial has been based in Atlanta since 2010, but U-M has requested approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to expand it and move it to the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.  The trial involves injecting 500,000-1 million stem cells into the spine. The ancestry of the cells dates to the spinal cord of an aborted fetus in 2000. The cells are different from the embryonic stem cells that were the subject of a controversial ballot proposal in Michigan in 2008, when voters approved lifting the ban on embryonic stem cell research.  Feldman and others theorize that these new cells act as nursemaids to damaged nerve cells, sending out repair signals, and somehow halting the progression of the disease.  The procedure worked in rats. It has been shown to be safe in pigs.  If the FDA approves moving the trial to Ann Arbor, Michigan patients will have access to an experimental treatment that not only might offer insight into a disease that kills an estimated 15 Americans a day, but also push back the battle lines against other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's and Alzheimer's or Huntington's.  ""There is a lot of potential here,"" said Sue Burstein-Kahn, executive director of ALS of Michigan, a Southfield-based nonprofit.  Last month, Feldman flew down with a team of U-M staff for the 17th surgery in the trial, in anticipation that the trial might soon move to Ann Arbor. The trial has been at Emory University in Atlanta since it began, in part, because Feldman wanted a former U-M neurosurgery resident, Dr. Nicholas Boulis, who is now at Emory, to perform the delicate procedure. Boulis collaborated with Feldman on her research for seven years during his residency.  Feldman is clear and she repeats this often: This part of the trial tests safety only. By design, it doesn't  assess the efficacy of the treatment yet.  So the clinical trial patients so far -- all from the Atlanta area -- know the experimental stem cell therapy probably will not cure them. Still, they're empowered, knowing their participation might one day cure others, said Ed Tessaro, a retired Macy's executive, from his home overlooking a sparkling Georgian lake.  The following morning, Tessaro, 66, lay on an operating room table at Emory's hospital, as doctors sliced through his skin and muscle, removed part of the bone in his spine and laid bare a pulsating, bright-white spinal cord for a second infusion of stem cells.  ""It may kill us,"" Tessaro said of the disease, ""but it's not going to defeat us before we die.""  Serving a greater purpose  It was 2008 when a single misstep and near-stumble during a half-marathon in Bangkok, Thailand, first worried Tessaro. It happened more than once. His muscles weakened, even as he stepped up his time at the gym.  Months later, a fresh, young doctor delivered the news to him and his wife, Judy.  They remember it well, even now.  ""She said, 'It's the worst thing I could tell you,' "" Judy Tessaro recalled.  "" 'You have ALS, and you have two to four years to live,' "" Ed Tessaro added.  The doctor cried that day. "	0
Actress Marisa Tomei is one of among an estimated 5 million Americans who suffers from chronic dry eye (CDE), a condition that can cause symptoms such as itchiness, stinging, difficulty making tears and blurred vision. To raise awareness about CDE and help other people find relief, the “My Cousin Vinny” and “The Wrestler” star has teamed up with pharmaceutical company Allergan and Guide Dogs for the Blind, an organization that trains dogs and pairs them with visually impaired individuals.  After toting around eye drops, Tomei said she has found a solution with Allergan’s prescription drug RESTASIS®, which works by increasing the eyes’ natural ability to produce tears. CDE causes inflammation that can prevent tear production, according to Allergan.  Sometimes, individuals with CDE have trouble opening their eyes, but Tomei said she went to the doctor and reported mild but incessant itchiness and dryness, and was diagnosed with CDE.  She turned to RESTASIS® because she didn’t want to keep worrying about constantly using eye drops.  “It was as simple as going to the doctor, getting a prescription and trying RESTASIS®,” Tomei, 51, who stars in the upcoming “Spider-Man: Homecoming” movie, told FoxNews.com.  She decided to partner with Allergan not only because she found the prescription improved her quality of life but also because of the company’s relationship with Guide Dogs for the Blind. On Restasis.com, you can take the brand’s “dry eye quiz”— for every quiz taken, Allergan has agreed to donate $1 to the organization. When you visit the website, you’ll see a pop-up window with a portal to take the quiz.  Tomei, a self-proclaimed animal lover, expressed that the effort is close to her heart.  “A whole world of freedom opens up [for these individuals] because you can move about a city like this (New York City) or anywhere much more easily, and the dogs can become your eyes,” she said.  The quiz on Restasis.com can help individuals learn whether they’re a candidate for the drug. If you think you may be suffering from CDE, Tomei advised visiting your doctor to receive a diagnosis.

"Costly New Prostate Cancer Drug Works In Mysterious Ways  After decades of dreaming about getting patients' immune systems to fight cancer, immunotherapy is finally here. The Food and Drug Administration approved Provenge this spring to treat advanced prostate cancer.  But now the study that led to FDA approval is finally out in this week's New England Journal of Medicine. And it's clear that experts are still scratching their heads about just how Provenge works.  It does work, sort of.  In the study, men with prostate cancer that no longer responds to hormone therapy (basically, chemical castration) lived about four months longer if they took Provenge than if they got placebo treatment. That's better than the only other approved treatment for such advanced cancers.  But, as the study's lead author Dr. Philip Kantoff acknowledges, ""It's not a home run; this is not going to cure prostate cancer.""  The primary mystery is how Provenge extends life, since it doesn't shrink prostate tumors, as far as anyone can tell. ""Prolongation of survival without a measurable antitumor effect is surprising,"" writes Dr. Dan Longo of the National Institute on Aging in a NEJM editorial.  Deep in the data is further mystery.  Provenge is supposed to work by, in effect, vaccinating patients against their own cancers using a patient's own white blood cells.  The theory is that the custom-made vaccine incites patients' immune cells to attack the cancer. The study shows that patients who got Provenge were indeed more likely to mount immune-cell responses to a prostate cancer antigen in the test tube. But oddly, the patients who had these activated immune cells didn't survive any longer than those who didn't.  The other side of the immune system – the antibody arm -- showed a different picture. Patients who had a good antibody response to Provenge lived longer than those who didn't.  Nobody yet knows just how to explain these results. Longo, the NEJM editorialist, says he'd be more convinced if the placebo patients had received infusions of white blood cells that had been exposed just to the general immune-stimulating part of the Provenge treatment, without the prostate antigen part.  The way the study was done, he says, ""does not allow one to conclude"" that Provenge is working because it mobilizes the immune system specifically against prostate cancer.  But, after all, Provenge is just the first cancer immunotherapy on the market. So it's not surprising there's a lot to be learned, and that it's pretty pricey.  Other immunotherapy approaches are in the pipeline, along with fancier versions of drugs to block the hormones that feed prostate cancer.  Meanwhile, Dendreon, the Seattle-based company that makes Provenge, says there's a waiting list for the drug. The company estimates 100,000 American men have the kind of hormone-resistant, metastatic cancer the drug is approved to treat. But the company can only make enough at this point for 2,000 patients in the first year.  So does the waiting list contain thousands of men? Tens of thousands? ""Can't say,"" replies Dendreon COO Hans Bishop."	0
Early menopause is often a side effect for women treated with chemotherapy for breast cancer, but a new study reveals some guarded promise for preventing early menopause breast cancer patients. The results are published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.  While most breast cancer is diagnosed at later ages, about 6% of women learn that they're ill before age 40 - when they are still of childbearing age. Breast cancer treatments that have shown the best results for for disease free survival include chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or both. For younger women still hoping for children, these treatments can cause devastating short-term or long-term loss of menstrual periods, and loss of fertility. While many women choose to preserve the option of having children by storing eggs before cancer treatment, the process can be costly and difficult.  Italian researchers conducted a phase three study that included 281 women with breast cancer, aged 18 to 45 years and who had not experienced menopause. Patients were randomly selected to be treated with chemotherapy alone or with chemotherapy and triptorelin, a drug, called a GnRH analogue, that prevents the ovaries from releasing eggs. The researchers followed the women for one year after they had finished chemotherapy.  Among the women who had not received triptorelin, the rate of early menopause was 25.9%. Among the women who had received triptorelin, the rate of early menoapuse was 8.9%, which is 17% lower.  An accompanying editorial by Dr. Hope S. Rugo and Dr. Mitchell P. Rosen of the University of California-San Francisco says that trptorelin therapy should not be recommended as a standard treatment and should be approached with caution in women with hormone-sensitive disease. They also stress that women resuming their menstrual cycles does not mean the same thing as women preserving their fertility. They conclude that using assisted reproductive technology – such as storing eggs before chemo, is “the most effective option for fertility preservation.”	0
"Scientists Edge Closer To A Blood Test To Detect Cancers  Enlarge this image Andrew Lichtenstein/Getty Images Andrew Lichtenstein/Getty Images  Researchers say they have taken a step toward developing a blood test that would detect eight common cancers, possibly even before symptoms appear.  As they report Thursday in the journal Science, they're hoping their idea would eventually lead to a $500 test that can screen for cancer and identify people with the disease when it's in its earliest stages and more treatable.  But they have a long way to go.  There have been many attempts over the decades to develop blood tests to screen for cancers. Some look for proteins in the blood that appear with cancer. Others more recently have focused on DNA from tumors. But these methods alone don't give reliable results.  So Nickolas Papadopoulos, a professor of oncology and pathology at the Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Cancer Center, collaborated with many colleagues at the medical school to develop a new approach. It combines two methods into one test.  Their experimental test, dubbed CancerSEEK, focuses on eight major cancers: lung, breast, colon, pancreas, liver, stomach, ovary and esophagus.  ""We selected those eight cancers based on how frequent they are, also [because] a lot of them do not have any screening modality right now,"" Papadopoulos says.  The researchers looked at 1,005 people who had been diagnosed with these cancers. The blood test found signs of cancer in about 70 percent of them.  They also looked at 812 people without cancer diagnoses and found just seven of them — less than 1 percent — apparently had a false reading that found cancer. A low false-positive rate is critical for any test that could be used widely to screen people for cancer.  Of course, the ultimate goal of this test is to find cancer in people who haven't already been diagnosed. And that percentage could well be lower than the 70 percent average. For example, the test was successful only about 40 percent of the time in the patients the researchers studied with the earliest stage 1 cancers.  Though 40 percent success would be far from ideal, ""we still think this is a very important milestone in detecting cancers in asymptomatic people,"" Papadopoulos says. ""That could save their life.""  ""I am incredibly excited by this new paper,"" says Joshua Schiffman, an oncologist and cancer researcher at the Huntsman Cancer Center at the University of Utah who was not involved in the study. ""This is the paper that's going to set the field in motion.""  But Schiffman points out that there are many issues to work out – even assuming the test proves reliable among people who have not been previously diagnosed with cancer. For instance, if the success rate is around 40 percent at detecting cancer, that means it misses cancers more often than it finds it.  ""The thing we worry about quite often is ... if we have a test result that is negative we don't want to give false reassurance to the patient,"" he says. He is concerned that patients will think to themselves, ""Even though I have this weird stomach pain that won't go away, I know it's not cancer. I'm not going to go to the doctor because the CancerSEEK test told me it was negative,"" Schiffman says. ""And that would be a terrible thing.""  Another problem is that the test results find signs of cancer, but often fail to pinpoint which part of the body is affected. ""That's a tremendous problem that has to be overcome,"" he says.  ""We've come about one step in a thousand-mile journey,"" says Vinay Prasad, an oncologist and cancer researcher at the Oregon Health and Science University who was not involved in the study.  First, he notes, the Hopkins team will need to demonstrate that the test will be useful in patients without symptoms. Then the researchers will need to show that the rate of false alarms remains very low, otherwise people will be sent on needless and expensive medical odysseys.  And for the test to be useful, ""you've got to find cancer that's going to otherwise be lethal, and not cancer that would otherwise be destined to do nothing,"" Prasad says.  That's been a huge problem with previous cancer screening tests, especially for prostate cancer and breast cancer, and has led to pointless and potentially dangerous treatments, he says.  An effective screening test would hold lots of potential for cancer patients, Prasad says.  ""We want this to be true, we hope that this is true, but we have learned through 30, 40, 50 years of cancer screening that we have to do the right studies at the outset to know that it's true,"" Prasad says.  The scientists at Hopkins have already launched their next study, which could involve tens of thousands of apparently healthy volunteers who are enrolled in the Geisinger Health Plan in Pennsylvania. Their experience will help answer the next big question, which is whether CancerSEEK will pick up cancer in people who don't have symptoms.  If that multiyear experiment succeeds, "	0
No one wants to hear that he or she has Alzheimer’s disease. But if the beta-amyloid plaques that are the disorder’s key physical hallmark could be detected before memory loss and cognitive troubles were evident to all, would you want to know? And since no treatment currently works to stem the inexorable progress ofAlzheimer’s, who would pay for a costly test to detect it early -- and why?  Those questions are no longer hypothetical. Last week, the FDA approved an agent called Florbetapir F 18 injection (to be marketed as Amyvid), which will allow physicians using a positron emissions tomography (PET) scan to detect the presence and extent of amyloid plaques in patients concerned about declining mental function.  And on Monday, the American Academy of Neurology released a new study showing that an agent called florbetaben also allowed detection of amyloid plaques when used with a PET scan. The florbetaben study is to be presented at the academy’s “Emerging Science” program next week in New Orleans. Both Florbetapir F 18 and florbetaben help diagnose Alzheimer’s by sticking to beta amyloid clumps and emitting radioactivity, which can then be picked up by a PET scan.  Until recently, the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease could be made only after a patient’s death, when a pathologist could find physical evidence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. A brain biopsy now can be used to detect Alzheimer’s plaques but is highly invasive and may miss parts of the brain where the plaques and tangles of Alzheimer’s are densest. While diagnosis by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy is under study for early detection, accurate early detection by such noninvasive means is a ways away.  Advertisement  The FDA says that Amyvid “is not a test to predict the development of AD-associated dementia” in those who have no problematic symptoms. It’s an early test for those who already have cognitive concerns and who wonder whether Alzheimer’s disease may be the cause. Among patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, about 60% have amyloid plaques and will go on to develop dementia that is likely Alzheimer’s disease, said Dr. Michael W. Weiner of the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Center for Imaging of Neurodegenerative Diseases.  Weiner is the leading researcher on the largest and most comprehensive Alzheimer’s research initiative of its kind, the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. ADNI, a nationwide consortium that is still enrolling subjects, is a five-year, $60-million project that will track 800 participants to compare how mental and daily-life skills, and the brain’s structure and function, change in those aging normally, those with mild cognitive impairment and those with dementia. Weiner conducted much of the research leading to Amyvid’s approval.  For now, says Weiner, there is “no consensus” on which patients should get the costly new PET scans that use Amyvid, and large insurers such as Medicare and Medicaid have not made decisions about coverage for such tests. And some patients may question whether they would want to know that the source of their mental troubles is Alzheimer’s disease, said Weiner.  “But for many, when you take a person to the doctor, you usually want an answer, whether it leads to a treatment or not. This is a way of getting closer to an answer,” said Weiner. Many patients experiencing cognitive lapses may also be reassured if the test fails to reveal amyloid plaques, he added.  Advertisement  With growing understanding that the changes of Alzheimer’s disease may be decades in the making, the value of early detection is gaining adherents, said Weiner. The “real game-changer,” he says, will be when one of the many experimental therapies under study for Alzheimer’s disease succeeds in blocking or reversing its progress. Once that happens, physicians, researchers and insurers will need to figure out who should get the test and at what cost, and who will pay.	0
"The Gentle Cesarean: More Like A Birth Than An Operation  There are many reasons women need cesareans. Sometimes the situation is truly life-threatening. But often the problem is that labor simply isn't progressing. That was the case for Valerie Echo Duckett, 35, who lives in Columbus, Ohio. After receiving an epidural for pain, Duckett's contractions stopped. By late evening she was told she'd need a C-section to deliver her son, Avery. Duckett says she has vague memories of being wheeled into the operating room, strapped down and shaking from cold.  ""They were covering me up with warm blankets,""she says. ""I kind of slept in and out of it."" Her only memory of meeting her newborn son for the first time was from some pictures her husband took.  I felt that I hadn't earned the right to say I gave birth to him.  This is the experience many women have. The cesarean section is the most common surgery in America — about 1 in 3 babies is delivered this way. But for many women, being told they need a C-section is unpleasant news. Duckett says she felt like she missed out on a pivotal moment in her pregnancy.  ""It took me a long time even to be able to say that I gave birth to Avery,"" she says. ""I felt like I didn't earn the right to say I gave birth to him, like it was taken from me somehow, like I hadn't done what I was supposed to do.""  Duckett's reaction to her C-section is unfortunately a common one, says Betsey Snow, head of Family and Child Services at Anne Arundel Medical Center, a community hospital in Annapolis, Md.  ""I hear a lot of moms say, 'I'm disappointed I had to have a C-section.' A lot of women felt like they failed because they couldn't do a vaginal delivery,"" says Snow.  Now some hospitals are offering small but significant changes to the procedure to make it seem more like a birth than major surgery.  In a typical C-section, a closed curtain shields the sterile operating field. Mothers don't see the procedure and their babies are immediately whisked away for pediatric care — a separation that can last for close to half an hour. Kristen Caminiti, of Crofton, Md., knows this routine well. Her first two sons were born by traditional cesarean. She was happy with their births because, she says, it was all she knew. Then, just a few weeks into her third pregnancy, Caminiti, who is 33, saw a post on Facebook about family-centered cesarean techniques catching on in England.  ""I clicked on the link and thought, 'I want that,' "" she says.  The techniques are relatively easy and the main goals simple: Let moms see their babies being born if they want and put newborns immediately on the mother's chest for skin-to-skin contact. This helps stimulate bonding and breast feeding. Caminiti asked her obstetrician, Dr. Marcus Penn, if he'd allow her to have this kind of birth. He said yes.  When Caminiti told Penn what she wanted, his first thought was it wouldn't be that difficult to do. ""I didn't see anything that would be terribly out of the norm,"" he says. ""It would be different from the way we usually do it, but nothing terrible that anyone would say we shouldn't try that.""  It was the most amazing and grace-filled experience to finally have that moment of having my baby be placed on my chest.  Family-centered cesareans are a relatively new idea in the U.S., and many doctors and hospitals have no experience with them. Penn and the staff at Anne Arundel Medical Center quickly realized the procedure would require some changes, including adding a nurse and bringing the neonatal team into the operating room.  And there were a bunch of little adjustments, such as moving the EKG monitors from their usual location on top of the mother's chest to her side. This allows the delivery team to place the newborn baby immediately on the mother's chest. In addition, Penn says, the mother's hands were not strapped down and the intravenous line was put in her nondominant hand so she could hold the baby.  At the beginning of October, Caminiti underwent her C-section. She was alert, her head was up and the drape lowered so she could watch the delivery of her son, Connor. Caminiti's husband, Matt, recorded the event. After Connor was out, with umbilical cord still attached, he was placed right on Caminiti's chest.  ""It was the most amazing and grace-filled experience to finally have that moment of having my baby be placed on my chest,"" Caminiti says. ""He was screaming and then I remember that when I started to talk to him he stopped. It was awesome.""  And the baby stayed with her for the rest of the procedure.  Changes like this can make a big difference, says Dr. William Camann, the director of obstetric anesthesiology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and one of the pioneers of the procedure in the U.S. At Brigham and Women's, their version of the family-centered cesarean is called the gentle cesarean. Moms who opt for it can view the birth through a clear plastic drape, and immediate skin-to-skin contact follows.  Cama"	0
"En Español  MONDAY, Oct. 15, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- A large amount of beta amyloid, or ""plaques,"" in the brain may trigger more significant memory loss in healthy older people than the genetic risk factor associated with Alzheimer's disease, known as the APOE ɛ4 allele, according to new research from Australia.  ""Our finding that brain-plaque-related memory decline can occur while people still have normal memory and thinking shows that these plaque-related brain changes can be detected and measured while older people are still healthy,"" said study author Yen Ying Lim, of the University of Melbourne. ""This provides an enormous opportunity for understanding the development of early Alzheimer's disease and even a sound basis for the assessment of plaque-targeting therapies.""  The researchers had nearly 150 older adults with no thinking or memory problems undergo a PET brain scan. The participants, who were an average age of 76, also were tested for the APOE gene.  The group's brain function was monitored for 18 months using computer-based tests, card games and having the participants memorize word lists.  The study results are published in the Oct. 16 issue of the journal Neurology.  Over the course of the study, the people who began with more brain plaques had up to 20 percent greater decline on the computer-based assessments of memory than the people who had fewer brain plaques.  The researchers also found the participants who carried the APOE gene had greater memory loss than those who did not have this genetic risk factor. They noted, however, that carrying the gene did not affect memory decline associated with the plaques.  ""Our results show that plaques may be a more important factor in determining which people are at greater risk for cognitive impairment or other memory diseases such as Alzheimer's disease,"" Lim said in a journal news release. ""Unfortunately, testing for the APOE genotype is easier and much less costly than conducting amyloid imaging.""  Although the researchers discovered an association between plaques and increased memory loss, they did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship.

"Numerous studies in recent years have suggested that vitamins and supplements have no beneficial effect on your health. Some researchers have gone as far as to warn that popping them may be harmful.  But the fact is that most of us cannot get the vitamins and minerals we need from food alone, and multivitamins are vital to bridging that gap. According to a study published in the January 2015 edition of the Journal of the American College of Nutrition, roughly 40 percent of adults are deficient in vitamin A, C, D, E, calcium and magnesium. These findings suggest many people may not even have the nutrient levels they need to stave off disease— let alone thrive and live in optimal health. As I see it, everyone needs a multivitamin for disease prevention, and new research agrees.  ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT  Another study, published in the January 2015 edition of the journal Postgraduate Medicine, suggests that 68,000 cancers per year would be prevented with daily multivitamin use. The study followed only men, but my take is there’s no reason to assume this doesn’t apply to women as well. In the study, multivitamins lowered cancer risk by 27 percent among men with a history of cancer and by 8 percent among men with no history of the disease. This new study used a randomized, controlled trial design— a method that is considered to be the “gold standard” for proof in medical science.  I’ve always recommended targeted vitamin supplementation to my patients because when you boost levels of key nutrients in your body, you give yourself the best chances of preventing cancer, heart disease, dementia and other diseases.  While several previous studies failed to prove the benefits of some vitamins, the fact is, many of those studies have been criticized for poor design and are the reason fewer tangible benefits have been proven. At the very least, you should be taking a multivitamin every day. That said, not all multivitamins are created equal— some contain cheaper and less absorbable forms of nutrients, so you won’t get their full benefits, and others have ingredients you should be wary of.  Here are a few tips for selecting a high-quality multivitamin that will help you look and feel your best:  Go for high quality  When you look at a typical multivitamin label at the drugstore, you’ll see it has about 100 percent of the daily values recommended for a nutrient. The federal government developed these values during World War II to prevent widespread nutrient deficiency— so while that amount should be enough to make sure you have what you need to survive, it won’t necessarily be enough for optimal health.  In some of the higher-quality supplements, you'll see things like Vitamin B-6 at 2,500 percent of your daily value. That may sound wacky, but keep in mind that 100 percent is just the level for basic survival— and that 2,500 percent is going to give you more of what you actually need to feel good. Look for high-quality brands with these higher doses. Because I know there can be a lot of guesswork when it comes to finding a good multivitamin, I created my own formula specifically designed to provide key nutrients that boost your energy, which is available on my website.  Get one that will be absorbed well by your body  Some forms of vitamins are better absorbed in your body. When scanning the label, look for B12 as methylcobalamin as opposed to cyanocobalamin, and when it comes to folic acid, look for methyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF) rather than straight folic acid. Both are forms of B9, but MTHF is the form of B9 found in nature. For vitamin A, look for beta carotene and mixed carotenoids, which are derived from plants and are water soluble. And look for vitamin D3 as opposed to D2. Seventy years ago, these two forms of vitamin D were seen as equals, but recent research has shown that D3 is a more potent form of D.  Avoid toxic fillers  Some vitamin companies use colorants and coatings that may be harmful. These include hydrogenated oils, artificial colors, magnesium stearate and titanium dioxide. Magnesium stearate could even compromise your immunity— a study in the journal Immunology found that stearic acid suppresses T cells, a key part of your immune system. The vitamins you take should enhance your health, so be sure to scan the labels for these cheap additives and steer clear of them.

Now, researchers report that a new program shows it might be possible to reduce both catheter use and its associated infections.  ""Catheter-associated urinary tract infections are common and costly patient safety problems,"" said lead researcher Dr. Sanjay Saint. He is a professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.  Roughly 250,000 such infections occur in hospitals each year in the United States, costing about $250 million, the researchers pointed out.  Although about 20 percent of hospitalized patients get a urinary catheter, one-third of the time they aren't needed, Saint said. He believes that patients can play a role in reducing catheter use.  ""A lot of patients and families don't realize that there are problems with a urinary catheter, so they may request them because they think it will allow patients to stay in bed,"" Saint said.  ""Unfortunately, there are side effects with a catheter. And I've seen patients who have gotten up in the middle of the night and they trip and fall on the tubing,"" he explained.  ""Patients and families should request that a catheter not be put in, and if there is one there, the patient should ask every day whether it is still needed,"" Saint suggested.  For the study, Saint and his colleagues tried the new program in 600 hospitals.  After 18 months of using the program, infection rates among hospital patients in general wards dropped by one-third, while catheter use had dropped about 1 percent.  But there was no drop in infections or catheter use in intensive care units (ICUs), the study findings showed.  Hospital-acquired urinary tract infection rates rose nationwide during the same time period, Saint noted.  The program Saint helped develop -- called the ""bladder bundle"" -- includes protocols, checklists, training and information-sharing that help doctors and nurses reduce catheter use and prevent infections.  Included in the program are:  Daily checks to see if a catheter is still needed.  Using other options to collect urine, such as bedpans.  Training for managing urinary catheters.  Use of infection-control techniques for catheter placement and maintenance.  Feedback to the medical team about catheter use and infection rates.  The researchers found that catheter infection rates in the new program dropped 14 percent overall in general wards (non-ICU).  The findings were published June 2 in the New England Journal of Medicine.  Dr. Susan Huang, a professor of infectious disease at the University of California, Irvine, wrote an editorial accompanying the study. She said, ""While we've known the correct care processes for managing urinary catheters, we haven't been able to reliably reduce catheter-related infections.""  An intervention that focuses on changing the culture in hospitals to make them more responsive to the problem of infection control -- one that involves ""rallying around a focused problem and ensuring team-based solutions -- is integral to improving infection control in hospitals,"" she said.  As for improving infection control in intensive care units, Huang said, ""further analysis may help us understand why this intervention didn't work.""  ""This program can reduce urinary infections in hospitals if a team is assembled to ensure adoption of best practices and to rapidly correct reasons for failing to comply with these processes,"" she added.

"Drugs To Prevent Weak Bones Linked To Unusual Fractures In Women  There's fresh evidence pointing to a troubling link between commonly used osteoporosis drugs and a rare type of thighbone fracture.  Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of NASA Courtesy of NASA  When a hip bone breaks because of osteoporosis, the fracture usually involves either the ball at the top of the femur or the narrow neck just below the ball. The unusual fractures that may be associated with certain osteoporosis drugs called bisphosphonates occur lower on the bone. Ironically, that's where the femur, the longest bone in the body, is usually strongest.  These unusual fractures can occur suddenly without any trauma, such as a fall. And they can be complex breaks that are difficult to fix and slow to heal.  In the study, published in current issue of JAMA, researchers looked at 716 of these fractures in more than 200,000 Ontario women who had taken bisphosphonates.  Women who had taken the drugs for five years or longer had nearly a three times higher risk of suffering atypical fractures compared with women who had only transient exposure to such drugs.  That's called the relative risk, and it seems alarming. But the ""absolute risk"" of these unusual fractures is still pretty low — 13 fractures per year for every 10,000 people taking bisphosphonates for five years or longer. That is, long-term users have a risk of about a tenth of 1 percent.  Moreover, the study verified that long-term use of bisphosphonate drugs reduces the risk of typical osteoporosis fractures by 24 percent. That's obviously a lot more benefit than risk.  ""The big message really is the number of typical hip fractures is much, much larger than the number of unusual thigh fractures,"" says Dr. Gillian Hawker of St. Michael's Hospital in Ontario, an osteoporosis specialist and study author. ""So although we believe there is an increased risk of these unusual fractures, it doesn't outweigh the benefit"" of taking osteoporosis drugs.  Merck, which makes Fosamax, the original and leading bisphosphonate drug, criticizes the new study. The company said in a statement to Shots that women who had atypical fractures were different from those who didn't. For instance, they started out with a history of more fractures, so the comparison isn't valid.  ""Merck believes that the results must be interpreted with caution and should not be overstated,"" says the company's statement.  Still, the accumulating evidence that there is a risk of these serious, unusual fractures associated with bisphosphonates is getting a lot of attention in the medical community.  Last fall the Food and Drug Administration issued a ""safety update"" urging doctors and patients to be on the lookout for the problem. Often, the FDA says, an atypical fracture is preceded by pain in the thigh, apparently from a small stress fracture that signals bone weakness. ""Although it is not clear if bisphosphonates are the cause, these unusual femur fractures have been predominantly reported in patients taking bisphosphonates,"" the FDA says.  The concern is heightened by another, even rarer possible side effect – osteonecrosis of the jaw. Basically, it means that part of the jawbone dies.  Some reports – including one published earlier this month in the Journal of Dental Research — have found a higher risk of the jaw problem in dental patients taking bisphosphonates.  Again, Merck disputes the connection. Earlier this month it convinced a New Jersey jury that Fosamax did not cause one woman's jaw problems.  Amid all the debate, many specialists are wondering if women on bisphosphonates should take a ""holiday"" from the drug from time to time. The idea is that perhaps they'd get the osteoporosis benefit without the risks of osteonecrosis and unusual fractures. ""You could do five years on, five years off,"" Dr. Clifford Rosen, a bone specialist at Maine Medical Center, tells Shots. ""Some people are doing three on and three off.""  But at some point, should these patients start taking the drug again? ""I don't think anybody knows,"" Rosen says. ""The thought is you would have to put them back on at some time."""	0

"Outside of heart attacks, doctors are often too quick to use a common $20,000 procedure to treat patients suffering from coronary artery disease, a new study suggests.  About 600,000 angioplasty procedures, which almost always involve placement of a tiny metal tube called a stent, are done in the U.S. each year. Roughly 70% of these procedures are performed on patients suffering symptoms of a heart attack and aren't medically controversial. But the remainder are done on stable patients who are suffering mild symptoms or no symptoms at all. Of those, 50% are deemed appropriate, 38% uncertain and 12% inappropriate, the report says.  ""One in eight is probably higher than we would like,"" said Paul Chan, a cardiologist at Saint Luke's Mid America Heart and Vascular Institute, Kansas City, Mo., and the study's lead author.  The results, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association Tuesday, come amid rising concern about the overuse of big ticket medical technology. Such concerns are rising not only in cardiology, but in other major specialties as state and federal governments and health insurers seek to contain health-care costs.  ""This tends to confirm concerns that many people have expressed—that there are many thousands of patients who undergo coronary interventions for very questionable indications,"" said Steven Nissen, head of cardiovascular medicine at the Cleveland Clinic.  Researchers cautioned that the findings are complicated and include some results that are reassuring and others that are troubling. The study is part of an unusual initiative by the American College of Cardiology to examine the extent of unnecessary procedures in part because of growing concerns in recent years that angioplasty and especially stents are overused.  It comes just days after a separate initiative in the field of spine surgery. Last week, The Spine Journal, the official publication of the North American Spine Society, published a study revealing that surgeons who collectively received tens of millions of dollars from medical-device giant Medtronic Inc. failed to report serious complications in a dozen research papers they wrote about a Medtronic bone-growth protein.  As health-care costs continue to soar, reaching $2.5 trillion in the U.S. in 2009, medical societies are becoming more open to self-scrutiny for fear that the federal government and private health insurers will make medical decisions for them. Some organizations are also mindful that conflicts of interest undermine the credibility of their fields.  One big warning sign that stents were likely being implanted unnecessarily in some patients came in 2007 when the New England Journal of Medicine published a study known as ""Courage"" by a Buffalo, N.Y. cardiologist named William Boden. The Courage study, which tracked 2,287 patients for five years, showed stents weren't any better than a cocktail of medicines to treat patients suffering from chronic but stable chest pain.  Last December, the Senate Finance Committee released a report on a Maryland cardiologist, Mark Midei, who allegedly performed unnecessary angioplasties on hundreds of patients. Dr. Midei was suspended by his hospital, St. Joseph Medical Center in Towson, Md., and charged with unprofessional conduct by the Maryland State Board of Physicians.  The Senate report revealed that Abbott Laboratories, ABT -0.14% one of the biggest makers of stents, hired Dr. Midei as a sales consultant after St. Joseph's barred him from operating on patients. Abbott also feted Dr. Midei in 2008 with a $1,407 pig roast when he implanted 30 stents in a single day, setting what may have been a company record.  After Dr. Midei's departure, the number of patients who received stents at St. Joseph's fell to 116 in 2009 from 350 the year before. Dr. Midei has denied the allegations and sued St. Joseph for damaging his career. His lawyer couldn't immediately be reached for comment. Abbott has said its affiliation with him ended in early 2010, and has declined to comment on the specifics of the relationship. The company declined to comment about Tuesday's JAMA study. A spokeswoman for St. Joseph's said Dr. Midei's privileges remain suspended and he hasn't performed any cardiac catheterizations on patients there since May 12, 2009.  Medicare paid some $25.7 billion for stent procedures in the six years through 2009, according to the Senate report. However, use of the devices has leveled off amid the controversy, leading one of the field's biggest players, Johnson & Johnson, JNJ -1.03% to announce last month that it would stop making stents.  The new study is from data submitted by 1,091 hospitals—about 80% of those which perform angioplasty and stent procedures in the U.S.—to the National Cardiovascular Data Registry, which is maintained by the cardiology college.  The study looked at data from 500,154 procedures, which doctors call percutaneous coronary interventions, or PCI, and compared them against appropriatenes"	0
"A perfect sleeping pill — one that gets people to fall asleep faster, and for a longer period of time, with no side effects — is still a dream.  Such a magic pill could potentially solve many problems. Millions of Americans don't get enough sleep. In a recent survey, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that 35 percent of Americans are sleeping fewer than seven hours per night, the recommended healthy amount.  Good sleep doesn't just boost our feelings of well-being. There's a growing scientific consensus that it protects us against heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. In sleep labs, participants who have their sleep cycles severely thrown off for just three weeks can start to appear pre-diabetic on blood tests. (If you doubt the importance of sleep consider this: Scientists now believe that cycles of restfulness and alertness are core organizing principles of all life on Earth. Even the tiniest single-cell organisms contain the genetic coding for a circadian rhythm.)  Ever wonder how your mind works? Watch The Mind, Explained, our 5-part miniseries on the workings of the brain. Available to stream now on Netflix.  Of course, there are many prescription sleep aids on the market; unfortunately, they aren't very effective and can be addictive and dangerous.  So many prefer to walk into a corner drug store and buy an alternative for just $6 that's marketed as safe and all natural. It's melatonin, and unlike other chemicals sold as nutrition supplements in America, there's some scientific evidence to back up its claims.  But like all sleep drugs, melatonin's story is complicated. Despite the fact it's a chemical that our bodies naturally produce during sleep, how melatonin actually works, and what it's best for, is worth a good, hard look.  What is melatonin?  Melatonin was originally discovered in the 1950s, when a dermatology lab thought it played a role in skin pigmentation. The researchers all took a massive dose of their newfound chemical, expecting their skin to lighten. But they just got sleepy.  What scientists eventually realized about melatonin is this: It's the hormone that tells the body when it is nighttime. It's made in the pineal gland, a pinecone-shaped structure located deep in the brain.  ""In lower vertebrates like the frog, the pineal is in fact a third eye — it’s a light-dark receptor,"" Dick Wurtman, a MIT cognitive scientist who help discover melatonin's function in humans, says. Scientists once assumed that it had served a function in mammals but had become a vestigial organ, bound to ""disappear in a few million years,"" Wurtman says.  In the 1960s, Wurtman and his team at MIT found that light does still reach the pineal in mammals — through the eyes — and controls the release of melatonin. During the day, melatonin is inhibited by light. At night, it flows into the bloodstream — unless we're around bright light or blue light, which suppress the release of melatonin, and keep us up.  When it does reach the bloodstream, melatonin acts as a messenger. How the body responds to the message depends on the animal. Rats, for instance, are nocturnal, so melatonin may play a role in keeping them awake. In humans and other day-dwelling creatures, it prepares the body for rest and helps maintain that rest throughout the night.  In humans, melatonin is thought to promote sleep in two ways.  1. The exact pathway isn't well understood, but it's believed melatonin broadly suppresses the areas of the brain involved in wakefulness. Melatonin may also play a role in lowering body temperature, which is needed for sleep.  2. Melatonin helps set the overall pace of the master circadian clock in the body. Scientists have shown that when people are given melatonin in the afternoon, their body clocks can be tricked into thinking it's later, and they get sleepier sooner. This can be handy if you're suffering from jet lag, and your body thinks it's still in an earlier time zone. (More on this later.)  So how well does melatonin work?  When assessing melatonin, there are a couple of big questions researchers are asking:  Does it help people with insomnia fall asleep faster?  Does it help people stay asleep?  Does it help people sleep in new time zones?  Is it helpful for people adjusting to new shifts at work?  And does it reliably shift a person's body clock to a new phase?  The studies that have been done on these questions have tested a wide range of doses on many different populations, which makes direct comparisons among studies very difficult, and limits what we can really learn from them. But the meta analyses of melatonin that do exist does find some evidence that it can be helpful in regard to most of the above questions.  Patty Deuster, a research scientist at Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences, was the senior author on a 2014 systematic review on melatonin. She and her team amassed a total of 35 randomized, placebo-controlled studies on healthy people with or without a di"	0

"The program worked. The women who took the 10-week stress-management class shortly after surgery reported feeling better and having fewer depressive symptoms such as anxiety than those who took a one-day, breast-cancer education session.  Jamie Stagl worries that women with breast cancer don't get enough help coping with their diagnosis. Cancer upends a woman's daily routine, her sense of her body, her vision of the future. There's almost nothing more stressful.  The women felt better one year after the course, five years later, and — according to a new study published last month in the journal Cancer — an average of 11 years later. (Stagl and her colleagues tracked down 100 of the original participants; another 30 had died; and 110 couldn't be found or didn't want to participate.)  The positive results surprised even Stagl. ""It's quite amazing,"" she said.  Advertisement  Stagl doesn't know whether the women are still using the techniques they were taught — which include mindfulness, deep breathing, visual imagery, cognitive behavioral therapy, and learning how to ask for help from friends and family. But the study suggests that they have internalized the strategies.  Women may be particularly receptive to these approaches when they're coping with a cancer diagnosis, said Laura S. Porter, an associate professor at Duke University Medical Center. ""This is really a teachable moment.""  The skills taught in the course are useful at many stressful moments, Porter said, not just when cancer is diagnosed. But most people aren't explicitly trained how to cope with stressful events.  ""These are really good life skills,"" Porter said. ""While I certainly wouldn't say that anyone could take a 10-week course and be set for life, I think anyone could take a 10-week course and be much better at coping with stress.""  Advertisement  Next, the study team, led by Michael Antoni of the University of Miami, hopes to show that an easier-to-manage five-week group class works as well as the 10-week one.  And researchers want to know whether relaxation actually reduces the recurrence of breast cancer. It makes biological sense, Stagl said. Stress drives up levels of the hormone cortisol, which is known to weaken the immune system. If a woman's stress level remains high indefinitely after diagnosis, she may have a worse outcome than if she can bring it back down, Stagl said.  KAREN WEINTRAUB"	1
"En Español  MONDAY, Oct. 31, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Doctors who listen to Mozart while performing colonoscopies may spot more precancerous growths, researchers suggest.  Better detection of these so-called adenomatous polyps could save lives, the study authors noted, as survival rates for colorectal cancer are better than 90 percent if the disease is detected early.  Previous research has shown that Mozart's music can provide a significant short-term boost to spatial-temporal reasoning, which involves a person's ability to compare and transform mental images in space and time. Researchers set out to determine if this phenomenon, called the ""Mozart Effect,"" played a role in the detection rates of precancerous polyps during colonoscopies.  In their small study, two doctors performed endoscopies either while listening to Mozart or with no music at all. Both doctors improved their detection rates of potentially dangerous adenomatous polyps when they listened to music compared with their pre-study (""baseline"") rates, the investigators found. But while both doctors had better results compared to their baseline rates, one doctor did slightly better in procedures without music than with music during the study.  Detection rates for the first doctor were about 67 percent while listening to music and 30 percent with no music. This was up from a baseline detection rate of 21 percent before the study began.  However, the second doctor had an adenoma detection rate of nearly 37 percent with Mozart and 40 percent without the music, compared with a baseline detection rate of 27 percent.  ""Both endoscopists had higher adenoma detection rates listening to music when compared with their baseline rates,"" lead researcher Dr. Catherine Noelle O'Shea, of the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, said in an American College of Gastroenterology news release.  The study authors suggested that the findings could help reduce the number of people affected by invasive colorectal cancer -- the third most common cancer diagnosed in men and women in the United States, according to background information in the news release. When spotted early, potentially dangerous polyps can be removed during colonoscopies, preventing the development of disease.  ""Adenoma detection rate is linked to a reduction in colorectal cancer incidence, so it is an important quality indicator for colonoscopy,"" said O'Shea. ""Anything we can do to get those rates up has the potential to save lives. While this is a small study, the results highlight how thinking outside the box -- in this case using Mozart -- to improve adenoma detection rates can potentially prove valuable to physicians and patients.""  The study was slated for presentation Monday at the American College of Gastroenterology's annual meeting in Washington, D.C. Because this study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

The logo of Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis is seen on its headquarters building in Basel, Switzerland October 27, 2015. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo  LONDON (Reuters) - The first new asthma pill in decades has produced promising results in a small clinical trial, potentially paving the way for another treatment option for patients by the end of the decade.  Fevipiprant, which is being developed by Novartis, reduced a biological marker of asthma nearly five-fold in the 12-week trial involving 61 patients, researchers said on Saturday. No serious adverse events were reported.  Larger and longer studies are now needed to prove that the twice-daily pill can also reduce severe asthma attacks, known as exacerbations. Novartis believes the medicine could be filed for regulatory approval in around 2019.  Pills for asthma used to be standard treatment 40 or 50 years ago, but those older products were often associated with worrying side effects. They have since been replaced by inhalers that deliver small amounts of drugs directly into the lungs.  The Novartis pill works in a very precise way to block the action of inflammatory cells called eosinophils.  The latest research, published in the journal Lancet Respiratory Medicine, comes at a time of considerable innovation in asthma care, with the recent launch of new injectable drugs for severe asthma that also target eosinophils.  At the same time, many drugmakers are developing improved asthma inhalers, including “smart” devices with sensors that monitor use.	0
"Could Worms In Your Gut Cure Your Allergies?  Enlarge this image toggle caption David Scharf/Science Source David Scharf/Science Source  When you first meet Moises Velasquez-Manoff, the first thing you notice is his hair — or the lack of it.  toggle caption NPR  He's completely bald.  ""At age 11, I developed this condition, called alopecia areata, where I lost my hair,"" says Velasquez-Manoff, a science writer in Berkeley, Calif. ""It started in patches, but eventually I lost it all.""  A few years ago Velasquez-Manoff was working on a book about autoimmune diseases, like allergies, asthma, Crohn's disease and alopecia. He talked to many people who were using an unlikely tool to treat their problems: parasitic worms that live in your gut — permanently.  The worms were getting rave reviews. ""People were saying, 'I had absolutely zero symptoms. And my disease went into remission!'"" Velasquez-Manoff says.  So he started to wonder: Could these worms cure his alopecia? Maybe his hay fever, too?  Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Moises Velasquez-Manoff Courtesy of Moises Velasquez-Manoff  He went down to Mexico, bought 30 hookworms and let the larvae infect him.  Hookworm larvae are microscopic. But they have little spikes that puncture the skin and allow the larvae to burrow inside you. Then the critters head straight for a capillary.  ""They basically ride your bloodstream back through your heart, into your lungs,"" where they hang out for a while, Velasquez-Manoff says.  Then the larvae crawl out of the lung through your stomach and into the small intestine — where they bite onto the intestinal wall and start sucking blood — a few drops a day.  At that point, the worms do something amazing: They suppress the immune system, says P'ng Loke, an immunologist at the New York University School of Medicine.  ""That's the really fascinating thing,"" he says. You see, the worms don't shut down the immune system completely — just enough so that the immune cells won't attack the worm.  But this can help with something else. It can keep the immune system from getting out of control and attacking the body.  ""If you think about it, the worst thing that you want is an immune system that's out of control,"" Loke says.  Why? Because that's when you get autoimmune problems. So the hypothesis is that intestinal worms could possibly reverse these problems, by damping down the immune system.  The idea was so promising, that back in 2011 a pharmaceutical company decided to test it in clinical trials. Coronado Biosciences put together about six large studies.  The first study to finish was a big one in Europe that looked to see if pig whipworms helped with Crohn's disease.  The bottom line: ""The proportion of patients who improved with the worms was no different than the proportion of patients who were improved with placebo,"" says Dr. Stephen Hanauer at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, who was involved with one trial.  The whipworms were so ineffective at stopping Crohn's disease that Coronado canceled its other trials. The company's stock plummeted. And eventually the company changed its name and focus.  Other trials with worms haven't gone so well either, says Hanauer. ""The controlled trials, thus far, in a variety of different diseases including childhood allergies and asthma have not been positive.""  It's unclear why the worms haven't worked in these trials, Loke says. It could be that the whipworm larvae weren't prepared correctly. Or that the worms work for some people but not others. It may depend on a person's genes.  Back in Berkeley, Velasquez-Manoff thought he might one of the lucky ones.  A little while after he took the hookworms, his hay fever disappeared.  ""Like just gone, gone, gone,"" he says.  And his hair?  ""Then I had like, little bit of peach fuzzy hair growing here and there on my body,"" Velasquez-Manoff says.  But then the tide turned. ""Suddenly it's like one day, the whole thing reversed.""  His hay fever came back. The hair didn't grow anymore.  And having worms in his body wasn't pleasant. At first, he had diarrhea and cramps. That got better. But even months later, he still felt kind of bad.  ""I never got back to feeling completely normal for that year [that the worms were inside],"" Velasquez-Manoff says.  He says the benefits of the worms definitely didn't outweigh the bad side effects. And he would never try treating his alopecia or hay fever with them again.  ""The way I thought of it was, would I give this to my kids? And the answer is pretty easily and obviously: Hell no,"" Velasquez-Manoff says. ""I wouldn't want them to feel this way."""	0
"By Dennis Thompson  HealthDay Reporter  MONDAY, Dec. 7, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Evidence is mounting that a marijuana-derived oil might benefit some children with epilepsy whose seizures aren't controlled by approved medications, two new studies show.  Cannabidiol (CBD) significantly reduced seizures in as many as half of children with epilepsy, researchers planned to report Monday at the American Epilepsy Society's annual meeting, in Philadelphia.  But experts say these positive findings may have been influenced by a ""placebo effect."" All participants in these studies knew they were taking the oil, which could have affected reports of its effectiveness.  ""We know that our placebo rates can be as high as 30 percent, and sometimes higher,"" said Dr. Amy Brooks-Kayal, American Epilepsy Society president, who wasn't involved in the studies.  ""We don't know the real effect of the cannabidiol, and we won't until we complete the studies that are ongoing that are placebo-controlled and blinded,"" added Brooks-Kayal, who is also a professor of pediatrics, neurology and pharmaceutical sciences at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.  There also are concerns that cannabidiol may interact badly with some anti-seizure medications approved for epilepsy treatment, according to another study scheduled for presentation at the meeting.  Cannabidiol is a major chemical component of marijuana, said Dr. Orrin Devinsky, a neurologist at NYU Langone Medical Center's Comprehensive Epilepsy Center in New York City and co-author of one of the studies.  CBD doesn't produce intoxication like pot's other major chemical compound, THC. But, researchers believe it may interact with a brain receptor that plays a role in the development of seizures, Devinsky said.  ""This receptor has several effects, but one of them may be to modulate the calcium inside and outside the neuron, which is very much related to the excitability of nerve cells,"" he explained.  Previous studies have shown some benefit in adults, and word has spread. Families with adults and children with epilepsy have flocked to states where medical marijuana is legal to seek treatment, Brooks-Kayal said.  ""There is a fairly active and vocal group of families in Colorado who are using cannabidiol oils that are made artisanally,"" she said.  To see whether children with epilepsy would benefit from cannabidiol treatment, Devinsky led a study involving 261 people, mostly children, whose seizures had not been controlled using current anti-seizure medications. The average age of the participants was 11.  Everyone received a British-made cannabidiol oil called Epidiolex, which was administered as a drop on the tongue, Devinsky said. This was in addition to their current drug therapy.  After three months, seizure frequency declined by an average 45 percent in all participants. Almost half experienced a 50 percent or greater reduction in seizures, and about one of every 10 patients became seizure-free, the study found.  ""This was a very, very treatment-resistant group, and the response was very promising,"" Devinsky said.  A second study from the University of California, San Francisco, explored the long-term effectiveness of cannabidiol for children with epilepsy, by adding the marijuana-derived oil to the regular drug regimen of about 25 kids for one year.  The study found that after a year, the treatment resulted in a 50 percent reduction in seizures for 10 participants -- about 40 percent of the group. One child remained seizure-free, but 12 of the initial participants dropped out of the study because the cannabidiol didn't seem to do them any good.  Although he said he would prescribe CBD to people with uncontrolled seizures, Devinsky said he is ""very anxious"" to see the results of ongoing randomized, controlled clinical trials. The results of one major trial are expected in the first quarter of 2016, he added.  If CBD proves effective in controlled trials, it could be two to five years before the drug is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, Devinsky noted.  Federal regulators also will have to weigh potential interactions of cannabidiol with other anti-seizure drugs. Another study scheduled for presentation at the meeting found that CBD appeared to enhance the effects of the epilepsy medication levetiracetam (Keppra), when given to lab mice.  However, the oil appeared to interact negatively with two other drugs, clobazam (Onfi) and carbamazepine (Tegretol), the University of Utah researchers found.  Data and conclusions presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Blood injections, especially of platelet-rich blood, into the affected area help relieve the pain associated with “tennis elbow” where other treatment methods have failed, according to a Greek study.  A player returns the ball during the Monte Carlo Masters tennis tournament in Monaco April 13, 2009. REUTERS/Eric Gaillard  Analogous blood injections, in which the patient’s own blood is taken and then injected into a specific area of the body, is used to help harness the healing power of blood to treat the degeneration of tendons. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is blood that has been spun in a centrifuge to separate the blood cells.  “There is now a solution for patients suffering from unrelenting ‘tennis elbow,’” said Christos Thanasas from Henry Dunant Hospital, Athens, who led the study.  “Whole blood treatment is a god alternative in remote areas or in health systems that do not support financially the use of PRP,” he told Reuters Health in an email.  Thanasas and his colleagues compared the effectiveness of single local injections of PRP under ultrasound guidance with autologous blood injections in 28 patients with tennis elbow, formally known as lateral elbow epicondylitis.  Visual analog pain scores at 6 weeks after the injections improved by a mean 3.8 points or 61.47 percent in patients who had the PRP injections compared to the autologous blood group, a mean 2.5 points or 41.6 percent improvement.  Both groups experienced more improvement at 3 and 6 months after the injections, with no significant in pain scores between the treatments.  The findings were published in The American Journal of Sports Medicine.  “PRP is probably the best treatment for chronic refractory lateral epicondylitis if it is used after classical types of treatment like rest, braces, nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs, cortisone injections or physiotherapy have all failed,” Thanasas said.  The last resort remains surgery.  Thanasas added that further studies are needed to see how and when the PRP therapy is most effective, adding that he and his colleagues are about to start trials of PRP therapy in which different concentrations of white blood cells are used to see how this affects the regeneration of tendons.	0
The drug floods the brain with hormones and neurotransmitters that evoke feelings of trust and well-being, users report. Researchers say this allows patients to re-examine traumatic memories.  In follow-up psychotherapy, patients process emotions and insights brought up during the MDMA session. The current protocol calls for patients to take MDMA two or three times, each a month apart, interspersed with psychotherapy.  “The MDMA alone or the therapy alone don’t appear to be as effective,” Dr. Mithoefer said. “The MDMA seems to act as a catalyst that allows the healing to happen.”  What do patients say about it?  “I was actually able to forgive myself,” said Nigel McCourry, 36 a Marine veteran who was deployed in 2004 to Falluja, Iraq, whose experiences mirrored those of three other patients interviewed.  Mr. McCourry came home from war unable to escape scenes of an explosion that nearly killed him, and haunted by the memory of two young girls he accidentally killed in a fire fight. He struggled to sleep. He drank to forget. Rage eroded most of his relationships.  He tried help at a Veterans Affairs hospital, but couldn’t let his guard down enough to benefit from standard psychotherapy. A handful of medications meant to help left him feeling like a zombie, and he gave them up. He was contemplating suicide when he tried MDMA.  “When it kicked in, it was like an epiphany,” he said. “I could see all these things from combat I was afraid to look at before, and I had a totally new perspective. I relived the parts of me I had lost. I realized I had viewed myself as a monster, and I was able to start to have some compassion for myself. It was a turning point, and for the next year I continued to get better.”	0
"By Amanda Gardner  HealthDay Reporter  TUESDAY, Jan. 11, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Jane Adrian, 61, a landscape architect in Glendale, Calif., saw her parents and two co-workers suffer from the painful, blistering condition known as shingles, so when the vaccine became available, she got it.  Even though the vaccine is only about 55 percent effective, ""it's better than nothing,"" she said. ""Now I feel relieved.""  A study of a cross-section of adults enrolled with a health-management organization in southern California shows that the vaccine provides protection for many older adults without many side effects.  The findings are published in the Jan. 12 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.  Shingles is caused by the herpes zoster virus and only strikes people who have had chicken pox. It usually starts as a rash on one side of the face or body, often causing pain, itching and tingling. About a million cases occur in the United States each year, and attacks can last two to four weeks.  ""Even after the rash has healed, the pain can last for months or even years,"" said lead study author HungFu Tseng, a research scientist at the Kaiser Permanente Division of Research and Evaluation in Pasadena, Calif.  Zostavax, as the vaccine is called, was approved in 2006, based on the results of clinical trials. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends the shot for eligible people aged 60 and older.  Tseng's team wanted to test the vaccine's real-world performance, so they compared 75,761 vaccinated members of the Kaiser Permanente health plan to 227,283 members who elected not to have the shot. Kaiser funded the study.  In vaccinated individuals, the rate of shingles was 6.4 cases per 1,000 people in a year while it was twice that -- 13 per 1,000 -- in the unvaccinated population, the investigators found.  The vaccine also reduced the risk of ophthalmic herpes zoster (infection that affects the eye) by 63 percent and hospitalization by 65 percent.  Those who had been vaccinated were more likely to be white, female and in better overall health than the unvaccinated people, the researchers noted. Lack of awareness, concerns about effectiveness or safety, and cost may have kept some people from getting the shot, Tseng said.  ""People 60 and over can consider talking to their physician about the possibility of receiving the vaccine to reduce their risk, and the doctor can evaluate if they are eligible,"" said Tseng.  Patients with leukemia, lymphoma, HIV or an allergy to any ingredients in the vaccine are ineligible for the shot.  ""It does bolster our confidence that it's effective in the real world,"" said Dr. Bruce Hirsch, an attending physician in infectious diseases at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., who was not involved with the study.  But the vaccine can cost a couple of hundred dollars, he said, perhaps making it out of reach for those with limited resources.  Because shingles is not contagious and doesn't present a risk of death, Hirsch said he would recommend the flu vaccine and the pneumococcal vaccine over this one for uninsured patients who would have to pay out-of-pocket.  ""This study helps me in terms of advising patients and prioritizing,"" Hirsch added.  While less reliable than some childhood vaccines, which are usually 90 percent effective in preventing certain illnesses, the shingles vaccination is still worthwhile, said Dr. Ciro Sumaya, professor of health policy and management at Texas A&M Health Science Center School of Rural Public Health.  ""I think it's a very good vaccine, and it's a safe vaccine, but obviously there needs to be continuing surveillance of usage of the vaccine to make sure there are no adverse effects that are seen in one in a 100 million cases versus one in five or 10,000 people,"" said Sumaya, also a member of CDC's Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices.  For now, he advises getting it. ""It's protecting against a severe disease, particularly in elderly adults,"" he said, ""so the benefit, I think, is overwhelming that we should be using this because it's recommended.""

March 15, 2012 -- A new prescription gel may quickly treat a common precancerous skin condition called actinic keratosis, a new study shows.  The gel is derived from the sap of the Euphorbia peplus plant. This has long been used as a folk remedy for skin lesions.  The new findings are published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  Actinic keratoses are typically red, scaly skin lesions that can over time develop into a type of skin cancer. They can often be found on sun-exposed areas of the body such as the face, scalp, arms, and legs.  The new gel, Picato (ingenol mebutate), is applied once daily for two or three days, depending on the area being treated. Other available topical treatments must be used for several weeks, and often irritate the skin. Cryotherapy, or freezing the affected skin area, is also used but can sometimes leave a scar.  Because the new gel is only used for a few days, any irritation is usually short-lived. The short duration also makes people more likely to stay the course, another advantage, according to the study's authors.  “The shorter application period is what makes ingenol mebutate a breakthrough in the treatment of actinic keratosis,” researcher Mark Lebwohl, MD, says in a news release. He is a professor and chair of the department of dermatology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City.  The new study included 547 people with actinic keratoses on their face or scalp and 458 people with these lesions on their mid-section or arms and legs. Half got the new gel and the other half received an inactive placebo.  At the end of the two-month study, 42% of people in the first group and 34% of those in the second group who got the new gel showed complete clearance of their lesions. By contrast, only 4% and 5%, respectively, of the people who received the placebo had complete clearance.  The new study was funded by Picato manufacturer LEO Pharma.	1
"Dr. Terrence Boyadjis, a psychiatrist in West Chester, demonstrates the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation on staff member Jennifer Knapp. The treatment involves using magnetic impulses to stimulate portions of the brain that control mood.  A year and a half ago, Marie Duffy suffered from depression so debilitating that she could do nothing but cry.  She had no interest in life, and she would wake up some mornings screaming as if she were in a nightmare.  ""I figured that I would either spend the rest of my life in a living hell, or not have it - because I would see to it that I didn't have life anymore,"" she said.  She had been on prescribed medication for depression for years, which until this point had been mild to moderate, but it was clear that the pills were not working anymore.  And then she went to see Terrence Boyadjis, a psychiatrist in West Chester.  Boyadjis uses NeuroStar therapy, developed by Malvern-based Neuronetics, which aims magnetic pulses at the brain to stimulate nerve cells likely involved in controlling mood.  Studies show that the procedure, called Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), works better than sham treatments to reduce depression with few apparent side effects. The magnetic stimulation costs up to $10,500 for a six-week regimen of care, is not yet covered by insurance, and may not work for many patients.  The therapy, which carries a slight risk of seizures, is meant for patients with major treatment-resistant depression who do not respond to at least one medication. Still, the technology has enabled Neuronetics to get funding from Quaker BioVentures, a Philadelphia-based venture capital firm that invests in life-science companies.  Quaker's current $700 million in committed capital is funding innovative treatments across the region.  In Conshohocken, NuPathe has developed Zelrix, an active, single-use patch for the treatment of migraines as an alternative to oral drugs, which often have severe side effects, said chief executive officer Jane Hollingsworth. The company hopes to start selling the patch in 2012 if it gains FDA approval.  Tarsa Therapeutics, which is based in Philadelphia, is marketing an oral dosage of a drug called Calcitonin for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis.  Near Neuronetics in Malvern, TetraLogic Pharmaceuticals has been shrinking tumors with proteins, trying to avoid the killing of normal cells that occurs with most cancer treatments.  And in Bristol, NB Therapeutics says it believes it has solved the delivery problems for the drug Lamisil, used to treat onychomycosis, a fungal nail infection that affects 35 million people in the United States, CEO Frank McCaney said.  Quaker BioVentures is not the only firm investing here. Polaris Venture Partners and Pfizer, which both back early-stage life-science companies, have funded some of these firms, including TetraLogic and Neuronetics.  Polaris director Kevin Bitterman said the decision to invest $30 million in Neuronetics was based largely on the fact that this was a ""classic example of a team working in groundbreaking technology.""  Quaker BioVentures founding partner Sherrill Neff said his firm ""saw this as a huge opportunity where we could provide safer and more durable treatment in a market which has millions and millions of patients.""  The numbers are certainly significant. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 9 percent of U.S. adults have depression, including 3.4 percent with major depression.  At the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, John O'Reardon directs the Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Program. He also ran a Neuronetics-funded trial that helped the product gain FDA approval in 2008. Penn does not use Neuronetics' unit but does employ the technology, conducting more than 1,500 sessions per year, often on difficult cases. ""We've been pretty satisfied with the results,"" O'Reardon said. ""As a treatment, it has been very effective in major depression, which is where it has FDA approval.""  More than 4,000 patients have received NeuroStar treatment since its 2008 debut.  Neuronetics does not report sales figures or profits, and NeuroStar is its only product so far. Still, the company says its U.S. employees have risen from 30 to 130 in the last two years.  NeuroStar TMS Therapy uses the same technology as MRI machines, which have been widely used around the world.  Patients get five sessions a week for four to six weeks, and remain awake during the 37-minute session. The cost varies across the country, but is generally about $350 per session. Most patients undergo 20 to 30 sessions, putting the cost at between $7,000 and $10,500.  Psychiatrists themselves pay $70,000 for the system, and Neuronetics provides training and technical support. So far doctors are offering it in Bryn Mawr, Wayne, Huntingdon Valley, Philadelphia, Newtown Square, and Mount Laurel. A full list is at www.neuronetics.com  The new treatment is not a panacea.

Philip Gehrman, a Penn clinical psychologist who was senior author, said the study proves that rapid treatment of depression is possible. But more research is needed to figure out why sleep deprivation works. His team is now conducting its own study.

"En Español  By Serena Gordon  HealthDay Reporter  THURSDAY, April 14, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- In the latest research to test the concept of an artificial pancreas for the management of type 1 diabetes, British researchers report that they were able to improve blood sugar control and reduce the risk of dangerous low blood sugars overnight.  An analysis of pooled data showed that the overall time that plasma glucose levels were in target ""increased by a median 28 percent"" with the artificial pancreas, said the study's lead author Roman Hovorka, a principal research associate at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom.  Hovorka's team is one of several working to produce an effective artificial pancreas, also known as a closed loop system or closed loop delivery.  An artificial pancreas combines existing diabetes management technology -- insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors -- with a sophisticated computer algorithm that tells these devices what to do when blood sugar levels are rising or falling.  The closed loop insulin delivery system, for example, computes insulin doses and administers them according to glucose levels detected by a sensor. The hope is that an artificial pancreas will closely mimic the way the human pancreas normally releases insulin in response to food or stress.  An effective artificial pancreas has the potential to vastly improve the lives of people with type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. The autoimmune attack destroys so many beta cells that someone with type 1 diabetes can no longer produce the insulin the body needs.  Insulin is a hormone that's essential for the body to use sugar as fuel. Without replacement insulin, people with type 1 diabetes couldn't survive. But, replacing insulin isn't easy.  While too little insulin can be deadly, too much insulin can also cause serious problems, and in the worst case, coma and death. Replacing insulin is a delicate balancing act, requiring constant blood sugar monitoring.  Previous research suggests that in a 24-hour period, the average person with type 1 diabetes spends about 10 hours with blood sugar levels too high, and about an hour a day with blood sugar levels too low, according to Aaron Kowalski, assistant vice president for treatment therapies at the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.  The current study included 24 people with type 1 diabetes and challenged an artificial pancreas prototype in two different real-life scenarios. The first trial was meant to mimic a night of eating at home, while the second trial was designed to simulate an evening out, including drinking alcohol, which can unpredictably lower blood sugar levels.  For the eating-in portion of the randomized study, 12 of the study volunteers were assigned to consume a medium-sized meal (60 grams of carbohydrates) at 7 p.m., and then another half were placed on the artificial pancreas program during the night, while the other half maintained their standard insulin pump therapy. Several weeks later, the participants came back for another meal and switched overnight regimens.  The second arm of the trial simulated a meal out. The other 12 volunteers were given a larger meal (100 grams of carbohydrate) at 8:30 p.m., and were dispensed white wine along with their meal. As with the other trial, half were managed with the artificial pancreas while the others used conventional insulin pump therapy.  Both groups were monitored twice overnight in each study.  ""For the eating-in scenario, overnight closed loop delivery increased the time plasma glucose levels were in target by a median 15 percent,"" said Hovorka. For the eating out scenario, the average time good blood sugar control was increased was 28 percent on average. And, when combined, the average increase in blood sugar control was 22 percent, according to the study.  Of greater concern to most people with type 1 diabetes is the ability to avoid low blood sugars while they're sleeping. The study found no serious low blood sugar events after midnight. There were four instances of severe hypoglycemia, but the researchers attributed three of them to insulin administered prior to the start of the study in the evening.  Results were published online in the British Journal of Medicine on April 14.  Although an accompanying journal editorial noted that the artificial pancreas is still ""in its infancy,"" some experts were cheered by the findings.  ""This study is more good news, and we're seeing an evolution of more and more sophistication in this closed loop study,"" said Kowalski. ""What we're doing now is pressing these systems in real situations with the goal of getting to the next step of testing at home,"" he added.  Hovorka said his team is working on developing a home trial now, and hopes to begin home trials by the end of the year.  More information  Learn more about type 1 diabetes "	1
"En Español  By Steven Reinberg  HealthDay Reporter  TUESDAY, Dec. 29, 2009 (HealthDay News) -- Many older adults consume ginkgo biloba, hoping to keep their minds sharp, but a new study finds that the herbal product doesn't stave off cognitive decline.  ""Measuring the effect of ginkgo in a big trial in older people, we didn't see any effect of the drug on slowing down or delaying normal age-related changes of cognition,"" said lead researcher Dr. Steven T. DeKosky, vice president and dean of the University of Virginia School of Medicine in Charlottesville.  ""If you are older and thinking 'I'll try ginkgo to preserve brain health,' we have no evidence that it is useful,"" he said. ""I won't take it anymore.""  The report, published in the Dec. 23-30 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, supports the findings of earlier, smaller studies.  To test ginkgo's effect on cognitive decline, DeKosky's group looked at results from the ginkgo Evaluation of Memory study, which included 3,069 community-dwelling adults 72 to 96 years of age. The participants, who were generally healthy when the study began, either took 120 milligrams of ginkgo or placebo twice a day and were routinely tested for cognitive abilities.  Over more than six years of follow-up, the researchers found no evidence that ginkgo delayed or prevented normal declines in memory, language, attention, visuospatial abilities or executive functions, such as anticipating outcomes and adapting to changing situations and thinking abstractly.  These results remained the same regardless of sex, age, race or education, the researchers noted.  However, ginkgo was safe and no serious side effects were noted, DeKosky added. ""The good news is it appeared that it was fairly safe; the bad news was it didn't seem to do anything at least as far as trying to slow down the cognitive changes of aging.""  Earlier results from the same study found that ginkgo did not prevent or slow the development of Alzheimer's or other dementias, DeKosky said.  The American Botanical council took issue with the findings, however.  ""There are many significant limitations of this study,"" Mark Blumenthal, council founder and executive director said in a statement.  ""First, the data being published this week are drawn from a previous clinical trial which was not designed to determine the decline in cognition. Second, about 40 percent of the subjects dropped out over the six-year duration of the trial; the statistics reported in the study include the dropouts for which no final data are available,"" Blumenthal said. ""Further, the subjects in the study were not monitored for certain cognitive parameters until several years after the trial began, creating difficulty in determining accurately whether they experienced a decline in cognition or not. Also, the age of the subjects is quite advanced, at an average of 79 years at the beginning of the trial. This age group is not typical of the age of both healthy people and those with mild cognitive impairment who use ginkgo for improving mental performance.""  Another group, the Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN), which represents the dietary supplement industry, also had reservations about the study.  In a statement, Douglas MacKay, CRN's vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs, said that ""there is a large body of previously published evidence, as well as ongoing trials, which suggest that ginkgo biloba is effective for helping to improve cognitive impairment in older adults."" He added that, ""as a former practicing naturopathic doctor, I have had the benefit of working with patients and have seen firsthand how ginkgo biloba can be effective in improving cognitive function.""  Ginkgo biloba is believed to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that protect cell membranes and help govern the workings of the brain's chemical messengers, or neurotransmitters.  Dr. Lon S. Schneider, director of the state of California's Alzheimer's Disease Research and Clinical Center at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, said that these findings were ""straightforward and expected.""  No measurable effect from ginkgo is seen on cognition, Schneider said. ""Regardless of whether people say 'I take it and I feel better,' you just don't see an effect,"" he said.  Still, Schneider won't object if someone wants to try it. ""It is not in my position to deflate hope,"" he said. ""If someone really feels they need to take this and they need to try it, well go ahead and do it. But their expectations should be realistic, and if they don't experience anything, then they probably should stop.""

"When a couple is struggling to conceive, it's the woman who is usually the first — and often the only one — to be poked, prodded and analyzed, experts say. The burden of figuring out infertility is too often placed on the woman alone.    ""Unfortunately, the majority of society looks at infertility as a women's issue, but that's just not the case,"" said Brad Imler, American Pregnancy Association president.    Placed among dozens of pregnancy, ovulation and female fertility kits, an at-home sperm test that hit retail shelves in April could help change that mentality, experts said.    SpermCheck Fertility, which determines in minutes whether a man's sperm count is low, offers almost instant insight into one of the many aspects of male fertility. Although it's not a comprehensive evaluation and could give some consumers a false sense of security, the test does provide a starting point while drawing attention to male infertility as a legitimate health concern.    ""It may provide (an opportunity for) both physicians and couples to take a closer look at ways for men to step up to the plate and optimize their reproductive potential,"" said Dr. Robert Brannigan, urologist at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. ""I think anything that highlights the fact that men can have issues, that men do play a role in infertility, is important.""    Approximately 15 percent of U.S. couples of reproductive age who are trying to conceive face infertility issues, said Brannigan, an expert in male fertility.    Male infertility contributes to 50 percent of those cases, he said. Male infertility alone is the cause 30 percent of the time; a combination of male and female factors account for the other 20 percent.    SpermCheck Fertility is designed to help couples determine more quickly whether male infertility might be a problem for them, said Ray Lopez, CEO of SpermCheck, based in Charlottesville, Va. Many men put off having a semen analysis because they don't want to provide a sample in a doctor's office or lab, he said.    ""No one wants to go through the embarrassment of jumping in that room and looking at dirty magazines,"" Lopez said.    Giving men the opportunity to take a test in the privacy of their home helps get the process moving, he said.    Men tend to think they're perfectly healthy, especially when it comes to their sexuality, APA's Imler said. This test, which is noninvasive, could be wake-up call for some.    ""If there is a problem with him, it's identified a little quicker,"" Imler said. ""We love the idea of avoiding that heartache of that month to month struggle of trying to conceive without success.""    SpermCheck Fertility is the only FDA-approved home sperm test currently on the market and available in retail stores, Lopez said. The test costs about $40; the average cost of a semen analysis in a doctor's office is about $100.    At-home sperm tests are a fairly new idea, Imler said, but SpermCheck Fertility is not the first one. Four years ago an FDA-approved home test called Fertell, which is no longer for sale, offered an evaluation of both male and female fertility.    There are also several at-home sperm analysis kits available online. They each include a microscope and cost at least $80.    Although it's not the first ever at-home test, SpermCheck Fertility is the first one to use the lateral flow assay method, Lopez said. When the semen sample is applied to the test strip, the liquid works its way up the paper until it reaches the results window.    ""It's very, very similar to a pregnancy test,"" Lopez said. ""The concept behind our test is to keep it simple, user friendly.""    For Brittany Scott, a Cortland resident whose husband took the SpermCheck Fertility test, however, it seemed a little more complicated than a pregnancy test. Scott said she was surprised by the number of steps involved, although none were very difficult.    Scott, a ""mommy blogger"" who requested and received a free test to review, said she wanted her husband to take the test to see if a recent vasectomy had worked. The result showed that the father of four's sperm count was below the test's threshold.    ""It was blatantly negative. I was really glad that the test was not ambiguous at all,"" she said. ""There was no line I could mistake.""    Scott said she wished the test had been available when the couple was struggling to conceive their first child. After about 11 months of trying, she had pushed her husband to get a semen analysis from a doctor.    ""If this test had been around back then, he would have definitely been more willing to do it"" than the semen analysis, she said.    (Also available is a more sensitive product called SpermCheck Vasectomy, which indicates whether a man's sperm count is above or below 250,000 sperm per milliliter.)    SpermCheck Fertility tests were created after a scientist at the University of Virginia discovered a specific protein found only in the head of sperm, Lopez said. By detecting that pr"	0
"En Español  By Alan Mozes  HealthDay Reporter  MONDAY, April 11, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- A new oral medication for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) shows promise in slowing disease progression, limiting brain atrophy and reducing MS relapses, a recently completed two-year clinical trial demonstrates.  The findings concern the experimental drug laquinimod, and stem from work with over 1,100 MS patients at 139 medical facilities in 24 countries.  The study found that to date, the new drug appears to be both safe and well-tolerated. If the experimental medication is eventually approved for use, it would be only the second oral MS drug available to patients, alongside a number of long-standing injectable options.  ""The injectables aren't going to go away,"" commented Dr. Scott S. Zamvil, a professor of neurology and faculty member in the program in immunology at the University of California, San Francisco. ""We went 17 years with injectables before we got our first oral option, 'Gilenya', just last year. But there's a lot of excitement about this new option and these results, because even though the injectables are safe and effective in terms of convenience and patient compliance, oral drugs are much better than shots.""  ""And with the one oral option we have today, there has been a lot of concern over a possible risk for immune suppression and also an increased risk for cancer,"" added Zamvil, who was not a part of the current study team. ""That does not seem to be the case with this new drug. So this appears to be a significant advance forward.""  The current research was funded by Teva Pharmaceuticals, the maker of laquinimod.  The lead study author is Dr. Giancarlo Comi, director of the department of neurology and the Institute of Experimental Neurology at the Scientific Institute and University Vita-Salute San Raffaele in Milan, Italy. He is slated to present his team's findings this week in Honolulu at the American Academy of Neurology meeting.  In the two-year, double-blind Phase III trial, participants were randomly divided into two groups: those who were given a daily dose of laquinimod (0.6 milligrams) and those who were given a sugar-pill (placebo); neither the researchers nor the participants knew who received the medication or the placebo.  The annual rate of MS relapse was 23 percent lower in the laquinimod group compared with the placebo group.  In addition, disability progression was reduced by 36 percent and brain atrophy by 33 percent compared with those getting the sham treatment.  Adverse events, including serious events, were comparable to those in the placebo group, according to the researchers. The incidence of liver enzyme elevation was higher in patients treated with laquinimod, according to Comi, but he added that the elevations were temporary, reversible and did not lead to any signs of liver problems.  Laquinimod was not, however, tested against currently existing treatment alternatives, the authors stressed. The team added that the new medication appears to tackle MS by a different type of mechanism than other available options, and apparently works by curtailing the onset of permanent tissue damage while limiting acute inflammation.  ""Each of the medications we have has a different mechanism of action,"" explained Dr. Gary Birnbaum, director of the MS Treatment and Research Center at the Minneapolis Clinic of Neurology. ""And MS is probably not a single disease. So different medications may work better for some and not others, which is why this new drug could end up being an important addition to the armamentarium.""  ""However, we still need to have a head-to-head comparison with other drugs,"" cautioned Birnbaum, who was not part of the study team. ""This is not that. And it's also important to note that this is not a cure. It achieved a reduction in the annualized relapse rate, and people on this medication did not have as many attacks per year as people on a placebo. But a 23 percent reduction is not a cure. This didn't stop MS.""  ""But, this is extremely hopeful research,"" he added. And if it is approved, it'll be a valuable adjunct to the array of treatment options now available.""  Since the study is being presented at a medical meeting, it should be considered preliminary until the findings are published in a peer-reviewed journal.

"Brain Implant Restores Sense Of Touch To Paralyzed Man  Enlarge this image toggle caption UPMC/Pitt Health Sciences UPMC/Pitt Health Sciences  Twelve years ago, a car wreck took away Nathan Copeland's ability to control his hands or sense what his fingers were touching.  A few months ago, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center gave Copeland a new way to reach out and feel the world around him. It's a mind-controlled robotic arm that has pressure sensors in each fingertip that send signals directly to Copeland's brain.  The scientists published details of their work online Thursday in the journal Science Translational Medicine.  ""It's a really weird sensation,"" Copeland, now 30, says in a video made shortly after he first tried the system. ""Sometimes it feels, kind of, like electrical and sometimes it's more of a pressure."" But he also describes many of the sensations coming from his robotic hand as ""natural.""  When Copeland touches an object with the robotic hand, he can tell which finger the sensation is coming from and whether an object feels hard or soft, says Robert Gaunt, a bioengineer and assistant professor in the Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation at the University of Pittsburgh.  ""But we're really not at the point where we could, say, get him to feel the difference between silk and burlap,"" Gaunt says.  The success represents an advance that is ""absolutely critical in terms of making prosthetics useful,"" says Mike McLoughlin, an engineer at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.  McLoughlin is part of a team at Hopkins that developed the Modular Prosthetic Limb that Copeland is using. The research at both Hopkins and in Pittsburgh is supported by the government's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.  For several years now, people have been able to control robotic arms using thoughts alone. But they have relied entirely on vision to know whether the arm is going in the right direction or grasping an object with the proper amount of force.  That makes it very challenging to perform simple tasks like grasping a foam coffee cup without crushing it, McLoughlin says.  Sensing Touch Watch a blindfolded Nathan Copeland accurately sense which finger's being touched.  ""Without sensory feedback, somebody would have to actually have to look at the prosthetic, look at the cup, start to close the hand, (and) visually see the cup is starting to deform,"" he says.  Restoring Copeland's sense of touch was a painstaking process, but the Pittsburgh team knew it was possible.  ""His hand has been disconnected from his brain because of his spinal cord injury,"" Gaunt says. ""But the brain hasn't lost its ability to feel.""  So the team began looking for a way to send touch sensations directly to Copeland's brain. The first step was to monitor his brain activity using a technique called magnetoencephalography.  ""We were able to see the parts of his brain that became active when he was watching videos of a hand being touched,"" Gaunt says.  Next, the researchers placed tiny electrodes in Copeland's brain that could stimulate the areas corresponding to each finger. Then they waited for the brain to heal, as it adjusted to the presence of the electrodes.  It was several weeks before the team was able to send the first tiny pulse of electricity to Copeland's brain. ""When it finally happened, he just very calmly said, 'Yep, I felt it on my index finger,' "" Gaunt recalls. ""But in the background I was breathing a sigh of relief and other people were cheering.""  Of course, mind-controlled robots are still years away from consumer applications, McLoughlin says. At the moment, they are still too expensive, too bulky and too finicky to be used outside a laboratory setting. And there's no good way to control them without implanting electrodes in the brain.  Still, the ability to receive touch sensation from a robotic arm has the potential to help not only thousands of people who are paralyzed, but also people with a wide range of physical disabilities, McLoughlin says. For example, robots that provide sensory feedback could eventually help a disabled person cook a meal or clean up things at home.  ""We're on the verge of something here that's going to transform lives,"" he says."	0
The genetic legacy each of us inherits is a powerful force -- and in a few extreme cases, it can be deadly. Still, thanks to science, genetics need not always be destiny, as Martha Teichner shows us in our Cover Story:  Amy and Brad Price’s home in Omaha, Nebraska, is crazy with all the kids around. There are seven of them, ages 2 to 11. But if you look closely, you’ll see small memorials to one more: Liviana, who died in 2013 at the age of 5½ of a rare, nightmare disease called late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy. MLD destroys brain cells and is caused by a single, faulty gene.  “She was happy all the time,” Brad said.  Amy added, “She loved pretty dresses.”  “She loved her tutu,” Brad said.  She was talkative, addicted to “Caillou,” the animated TV series, a lively little girl, ‘til she was two. “Her knees were going a little knock-kneed,” Amy said. “And she had been just randomly falling down.”  Her doctor said, “Nothing to worry about,” but she quickly got worse.  “I was in the kitchen doing something and I heard her crying,” Amy recalled. “And I turned around and said, ‘Liviana, what’s wrong?’ And she said, ‘Mommy, my legs don’t work.’”  Liviana was diagnosed in the fall of 2010. Amy recalled: “She’s sitting on the bed in her tutu and her colorful sweater, and they’re telling me she’s gonna die.”  Many children with the disorder are dead by the age of 6. And it runs in families. If it hadn’t been for Liviana, Amy and Brad Price would never have known to have their other children tested. They learned that their infant son, Giovanni, had inherited the faulty gene, too.  “I get a call from the doctor’s office,” said Amy, “I knew. And I was thinking, ‘I’ve just been told two of my kids now are gonna die.’”  Except that’s not what happened.  Doing research online, Amy Price discovered the existence of a medical trial in Milan, Italy, of an extraordinary gene therapy treatment for MLD that would save Giovanni’s life -- and later, when his sister, Cecilia, was born with MLD, hers, too. The treatment works only on children who, like them, have not yet started showing symptoms.  The Price family scraped together the money to go to Milan.  “The patients go to the surgery room for collection of the stem cells on Monday, and receive their cells back on Friday evening,” said Dr. Alessandra Biffi, who oversaw the trial.  A patient’s stem cells contain the faulty gene, which the doctors have learned how to fix. Amazing, right? But then they need a vehicle to insert the good gene into the stem cells before those are put back into the patient’s body.  Here’s what’s really amazing: That vehicle is the HIV virus, re-engineered so the children can’t get AIDS.  Why the HIV virus? “Is it particularly efficient at getting around the body?” Teichner asked.  “Yeah, it’s very efficient in entering our cells, and that’s why we use it,” Dr. Biffi replied.  How well did the children do? It will take years to know for sure, but so far so good. “At least 70-80% of them have an outstanding benefit coming from the treatment,” Dr. Biffi said. “Some of the children were going to school and having a normal life.”  Giovanni Price is six now, in first grade. He and his sister Cecilia (Ceci for short) have to go back to Milan twice a year to be tested and monitored.  Brad Price calls Dr. Biffi “Our angel. She took us in like family.”  So why Italy, and not the United States?  Gene therapy has a checkered history. In the 1990s, hyped as the Next Big Thing, research withered here after serious setbacks, including a death during clinical trials. But more than 15 years later, it’s back. One sign: Dr. Biffi is now head of the gene therapy program at Dana-Farber/Boston Children’s Cancer and Blood Disorders Center.  Teichner asked, “Do you believe that gene therapy is finally coming into its own?”  “I think yes, absolutely,” Dr. Biffi replied.  The MLD trial, she thinks, demonstrates what’s possible -- offering promise to the 30 million Americans who suffer from some 7,000 rare diseases.  Trials for the experimental treatment Ceci and Giovanni Price received in Milan have not begun in the U.S. They are two of only 24 children in the world with MLD to receive it.  Compare Giovanni to Calliope Joy Carr, also six, from Bala Cynwyd, Pa., outside Philadelphia. She can turn her head, a little. She can still smile and laugh. But that’s about all. She was diagnosed at 2.  For her parents, college professors Patrick Carr and Maria Kefalis, coming to terms with the disease was wrenching. “It’s decline in slow motion, and that’s difficult,” said Carr.  “I remember the social worker said, ‘It’s good to try to cry in the shower to save it from your family and your children,’” Kefalis said.  After more than a year of rage and grief, Kefalis decided that she had to find some way of helping MLD children. It was too late for Cal, but she was desperate to give her daughter’s life meaning.  “We’re not wealthy people,” she said. “We didn’t know very influenti	1
"En Español  By Alan Mozes  HealthDay Reporter  SUNDAY, Aug. 29, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Most heart patients who take low-dose omega-3 fatty acid supplements don't appear to gain any additional protection against further cardiac trouble, new Dutch research cautions.  In fact, neither low doses of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), which are found in fish oil, nor of alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), derived from nuts and several vegetable oils, provided any benefit to the vast majority of heart patients, the study showed.  The scientists focused on patients who were already taking medications to control blood pressure, cholesterol and potential clotting. So, the researchers theorized that the poor performance of the supplements may simply reflect the overwhelming power of the medications.  Study author Daan Kromhout, from the division of human nutrition at Wageningen University in the Netherlands, is to present the findings Sunday at the European Society of Cardiology Congress in Stockholm; the study will appear online in the New England Journal of Medicine simultaneously.  In the study, researchers focused on a group of more than 4,800 Dutch heart attack patients between the ages of 60 and 80, slightly more than three-quarters of whom were men.  All had experienced a heart attack at some point in the decade leading up to the study, and all were taking blood pressure medications, anti-clotting drugs and statins.  At the study's start, the patients were instructed to consume (over a period lasting a little over three years) one of four different types of margarines: one supplemented with omega-3 fatty acids; one supplemented with the plant-derived ALA; one supplemented with both omega-3 fatty acids and ALA; and one with no supplements.  The amount of supplementation added to the various margarines was deemed to be ""low-dose."" During the study, the patients consumed an average of 18.8 grams of margarine per day, which meant ingestion of an average of 226 milligrams of EPA combined with 150 milligrams of DHA omega-3 fatty acids and/or 1.9 grams of ALA.  By the study's end, almost 14 percent of the heart attack patients had experienced another ""major cardiovascular event,"" with some cases ending in death.  None of the low-dose supplements seemed to stave off such events in most of the patients. One exception appeared to be among women ingesting ALA; researchers saw a 27 percent reduction in the risk for further cardiac complications, although that reduction did not quite reach statistical significance.  ""The bottom-line finding of the Alpha Omega Trial is that [omega]-3 fatty acids did not reduce the primary endpoint major cardiovascular events,"" Kromhout said, noting that the ALA finding needs further confirmation.  Dr. Murray A. Mittleman, director of the cardiovascular epidemiology research unit at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said he was ""not that surprised by these results.""  ""Other studies have shown no benefit from omega-3, other than specifically protecting against cardiac death linked to arrhythmia among patients who have just survived a heart attack,"" Mittleman noted. It is during this acute post-attack period, he explained, when patients are most vulnerable to a subsequent event.  ""But here, in some cases the patients they looked at are years following their first heart attack when they start taking these supplements,"" he stressed. ""So, that's a big difference in what kind of patient they're examining. And they're also not just looking at preventable fatalities but all heart-related events that follow. And on top of that, the supplement doses they use here are very low, much lower than those used in prior studies.""  ""So it might be big differences in study design that account for this new finding,"" Mittleman cautioned. ""In any case, I would say this is absolutely worth further investigation.""  Dr. Gregg C. Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, agreed.  ""It is possible that improvements in other treatments for heart attack patients have made fish oil supplementation less important for reducing cardiovascular risk,"" he acknowledged. ""But it's also possible that the different dosing used in this study relative to previous work made a difference in the outcome. The dosing here may have been just too low, whereas higher doses given immediately following an initial heart attack might have been protective.""  ""So I would say,"" Fonarow added, ""that this is by no means the final word regarding omega-3s and cardiovascular health.""

"En Español  SUNDAY, Oct. 24, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Bitter taste receptors are located in the lungs as well as on the tongue, a finding that might lead to improved treatments for asthma and other obstructive lung diseases, according to researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore.  ""The detection of functioning taste receptors on smooth muscle of the bronchus in the lungs was so unexpected that we were at first quite skeptical ourselves,"" said the study's senior author, Dr. Stephen B. Liggett, professor of medicine and physiology and director of the university's cardiopulmonary genomics program, in a university news release.  The receptors in the lungs -- which the team found by accident in an unrelated study -- are the same as those on the tongue. But the tongue's receptors are clustered in taste buds that send signals to the brain, while the receptors in the lungs are not grouped in buds and don't send signals to the brain, explained the research team. However, they still respond to bitter tastes.  The researchers tested different bitter compounds on human and mouse airways, individual airway smooth muscle cells, and on mice with asthma. They found that these compounds all opened lung airways more profoundly than current drugs.  The study appears online Oct. 24 in the journal Nature Medicine.  ""New drugs to treat asthma, emphysema or chronic bronchitis are needed. This could replace or enhance what is now in use, and represents a completely new approach,"" said Liggett.  But, he added, simply eating bitter-tasting foods or compounds won't help people with asthma.  ""Based on our research, we think that the best drugs would be chemical modifications of bitter compounds, which would be aerosolized and then inhaled into the lungs with an inhaler,"" he said.  The research, which is preliminary, was supported by grants from the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health.  More information  The U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute has more about asthma."	1
Genomic Health Inc. has struck a deal to commercialize a new blood test that can help advanced prostate cancer patients decide whether to try costly new-generation drugs or rely on much cheaper traditional chemotherapy to improve their chances for survival.  The test, developed by closely held Epic Sciences Inc., San Diego, detects a mutation associated with a poor response to two new drugs, Xtandi from Medivation Inc. and Astellas Pharma Inc. ALPMY -0.78% of Japan, and Zytiga from Johnson & Johnson.  The two blockbuster drugs have significantly extended survival for many patients with advanced prostate cancer. But in a study published last month, patients who tested positive for the anomaly—a variant of the androgen receptor called AR-V7—lived substantially longer if they were treated with chemotherapy than those given the two new drugs. The receptor is the target of the new drugs.  “If AR-V7 was present, the patients didn’t respond to the [new] agents,” said Howard Scher, chief of genitourinary oncology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York. “They progressed more quickly and they didn’t live as long” as those treated with chemo. Dr. Scher is lead author of the study, which was published online by the journal JAMA Oncology.  The findings suggest that patients with the variant can improve their survival chances while avoiding use of the more-costly therapies. Xtandi’s price is $9,370 a month while Zytiga’s is about $8,600. Docetaxel and cabazitaxel, the standard so-called taxane chemotherapies for advanced prostate cancer, cost several hundred dollars a month, researchers said.  “You get both improved clinical outcome and economic benefits to the health system,” said Murali Prahalad, Epic’s president and chief executive.  The retrospective study involved 161 men. Researchers said the test needs further validation in larger, prospective randomized trials. The companies believe the recent study, and previous research linking a poor response to the two drugs to the AR-V7 variant, are sufficient validation for clinical use, said Phil Febbo, Genomic Health’s chief medical officer. They plan to launch the test early next year while more rigorous studies are under way. The price hasn’t been determined.  The companies estimate that about 50,000 U.S. patients a year have advanced prostate cancer that has progressed after standard hormone therapy and would be candidates for the test as they and their doctors consider treatment with the new agents. Studies suggest as many as 20% may have the AR-V7 variant, or acquire it as their tumors change during courses of therapy.  The agreement bolsters Genomic Health’s portfolio of cancer diagnostic tests intended to help doctors tailor treatment based on the molecular traits of their patients’ tumors. Its OncotypeDX line of tests for breast, prostate and colon cancers gives patients with early-stage disease information on whether they’re likely to benefit from chemotherapy—or in the case of the prostate, other aggressive care—as part of their treatment. The new pact is part of Genomic Health’s plan to provide diagnostics to guide treatment for metastatic, or advanced disease.  The test is called a liquid biopsy because it analyzes blood instead of tumor tissue to determine if the mutation is present. It is based on technology that cannot only detect AR-V7 but also determine whether it is in the nucleus of individual tumor cells.  The presence of the AR-V7 in the nucleus is a key factor in whether patients respond to the new drugs, Dr. Scher said. In the study, no patient determined to have the variant in a single tumor cell’s nucleus responded to either Xtandi or Zytiga.  In the study, a positive test for AR-V7 didn’t assure patients would respond to the chemotherapy, nor did a negative test promise a response to the Xtandi or Zytiga.  Under the agreement, which covers commercializing the test in the U.S., Genomic Health is making an equity investment in Epic. Specific financial terms weren’t disclosed.  Qiagen NV of Germany and Tokai Pharmaceuticals Inc., Boston, are codeveloping an AR-V7 liquid biopsy test based on different technology as a diagnostic test for Tokai’s experimental prostate-cancer drug called galeterone intended to treat men who test positive for AR-V7.  Corrections & Amplifications:  The wholesale acquisition cost of the prostate cancer drug Xtandi, marketed by Astellas Pharma Inc. of Japan and Medivation Inc., is about $9,400 a month compared to about $8,600 for rival drug Zytiga from Johnson & Johnson. An earlier version of this article quoted Xtandi’s price as more than $10,000, using the average wholesale price, which is higher than the wholesale acquisition cost.

Men whose prostate cancer comes back after surgery are more likely to survive if, along with the usual radiation, they also take drugs to block male hormones.  The finding, published Wednesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, comes from a long-running study that experts say will help clarify treatment for many patients.  After surgery to remove the prostate, more than 30 percent of men have a recurrence, and until now there has not been clear evidence about the best way to stop the disease from killing them. Most are given radiation, but prescribing drugs to counter the effects of male hormones has been inconsistent.  The study, paid for by the National Cancer Institute, showed that among men who received radiation and hormonal treatment, 76.3 percent were still alive after 12 years, compared to 71.3 percent who had radiation alone.	0
"Oct. 28, 2010 -- A new, consumer-friendly test for colon cancer, once approved, could persuade more Americans to undergo screening for the deadly cancer, according to researchers presenting their findings on the test's effectiveness at a cancer conference in Philadelphia. At the same meeting, other researchers reported that they have new clues about how DNA characteristics can help predict colon cancer risk. The research was presented at the American Association for Cancer Research's special conference, Colorectal Cancer: Biology to Therapy.  Screening for Colon Cancer: Back Story ''One in every 17 of us will have colon cancer in our lifetime,"" says David Ahlquist, MD, professor of medicine and a consultant in gastroenterology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., who presented his findings on the new colon cancer screening test. Although colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death for men and women in the U.S., many adults don't undergo the screenings once they reach age 50 (or earlier for those with a family history), Ahlquist told a news conference. Estimates of how many adults undergo screening vary, but Ahlquist says probably only 40% adhere to the screening schedule over time. One screening test, the colonoscopy, in which a flexible, lighted tube with a video camera is inserted to examine the colon, requires dietary restriction and preparation of the colon. Patients must often take time off work and need transportation home from the procedure."	0

"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the first time ever has green-lighted a birth control app to be marketed as a method of contraception.  The app, Natural Cycles, calculates when a woman is most likely to be fertile using their daily body temperature data and their menstrual cycle information.  The app then tells users what days they are more likely to be fertile and should abstain from sex or use protection if they do not wish to get pregnant.  Natural Cycles  ""Consumers are increasingly using digital health technologies to inform their everyday health decisions, and this new app can provide an effective method of contraception if it’s used carefully and correctly,"" Dr. Terri Cornelison, the assistant director for the health of women in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a statement.  ""But women should know that no form of contraception works perfectly, so an unplanned pregnancy could still result from correct usage of this device,"" she added.  The app had a ""perfect use"" failure rate of 1.8 percent in clinical studies that involved more than 15,500 women, or a ""typical use"" failure rate of 6.5 percent, according to the FDA. The ""typical use"" failure rate took into account women who sometimes did not use the app correctly or may have had unprotected sex on a day when the app flagged that they were fertile.  STOCK PHOTO/Getty Images  Natural Cycles has, however, courted controversy in Europe, as some women have reported unwanted pregnancies while using the app as their main form of birth control.  Sweden's public broadcasting company SVT reported that 37 out of 668 women who received an abortion at a Stockholm hospital from September 2017 to the end of December 2017 were using the app and still had an unwanted pregnancy.  ABC News' chief medical correspondent Dr. Jennifer Ashton emphasized that no method of contraception is perfect except abstinence, so it's not completely surprising that women have still gotten pregnant while using it.  Ashton added that apps can be useful in that they enourage women to be aware of their bodies' monthly changes. If a woman does decide to use an app for birth control, however, she needs to have a plan for what she would do if she does have an unplanned pregnancy.  Most contraception pills have a ""typical use"" failure rate of approximately 9 percent, according to Ashton, which is actually higher than the rate of the app, the FDA's data showed.  Still, Asthon says that women should ask their doctors about risks, benefits and alternatives for any contraceptive method they are using."	0
"By Barbara Bronson Gray  HealthDay Reporter  FRIDAY, Feb. 8, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- For people with celiac disease, everyday foods such as bread, pizza crust and muffins are potential enemies. But scientists anticipate that some day a simple pill could help prevent the digestive upsets caused by ingesting the gluten in wheat, rye or barley products.  The only current treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet. A new study, however, offers some potential for hope. Researchers have re-engineered a naturally occurring enzyme, kumamolisin-As, to break down gluten in the stomach into much smaller protein pieces, called peptides. They say these are less likely to trigger the autoimmune response that can create a wide range of painful and irritating symptoms.  The re-engineered enzyme, named KumaMax, appears to be highly effective, at least in a test tube. It dismantled more than 95 percent of a gluten peptide that is thought to cause celiac disease, according to the study, which was published recently in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.  Ideally, the team could develop the enzyme into a food additive such as the gas remedies Beano or Gas-X and offer it without a prescription, said lead study author Justin Siegel, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of California, Davis. But this could take a few years to develop. If the researchers opt to make a prescription drug, the process of clinical trials and obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval could take a decade or more, he said.  An enzyme is a protein that performs a chemical reaction. Proteins are the workhorses in every cell of every living thing, and their function is defined by their shape and structure.  In this case, the researchers re-engineered the natural enzyme to recognize the peptide that triggers celiac disease and modified the protein in the laboratory so it would survive the acidic stomach environment. ""We did the engineering to change the genes and sent that into standard microorganisms to create the protein,"" Siegel said.  The next step is to show that the enzyme is not toxic and functions as designed in animals. ""It shouldn't be toxic; it's just a protein you're eating,"" Siegel said.  How effective might the enzyme be? ""For some people, even flour in the air makes them stop breathing. Some are very sensitive, and in some it just upsets their stomach a little,"" Siegel said. ""For those who are hypersensitive, this probably is not going to solve the problem, but it would allow them to go to dinner, and in case any gluten ended up in their meal, they wouldn't have to worry about it.""  ""For those less sensitive, they could pop one before each meal and eat anything they want,"" he added.  The process of identifying the precise trigger for a disease or condition and engineering a drug to circumvent the disease-causing process is part of what some call the personalized medicine revolution, Siegel said. ""We can design a small molecule, a pill, that can be specific to an exact target and have few side effects, if any,"" he said.  Some experts identified limitations to the research.  ""This is the earliest phase, and you now have to show that it actually breaks down the gluten peptides that trigger a response in the stomach at a speed that will protect the human,"" said Dr. Joseph Murray, a professor of medicine in the division of gastroenterology and the department of immunology at the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minn. ""Let's see how it goes with a whole slice of bread.""  Murray said that dismantling 95 percent of the protein component that is thought to trigger celiac disease may still not be enough to provide celiac patients protection. ""It will probably be helpful to someone who gets a low-level exposure [to glutens] by accident,"" he said.  But celiac disease is a common problem, with about 2 million to 3 million Americans suffering from it. ""People need alternatives, and this is an example of the scientific community taking novel approaches to helping people with celiac disease,"" Murray said.

Aug. 4, 2010 -- The plant extract resveratrol, found in the skin of red grapes, appears to suppress inflammation and may fight aging in humans, according to a new study.  Common food sources of resveratrol include grapes, wine, peanuts, blueberries, and cranberries.  Study author Husam Ghanim, PhD, of the University of Buffalo says the popular plant extract has been shown to prolong life and reduce the rate of aging in roundworms, fruit flies, and yeast, apparently because resveratrol affects a gene associated with longevity.  Now, Ghanim and colleagues say they have found that resveratrol reduces inflammation in humans that could lead to heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.  The researchers signed up 20 people and put them at random into two groups, one receiving a placebo and the other a supplement containing 40 milligrams of resveratrol. The volunteers took pills once a day for six weeks.  Fasting blood samples were taken at the start of the trial and then at intervals of one, three, and six weeks.  Results showed that resveratrol suppressed the generation of “free radicals” -- unstable molecules known to cause oxidative stress and release pro-inflammatory substances into the blood, resulting in damage to the blood vessel lining.  People taking resveratrol also showed suppression of the inflammatory protein tumor necrosis factor, or TNF, and other compounds that increase blood vessel inflammation and interfere with insulin action, causing insulin resistance and the risk of developing diabetes.  Blood samples from those on placebo showed no significant change in pro-inflammatory markers.	1
"Text Reminders Help People Lower Cholesterol, Blood Pressure  Enlarge this image toggle caption iStockphoto iStockphoto  Much of the buzz over mobile health interventions seems to be about how we can use an ever-growing variety of shiny new smartphone apps and sensors to better manage our health.  But texting, that old-school technology, may deserve some of that spotlight, too.  Getting texts with motivating and informative messages led patients with coronary heart disease to make behavior changes like exercising more and smoking less, according to a study published Tuesday in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association. By the end of the six-month study, patients who had received the text messages had reduced their cholesterol, blood pressure and body mass index.  ""I have to say, we were pretty surprised that it worked,"" says Clara Chow, lead author of the study and program director of community-based cardiac services at Westmead Hospital in Sydney, Australia.  And it worked to improve not just one risk factor for heart disease, but many. ""These are the things that medications usually do, not text messages,"" says Chow, who is also an associate professor at Sydney Medical School at the University of Sydney.  In a randomized clinical trial, more than 700 patients with coronary heart disease were split into two groups: half received four text messages per week for six months plus usual care, while the other half received just usual care.  The texts that patients received were semi-personalized, based on background information about each person, such as smoking status and preferred name. For example, vegetarian participants wouldn't receive the text message about how grilling steak is healthier than deep-frying it.  Other texts might include something like, ""Hi, Elizabeth. Have you gone for your walk today?"" or ""Have you taken your medications yet today? It's important to take them at the same time each day.""  There's a lot of hype over mobile health interventions these days, Chow says. ""Everyone thinks it has a lot of potential, but there's actually very little evidence.""  While there are more than 100,000 health-related apps on the market, the evidence to date is lacking as to whether many of those apps are safe or effective, according to Zubin Eapen, a cardiologist and assistant professor of medicine at Duke University School of Medicine.  ""We [as physicians] are always looking for evidence to make sure that we are recommending the right things for our patients, whether it's a drug, a device or a digital product, like an app,"" says Eapen, who is also medical director of the Duke Heart Failure Same-Day Access Clinic.  Eapen coauthored an editorial, which was published alongside Chow's study, with Eric Peterson, the Fred Cobb Distinguished Professor of Medicine in the division of cardiology at Duke and an associate editor of JAMA.  Not only does this research provide evidence that a text-based program can improve heart disease risk factors, but it also shows that a bunch of bells and whistles aren't required for successful health outcomes. A simple, low-cost program of text messaging can do the trick.  ""I like to look for things that are able to be used in multiple corners of our world, from low-income settings to high-income settings,"" Chow says. ""Everybody owns a mobile phone these days. You don't have to have a smartphone to text.""  That means more access across more sectors of a population. While almost two-thirds of American adults own a smartphone, that number rises even higher when you're talking about plain old cell phones – a full nine out of 10 American adults own some kind of cell phone.  Globally, cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death. ""If we are going to reach a global population, we need solutions that are both scalable and affordable,"" Eapen says. ""And mobile health – and text messaging, maybe, in particular – represents both a scalable and affordable approach.""  Making healthy changes in behavior can be tough, but for patients with heart disease, it can be vital.  Yet those daily decisions – whether to smoke that cigarette, eat that piece of cake or skip the gym – are often ""far removed from the rewards or consequences,"" Eapen says. It can be hard to view those everyday decisions in light of more distant consequences, like having another heart attack or not living as long a life as desired. Encouraging text messages may help to inform those everyday decisions and keep a bigger goal in mind.  Chow and Eapen say the study has its limitations. It can't tell us whether text messaging could eventually lead to fewer subsequent heart attacks among the patients receiving those messages or whether the positive health outcomes would continue past the six-month study window. Yet patients in Chow's study resoundingly said that the text messaging helped them make the necessary changes – more than 90 percent of the participants found the program useful.

"Researchers say they’ve developed a nasal spray that could potentially improve memory and other mental capabilities for the more than 5 million Americans suffering from Alzheimer’s disease.  In a pilot study at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, researchers studied 60 adults between the ages of 55 and 85 diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or mild to moderate Alzheimer's dementia (AD). Participants were nasally administered doses of man-made insulin called insulin detemir for 21 days.  ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT  The insulin detemir is designed to attach to album, a blood protein. Album absorbs the insulin detemir, distributing it throughout the body and allowing it to work. Because the insulin detemir dissolves from the protein slowly, it has a longer period of exposure in the body, lead study author Dr. Suzanne Craft, professor of gerontology and geriatric medicine at Wake Forest Baptist told FoxNews.com.  Participants who received 40 international unit (IU) doses of insulin detemir over the course of the trial showed significant improvement in their short-term ability to retain and process verbal and visual information, compared with those who received 20 IU doses or a placebo. According to Craft, performance on tests of mental manipulation and memory improved by as much as 25 percent.  Even recipients who carried the APOE-e4 gene – which is proven to increase Alzheimer's risk – showed significantly higher memory scores than those who received the lower dosage or placebo.  “Our team was surprised at the level of improvement for the participants with the gene that raises Alzheimer's risk, as very few types of therapies have been shown to benefit these patients,” Craft said.  Further research is needed to determine the mechanisms behind insulin detemir’s effect on memory.  The insulin detemir doses did not cause any negative side effects, and Craft said the study's overall results support further investigation of insulin detemir as a treatment for Alzheimer's and other neurodegenerative diseases.  Researchers hope to follow up on the pilot study in a larger group of participants who would receive the insulin detemir for a longer period of time. Additionally, Craft said they would also like to directly compare the insulin detemir to other forms of insulin to see which provides the most therapeutic benefit.  ""Alzheimer's is a devastating illness, for which even small therapeutic gains have the potential to improve quality of life and significantly reduce the overall burden for patients, families and society,"" she said. ""Future studies are warranted to examine the safety and efficacy of this promising treatment.""  Study results are published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease."	1
Dr. Neil M. Bressler of Johns Hopkins University, the chairman of the group that conducted the trial, said a two-line improvement in vision would allow some people to read normal-size print or to drive again.  Lucentis is not approved as a treatment for macular edema. But it is approved for another eye disease, age-related macular degeneration.  So doctors can — and some already do — use the drug off-label for the diabetic condition. With this successful Phase 3 trial, insurers will now be more likely to pay for such off-label use.  Some doctors criticized the organizers of the trial for testing Lucentis rather than another Genentech drug, Avastin, which works in the same way as Lucentis.  Although it is a cancer drug, Avastin is often used off-label for eye diseases because it is far cheaper than Lucentis, costing only $20 to $100 a dose, compared with $2,000 for Lucentis.  Avastin is undercutting sales of Lucentis, which totaled $1.1 billion in the United States last year.  Organizers of the trial conceded that a major reason Lucentis was chosen was that Genentech, which is now owned by Roche, agreed to provide the drug free of charge and to contribute $9 million in additional financing — but only if Lucentis were used.

But he said there were other factors as well, like a belief that Lucentis might have been the better drug.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Dr. Philip J. Rosenfeld, a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Miami, said the decision was “clearly a case of pay to play” since Genentech’s money dictated the choice of drugs.  Retinopathy results from damage to the blood vessels in the eye. In macular edema, fluid from those damaged vessels leaks into the macula, the part of the retina that is responsible for the straight-ahead vision important for driving, recognizing faces and reading.  Lucentis, also known as ranibizumab, works by drying up leaky blood vessels and preventing the growth of new ones.  John Bevan, who has diabetic macular edema, said that every two months or so he used to have an incident in which blood leaked into his eye, blurring his vision.  “It’s like a paintball hits a plate-glass window — there’s a big splat and it drips downward and takes three days to a week to dissipate,” said Mr. Bevan, the school superintendent in north central Indiana. He said treatment with Lucentis in the clinical trial virtually eliminated those incidents.  The trial involved 691 patients, some of whom had both eyes treated, resulting in 854 total eyes. There were four treatment groups: One group got Lucentis injections into the eye as often as every four weeks, plus laser therapy. Another got Lucentis, with laser therapy used only after six months and only if needed. The third group got laser therapy plus injections into the eye of triamcinolone, a steroid sold by Allergan under the name Trivaris. The fourth group got laser therapy plus a sham injection.  After the first year, only 3 to 4 percent of the eyes treated with Lucentis suffered a visual loss of two or more lines compared to 13 percent that got only laser therapy.  Researchers said the results seem to be holding up for the second year of the three-year trial.  About 1 percent of those getting Lucentis injections suffered an inflammation of the eye from an infection.  The steroid treatment did not improve eyesight more than laser therapy alone and caused side effects.

"Marilynn Marchione, AP  America's favorite dietary supplements, multivitamins, modestly lowered the risk for cancer in healthy male doctors who took them for more than a decade, the first large study to test these pills has found.  The result is a surprise because many studies of individual vitamins have found they don't help prevent chronic diseases and some have even caused problems.  In the new study, multivitamins cut the chance of developing cancer by 8%. That is less effective than a good diet, exercise and not smoking, each of which can lower cancer risk by 20% to 30%, cancer experts say.  Multivitamins also may have different results in women, younger men or people less healthy than those in this study.  ""It's a very mild effect and personally I'm not sure it's significant enough to recommend to anyone"" although it is promising, said Dr. Ernest Hawk, vice president of cancer prevention at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center and formerly of the National Cancer Institute.  ""At least this doesn't suggest a harm"" as some previous studies on single vitamins have, he said.  Hawk reviewed the study for the American Association for Cancer Research, which is meeting in Anaheim, Calif., where the study was to be presented on Wednesday. It also was published online in the Journal of the American Medical Association.  About one-third of U.S. adults and as many as half of those over 50 take them. They are marketed as a kind of insurance policy against bad eating. Yet no government agency recommends their routine use ""regardless of the quality of a person's diet,"" says a fact sheet from the federal Office of Dietary Supplements.  Some fads, such as the antioxidant craze over vitamins A and E and beta-carotene, backfired when studies found more health risk with those supplements, not less. Many of those were single vitamins in larger doses than the ""100% of daily value"" amounts that multivitamins typically contain.  Science on vitamins has been skimpy. Most studies have been observational — they look at groups of people who do and do not use vitamins, a method that can't give firm conclusions.  Dr. J. Michael Gaziano, of Brigham and Women's Hospital and VA Boston, led a stronger test. Nearly 15,000 male doctors who were 50 or older and free of cancer when the study started were given monthly packets of Centrum Silver or fake multivitamins without knowing which type they received.  After about 11 years, there were 2,669 new cancers, and some people had cancer more than once. For every 1,000 men per year in the study, there were 17 cancers among multivitamin users and more than 18 among those taking the placebo pills. That worked out to an 8% lower risk of developing cancer in the vitamin group.  Multivitamins made no difference in the risk of developing prostate cancer, which accounted for half of all cases. They lowered the risk of other cancers collectively by about 12%. There also was a trend toward fewer cancer deaths among multivitamin users, but the difference was so small it could have occurred by chance alone.  Side effects were fairly similar except for more rashes among vitamin users. The National Institutes of Health paid for most of the study. Pfizer Inc. supplied the pills and other companies supplied the packaging.  The main reason to take a multivitamin is to correct or prevent a deficiency, ""but there may be a modest benefit in reducing the risk of cancer in older men,"" Gaziano said.  Cancer experts said the results need to be confirmed by another study before recommending multivitamins to the public. These participants were healthier — only 4% smoked, for example.  For people who do want to take multivitamins, doctors suggest:  — Be aware that they are dietary supplements, which do not get the strict testing required of prescription medicines.  — Ask your doctor before taking any. Vitamin K can interfere with common heart medicines and blood thinners, and vitamins C and E can lower the effectiveness of some types of chemotherapy. For people having surgery, some vitamins affect bleeding and response to anesthesia.  — Current and former smokers should avoid multivitamins with lots of beta-carotene or vitamin A; two studies have tied them to increased risk of lung cancer."	0
The latest advances in Alzheimer’s disease involve people who don’t appear to show any signs of cognitive decline yet. Experts now believe that the biological processes behind the neurodegenerative condition begin years, if not decades, before memory problems and confusion become noticeable.  At the annual Alzheimer’s Association International Conference, researchers say they have found a series of substances in saliva that can distinguish between people who experience normal aging, those with mild cognitive dementia (MCI, which in some cases can lead to Alzheimer’s and in other cases not), and Alzheimer’s disease.  Presenting at the meeting, Shraddha Sapkota, a graduate student in neuroscience at University of Alberta, and her colleagues described how they carefully analyzed the saliva of a group of volunteers participating in an aging study. Some had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and some with MCI, while others did not have any neurological conditions. By comparing their saliva components, the scientists found that each of the three groups showed slightly different patterns of compounds, which could form the basis of a relatively easy and non-invasive way to determine which people are at higher risk of developing more serious degenerative brain conditions.  The results aren’t conclusive enough yet for doctors to start using them to distinguish people who are more likely to develop Alzheimer’s, but that’s the goal, says Sapkota. Ideally, for example, isolating those with MCI might help doctors to focus in on a group of patients who might be at higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s and therefore might need more intensive and regular testing.

"By Kathleen Doheny  HealthDay Reporter  WEDNESDAY, Sept. 21, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- New guidelines issued by three leading cancer organizations suggest that more breast cancer patients should consider radiation therapy after a mastectomy.  Overall, the guidelines say there's enough evidence to show radiation treatment after a mastectomy decreases the risk of breast cancer recurrence, and that even women with smaller tumors and three or fewer lymph nodes involved can benefit from the therapy.  ""The new guidelines say there is clear evidence that the benefit of [post-mastectomy radiation therapy] extends to women with limited lymph node involvement,"" said Dr. Stephen Edge. He is vice president for health care outcomes and policy at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, N.Y. Edge was co-chair of the panel that developed the new guidelines.  One radiation treatment expert welcomed the updated recommendations.  ""The guideline is timely,"" said Dr. Janna Andrews, an attending physician in radiation medicine at Norwell Health Cancer Institute, in Lake Success, N.Y. ""The field of post-mastectomy radiation is changing. It's always up for discussion now as to who needs [post-mastectomy radiation therapy].""  The new guidelines help clarify what used to be a gray area, Andrews explained. ""In the past, if a woman had a small tumor, less than 5 centimeters, and not more than three or four positive lymph nodes, many doctors would say she does not need [post-mastectomy radiation therapy],"" she said.  The guidelines don't offer a single formula for which patients need radiation therapy, Edge noted. But they do focus on the group of women for whom there is the most debate about the value of radiation.  ""There is a great deal of controversy about whether women with one, two or three lymph nodes [with cancer] have sufficient risk to warrant radiation,"" he said. ""For women with four or more lymph nodes involved, everyone would recommend radiation.""  The guidelines also strongly support input from all specialists who treat breast cancer in making the decision about radiation treatment. That typically includes the surgeon, radiation physician and an oncologist.  Doctors need to weigh the risks and benefits, Edge added. Side effects can include redness of the skin, swelling and skin breakdown severe enough to compromise future breast reconstruction, he explained.  Edge said that doctors need to consider patients individually. For instance, he explained, ''a woman 65 who has microscopic involvement in a single lymph node and an estrogen-receptor positive cancer would be very different from a 38-year-old who has three lymph nodes involved and so-called triple-negative breast cancer."" The younger woman, he said, would typically be advised to get radiation.  The older woman, because her risk is lower, should have a discussion with her doctor to decide if the benefit outweighs the risk, Edge noted.  Andrews said that one take-home message for patients is to expect the surgeon to have consulted with the radiation oncologist and others on her team. If a woman's doctor tells her she does not need radiation after a mastectomy, the woman should be told why and she should ask if the radiation oncologist weighed in on the decision.  Edge was a panel representative from the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which created the guidelines along with the American Society for Radiation Oncology and the Society of Surgical Oncology.  All three groups published the guidelines online this week in their respective journals: the Journal of Clinical Oncology, Practical Radiation Oncology and the Annals of Surgical Oncology.

"En Español  TUESDAY, Nov. 23, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Implantable devices designed to control heart rhythm and efficiency while preventing sudden death among heart failure patients are as effective at ensuring patient survival in real-world situations as they are in controlled study environments, new research suggests.  The finding is based on an analysis of nearly 186,000 patients outfitted with either an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), a cardiac resynchronization therapy device (CRT), or a defibrillator combined with a CRT device (a CRT-D).  The study authors noted that the observation is somewhat surprising, given that some of the patients not enrolled in structured studies have already experienced a cardiac event and are therefore prescribed such devices to prevent a recurrence.  This would suggest that real-world heart failure patients, as a whole, might be more vulnerable to fatal events than those tracked in a study setting.  ""I'm very encouraged that survival after defibrillator implant is as good as it is for as long as it is,"" co-author Dr. Leslie A. Saxon, chief of the division of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine in Los Angeles, said in a news release from the American Heart Association.  ""There's a lot of good news here,"" she added.  Saxon and her team reported their observations in the Nov. 22 online edition of Circulation.  Crunching the numbers, the authors determined that 92 percent of ICD patients survive one year out from device implantation. The same is true for 88 percent of CRT-D patients, they noted.  Five years out, those figures dipped to 68 percent for ICD patients and 54 percent for CRT-D patients.  Among those outfitted with CRT devices alone, one-year survival was pegged at 82 percent, while five-year survival came in at 48 percent, the investigators found.  The poorer prognosis for CRT-only patients was attributed to their older average age (76 years), and the fact that they may be relatively sicker overall. Patients today tend to receive CRT devices with defibrillators.  The study team also found that patients whose implants were monitored remotely, on a continual basis, by a health facility network were about half as likely to die as patients who only had intermittent in-person assessments.  Remote monitoring via telephone lines and online physician access is available for all ICD and CRT-D devices, the authors noted, and enrollment in such programs is typically free with a cardiologist's recommendation.  ""It's highly likely the reason these patients did better is that they were receiving earlier diagnoses, and they were also empowered to take charge of their own health care more,"" Saxon said. ""I don't think there's any reason not to put a patient on it.""  Dr. Eric N. Prystowsky, cardiologist and director of clinical electrophysiology at St. Vincent Medical Center in Indianapolis, said that the findings are ""good news,"" but cautioned against over-interpreting the data.  ""These are very basic facts, concerning simply who lived and died,"" he noted. ""So we don't really know what it all means, and it's inappropriate to suggest that we could, based only on this compilation of data.""  But, Prystowsky continued, ""this analysis does show two impressive things: one, that patients who are not super-selected for a trial do well with these devices from a mortality standpoint; and two, that patients who had home-monitoring had better outcomes.""  Prystowsky added, ""Now on the latter point, again, from this data we can't say exactly why that is. But at our facility we think it makes caring for a patient much easier. Physicians knowing things sooner will theoretically give a patient a better chance for quicker access to appropriate care. And that has to be good. So we think there's certainly no downside to remote monitoring and, wherever possible, it's reasonable to want to do this.""

(Reuters Health) - Complementary and alternative medicine options may help men manage premature ejaculation, according to a new review of existing research.  The improvements were small, and the studies were of varying quality, but preliminary evidence suggests that acupuncture, Chinese herbal medicine, Ayurvedic herbal medicine and a Korean topical cream may all have desirable effects, researchers conclude in the journal Sexual Medicine.  “There are a range of treatments available for premature ejaculation, including drug treatments, behavioral techniques and counseling, however, some men may not want to visit the doctor, take drugs long-term or be on a long wait list for counseling,” said lead author Katy Cooper of the University of Sheffield in the UK.  “It’s important to evaluate the evidence for other therapies,” she told Reuters Health by email. “To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to assess complementary and alternative medicine for premature ejaculation.”  According to the International Society for Sexual Medicine, premature ejaculation can be a lifelong problem, and this primary form of the problem is usually defined as ejaculation happening within one minute of initiating vaginal intercourse every time a man has ever had sex. A man’s “latency time” can also become reduced later in his sexual life, and this secondary form is usually defined as ejaculation within three minutes or less.  In the current study, researchers evaluated 10 randomized controlled trials that included comparisons either to another type of treatment or to a placebo, or dummy, treatment. Two studies were of acupuncture, five were of Chinese herbal medicine, one of Ayurvedic herbal medicine and two of Korean topical “severance secret” cream.  Together, the two acupuncture studies found that the treatment slightly increased intravaginal ejaculatory latency time (IELT) by about half a minute compared to placebo.  Chinese herbal medicine increased IELT by about two minutes, Ayurvedic herbal medicine increased IELT by nearly a minute and topical cream increased IELT by more than eight minutes.  In some instances, a combination of traditional and alternative options was the most effective. For example, Chinese medicine paired with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) increased IELT by two minutes longer than SSRIs alone and nearly three minutes longer than the Chinese medicine alone.  “There are no approved treatments for premature ejaculation,” said Donald Patrick, vice chair for research at the University of Washington in Seattle. “This is a common condition that has serious psychological effects on relationships,” said Patrick, who wasn’t involved in the study. “We need treatments to address it, and it should be treated with equal seriousness as erectile dysfunction.”  The prevalence of premature ejaculation is difficult to measure because of the differing definitions of the problem and some men’s reluctance to report it. Some studies suggest that between 20 and 30 percent of men report early ejaculation concerns, but the International Society for Sexual Medicine estimates that about 4 percent of men have a lifelong condition.  “Although it is not openly discussed in the media - at least not as much as erectile problems have been discussed in the post-Viagra era - numerous studies report men feel frustrated, depressed and anxious because of this problem,” said Ege Can Serefoglu of the Bagcilar Training and Research Hospital in Istanbul, Turkey.  The main limitation of the study is the underlying weakness of the studies evaluated. Bias was unclear in most of the studies, and only five used stopwatches to measure IELT, which is the “gold standard” for premature ejaculation studies, Patrick said.  In addition, the authors write, the studies are so different, it’s tough to draw conclusions about the different options. For example, the five Chinese medicine studies tested different substances, including Qilin pills, Yimusake and Uighur.  Some studies, but not all, discussed side effects such as gastrointestinal discomfort, dizziness, mild pain and decreased libido. When they were reported, the adverse effects were generally mild, the study team writes.  “Nowadays, I am encountering alternative medicine-obsessed patients more than I used to, and it doesn’t make sense to argue with them about the treatment they want,” Serefoglu told Reuters Health by email. “After all, the placebo is a well-known clinical phenomenon, and some of my patients report surprisingly favorable outcomes.”  SOURCE: bit.ly/2kCpsdv Sexual Medicine, online December 29, 2016.	0
"Oct. 18, 2010 -- An analysis of 22 studies involving about 2.5 million people shows a significant association between using cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins and a reduced risk for colorectal cancer.  The analysis shows there was a 12% reduction of colorectal cancer risk among statin users. Also, the longer patients used statin drugs, the greater their reduction in risk for colorectal cancer.  The findings are based on a review of 22 studies published through October 2009 and were presented at the American College of Gastroenterology's (ACG) 75th Annual Scientific meeting in San Antonio.  Study researcher N. Jewel Samadder, MD, MSc, from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, says the relationship between statin use and a reduction in risk for colorectal cancer was consistent across various study designs.  “This effect was largely consistent across study design with both case control and cohort studies showing a strong correlation,” he says in a news release. “The length of statin use, both greater than six months and greater than five years of use was associated with reduction in colorectal cancer risk.”  The group of statins that showed the greatest effect in reducing risk are classified as lipophilic: atorvastatin (Lipitor), fluvastatin (Lescol), lovastatin (Altocor, Altoprev, Mevacor), pitavastatin (Livalo), and simvastatin (Zocor),  Colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer in the U.S.; 102,900 new cases of colon cancer are diagnosed in men and women every year, and about 39,670 new cases of rectal cancer are diagnosed annually.  The relationship between statins and cancer is unclear, but other research exploring the impact of statins at the molecular level suggests that these cholesterol-lowering drugs may help control the development of tumor, as well as tumor growth.  “Observational studies have suggested that long-term use of statins is associated with reduced risk of several cancers, including breast, prostate, lung, pancreas and liver,” says Samadder in the news release. “Our findings suggest that randomized controlled trials designed to test the hypothesis that statins reduce the risk of colorectal cancer are warranted.”  This study was presented at a medical conference. The findings should be considered preliminary as they have not yet undergone the ""peer review"" process, in which outside experts scrutinize the data prior to publication in a medical journal."	1
"En Español  By Steven Reinberg  HealthDay Reporter  FRIDAY, Dec. 7, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Hot flashes, a common curse in menopause, can be especially bothersome after breast cancer. But a new study suggests an existing medication may help.  The drug is oxybutynin (Ditropan XL), long used to treat urinary incontinence.  The study found that women taking the medicine had an average of five fewer hot flashes a week, compared with three fewer among women taking a placebo.  ""Oxybutynin is an option that can control these symptoms and improve quality of life,"" said lead researcher Dr. Roberto Leon-Ferre, an assistant professor of oncology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.  There are a couple of reasons for severe hot flashes after breast cancer. Chemotherapy may induce early menopause, and drugs that reduce estrogen levels may make hot flashes worse, the research team noted.  Hormone replacement therapy, which is often recommended for menopausal symptoms, is generally not advised for breast cancer survivors. That's left women who can't take hormones at a disadvantage.  Oxybutynin blocks a substance in the brain, and one of its side effects is decreased sweating, Leon-Ferre noted.  ""Because of this, we can take advantage of the 'side effect' and decrease involuntary sweating associated with hot flashes, and decrease the hot flashes as well,"" he explained.  The drug could be game-changing for certain women, said Dr. Alice Police, regional director of breast surgery at Northwell Health Cancer Institute in Sleepy Hollow, N.Y.  ""This is a really important advance in survivorship and compassionate cancer care,"" added Police, who wasn't involved in the study.  Because oxybutynin is already available for other conditions, Leon-Ferre said doctors could prescribe it off-label.  However, he cautioned that its long-term effects aren't known. Drugs in this class -- called anticholinergics -- have been linked with mental decline, he said.  For example, the drugs may raise the risk for problems with short-term memory, reasoning and confusion, and may also hike the risk for dementia among older patients, studies indicate.  For the new study, Leon-Ferre and his colleagues randomly assigned 150 women who experienced at least 28 hot flashes a week to oxybutynin or a placebo.  Almost two-thirds were also taking drugs to prevent a return of breast cancer, either tamoxifen or an aromatase inhibitor.  The women were randomly assigned to one of three groups: low-dose oxybutynin twice a day for six weeks; low-dose oxybutynin for one week followed by an increased dose; or a placebo.  Both doses appeared to reduce hot flashes better than the placebo.  And oxybutynin doesn't interfere with the metabolism of tamoxifen, Leon-Ferre said, calling that an important consideration for breast cancer survivors.  Most insurance covers oxybutynin, and a month's supply can range from $21 to $42. With insurance, copays would be less, he added.  Side effects included constipation, mild diarrhea, dry mouth, dry eyes, episodes of confusion and difficulty urinating, the researchers found.  Women taking oxybutynin also reported improvement in work, social activities, leisure activities, sleep and overall quality of life.  These are vital issues, Police said. ""I will never forget the first time a patient said, 'Thank you for curing my breast cancer, but you ruined my life,' "" she said.  The patient said endocrine therapy had caused hot flashes so severe that she could not sleep. As a result, she was having trouble at work and in all other aspects of her life, Police recalled.  ""Her intimate relationship was also suffering, as nighttime had become a battleground between her and her internal temperature control,"" Police said.  The patient said she was willing to stop her hormone therapy and risk the return of breast cancer rather than live with her current symptoms, she said.  ""This study makes me hopeful that these patients may have a way out of their dilemma,"" Police said. ""Instead of just telling them they should be happy to be alive, we may be able to offer a reliable treatment for some of the debilitating side effects of our treatments for breast cancer.""  The research was scheduled to be presented Friday at the San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in Texas. Studies presented at meetings are usually considered preliminary until peer-reviewed for publication in a medical journal.

"Some doctors are raising concerns about a new cancer-treatment device that uses electrical jolts to zap tumors but that hasn't been through a large clinical trial to prove it's safe and effective in people.  The device, called NanoKnife, is currently being used in about 13 U.S. hospitals including Baptist Health Medical Center in Little Rock, Ark., University of Louisville, and Shands Hospital/University of Florida in Gainesville, Fla. Each machine costs as much as $300,000. Some of the hospitals are aggressively promoting the device in ads and media presentations. One radio ad by the University of Miami's Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center says NanoKnife offers ""real hope"" to patients with liver, lung or kidney cancer with ""almost no side effects.""  The NanoKnife has been tested on animals and a small number of human patients, says its manufacturer, AngioDynamics Inc. ANGO -0.63% of Queensbury, N.Y. ""We have not done randomized, controlled clinical trials, the so-called gold-standard studies,"" says company chief executive Jan Keltjens. ""We think this is a very promising technology for treating cancer that is otherwise untreatable.""  Regarding the hospitals' ads, Mr. Keltjens says, ""We are not part of the whole PR machine. It's not something we are happy about."" He declined to elaborate.  The NanoKnife, which is also available in five hospitals outside the U.S., has so far been used to treat about 300 cancer patients world-wide. Doctors who have used the device say it has saved lives, including among prostate-cancer patients. While complications from the treatment have been reported in a few patients, some doctors say they are mainly concerned about what isn't known about the device because of a lack of evidence.  Hospitals in the U.S. and overseas are touting a new tumor-zapping medical device for cancer patients called the NanoKnife. The device uses jolts of electricity to remove cancerous tumors, but it's effectiveness has never really been proven, WSJ's Tom Burton reports.  ""There is growing concern in the interventional oncology community [that the NanoKnife] is being widely adopted prior to having gone through the necessary rigors of controlled investigations and clinical trials,"" says Riad Salem, chief of interventional oncology at Chicago's Northwestern Memorial Hospital. Northwestern doesn't have a NanoKnife, he says.  The NanoKnife's journey from testing in animals to being promoted as a cancer fighter highlights a shortcut the Food and Drug Administration allows for granting regulatory approval to certain medical devices. When a device is deemed similar enough to another already on the market, it can get approved with little or no clinical evidence.  The shortcut has been around since 1976 when Congress enacted it to encourage innovation in the industry and to get improved products quickly to market. But in an August report, an FDA panel recommended that the regulation be tightened by requiring manufacturers to provide more safety data on new devices and more detail about the connection between new and previously approved devices. Manufacturers were given 60 days to comment.  Pride of Ownership Doctors who own their own CT and MRI machines tend to order more scans for patients than doctors who don't own such equipment, which can drive up the cost of care. Some examples of how much more Medicare paid for scans to doctors who own their own imaging machines: Condition Additional cost of imaging Strokes 55% higher Spine trauma 53% higher Congestive heart failure 104% higher Minor back disorders 59% higher Source: Medicare Payment Advisory Commission 2009 Report to Congress, based on Medicare data  Some products have had problems once on the market after receiving expedited FDA approval. Bausch & Lomb Inc.'s contact-lens solution Renu with MoistureLoc was removed from the world market in 2006 after being linked to cases of fungal eye infection that can cause blindness. And Medtronic Inc.'s Sprint Fidelis defibrillator wires were pulled from the market in 2007 after being linked to deaths. Bausch & Lomb had won regulatory approval through the same shortcut that applied to NanoKnife, while Medtronic benefited from a different but similar FDA provision allowing marketing without large clinical studies.  AdvaMed, the medical-device industry association, says products approved through FDA shortcuts ""have an extremely good overall record"" of safety, and that any regulatory changes ""should be directed toward device types where there have been demonstrated issues.""  The NanoKnife was approved in 2008 because it was shown capable of destroying tissue similar to other existing devices that are used in heart surgery. But the NanoKnife, which isn't really a knife, was put to work treating cancer, excising malignant tumors that are near arteries, airways or other vulnerable tissues and thus difficult to remove.

Hair-transplant surgery could become cheaper and more accessible with a new robot that plucks hair follicles from the back and sides of the head so they can be moved to the top and front of a balding pate.  It normally takes eight to nine hours to individually harvest, by hand, the 1,000 follicle clusters needed to build a full mane of hair, according to Dr. James Harris, director of the Hair Sciences Center of Colorado in Denver. Since the surgery is tricky and time-consuming, fewer than 10% of hair-restoration surgeons do it. Most simply remove a whole strip of scalp and separate out the follicles under a microscope. Strip surgery is painful and takes weeks or months to heal versus just a couple of days’ healing time and less scarring with individual follicular-unit extraction, Harris says.  The new ARTAS robot decides which follicles to collect and plucks them out as the doctor stands by to check its work. The surgeon can watch from the same room or via a remote monitor.  Harris says the time passes quickly as he watches the robot do its thing: “It’s certainly less tedious than doing it by hand. It allows me to think more about the other things I’m going to do with the patient.”  Advertisement  The robot halves the surgery time, Harris says, and surgeons can be trained in its use in a couple of days, rather than the two to three years it took him to perfect the by-hand operation.  Harris developed a blade for the drill tip that the machine uses to punch out follicles without damaging them and licensed it to Restoration Robotics Inc. of Mountain View, Calif., the company that makes ARTAS. His office is one of two that tested a prototype of the machine.  Harris was so impressed he became the first hair-restoration specialist to install the ARTAS robot, which was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration last year. He and his fellow testers have already put more than 350 heads under the machine’s care, with no complications, he says.  Since collecting follicles one by one directly from the scalp is so time-consuming and difficult, physicians that do it charge $5,000 to $10,000, Harris says. The robot cost $200,000, but because it saves him time, Harris offers patients a discount if they let ARTAS do the follicle extraction.  Advertisement  —Amber Dance	0
"Enlarge Feature Photo Service Eli Lilly and Company manufactures Evista (raloxifene hydrochloride), part of a class of drugs called selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). WHICH DRUG TO TAKE? WHICH DRUG TO TAKE? Gabriel Hortobagyi of Houston's M.D. Anderson Cancer Center says: • Younger women may choose tamoxifen; it prevents more cancers and hasn't been shown to cause endometrial cancer before menopause. It's also probably the best choice for postmenopausal women without a uterus. • Postmenopausal women may opt for raloxifene. It's safe and still offers a lot of protection. HEALTH REPORTER TWEETS HEALTH REPORTER TWEETS A common osteoporosis drug, raloxifene, reduces breast cancer risk by 38% in women at high risk for the disease, without causing the serious side effects of similar drugs, a new study shows. That suggests more high-risk women should consider taking raloxifene, also known as Evista, says Victor Vogel, main author of the study presented Monday at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Washington. READER FORUM: Living with Cancer BREAST PROBLEMS: Linked to teen girls' drinking EXPERTS: One-third of breast cancer cases avoidable ""It's not a cure ... but it's an important protection for women who are at very high risk,"" says Vogel, who followed nearly 20,000 high-risk, postmenopausal women for almost seven years. Both raloxifene and another drug, tamoxifen, are approved to prevent breast cancer in women at high risk. Few women take them for prevention, however, because of concerns about side effects. Tamoxifen reduces breast cancer by 50% but can also cause hot flashes and other symptoms. So about half of breast cancer patients, who often take it to prevent a relapse, stop the drug early, says study co-author Lawrence Wickerham of Allegheny General Hospital. Tamoxifen also doubles the risk of endometrial cancer, from about one in 1,000 women to about two in 1,000, according to the National Cancer Institute, so many doctors are cautious about prescribing it. Given these concerns, no more than 5% of high-risk women today ""even consider taking"" either drug, says Gabriel Hortobagyi of Houston's M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, who wasn't involved with the study but will participate in a panel discussion at the conference. ""The impact of these drugs is huge,"" he says. ""The only thing that reduces the risk as much is a bilateral mastectomy."" The new study — which shows that raloxifene doesn't substantially increase the risk of endometrial cancer — should put those concerns to rest, says co-author Patricia Ganz, who runs a clinic for high-risk women at the University of California-Los Angeles. ""We have two very effective agents for breast cancer prevention,"" Ganz says. ""If women were not so risk-averse, we might actually be able to reduce the risk of breast cancer in high-risk women."" A typical American woman has about a 12% chance of getting breast cancer in her lifetime. That risk rises to about 18% for a woman whose mother or sister has had the disease, and to 30% for a woman with a breast lesion called atypical hyperplasia, Ganz says.

"By Steven Reinberg  HealthDay Reporter  THURSDAY, Sept. 2, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental test that can diagnose tuberculosis in less than two hours, making only one doctor visit necessary before treatment starts, is being hailed as a potentially significant advance against a disease that kills nearly 2 million people annually, most of them in developing countries.  ""This is a very important discovery,"" said infectious disease expert Dr. Marc Siegel, an associate professor of medicine at New York University. ""This could be an important tool worldwide, and even here in the United States.""  The test, known as the ""Xpert MTB/RIF"" test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and resistance to rifampin (RIF), appears to be more than 97 percent accurate and is even able to diagnose drug-resistant TB, researchers said.  A report on the researchers' work was published in the Sept. 2 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Further trials of the new test are planned, the researchers said.  Current testing for tuberculosis (TB) involves looking at sputum (respiratory mucus) under a microscope. But Siegel said such testing, which has been in use for more than a century, isn't always accurate. It also can take weeks for results from a TB culture, and infections can be missed.  ""That [the existing test] is knives and bearskins compared to this"" new test, Siegel said. The one potential drawback to the new test would be the expense, he said, adding, ""The key question is what's it going to cost?""  For the study, a research team led by Dr. Catharina C. Boehme, of the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics in Geneva, Switzerland, used the Xpert MTB/RIF test on 1,730 patients suspected of having drug-sensitive or multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis. The patients were from Azerbaijan, India, Peru and South Africa.  The test diagnosed tuberculosis in 99.2 percent of the patients, the researchers found. It also detected TB in 72.5 percent of people with the disease who had not been diagnosed with the conventional microscopic exam.  ""The test that we developed finally makes it possible to detect TB in a single clinic visit,"" Dr. David Alland, chief of infectious diseases at the UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, said in a university news release.  ""The test also indicates rapidly whether difficult-to-treat, drug-resistant forms are present,"" he said.  The test was created by the California-based corporation Cepheid, which plans to seek U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for the test, which went on sale late last year in Europe.  The test costs about $63 in Europe, but the company has agreed to provide it for less than half that in poor countries, said John Bishop, Cepheid's chief executive officer, as quoted in a story by the Associated Press. The machine costs around $30,000, but would be priced under $20,000 in poor countries, he told the AP.  Tuberculosis is a chronic bacterial infection that's spread through the air and usually infects the lungs, although other organs of the body can be involved. Most people who are infected with tuberculosis bacterium (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) don't have symptoms, but some will develop the disease, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health.  Some 2 billion people -- one-third of the world's population -- are thought to be infected with tuberculosis bacteria. Though largely eliminated in developed countries, TB remains a leading killer of young adults worldwide. The World Health Organization estimates that 8 million people develop active TB each year and nearly 2 million die.

Publicity in recent years about emotional, cognitive, and memory problems in aging football and hockey players who suffered multiple concussions during their careers has raised the anxiety level around the topic. A lawsuit by thousands of NFL players who claim the league did not keep them well enough informed about the long-term risks of concussion - dementia is one of them - is based in Philadelphia and has raised even higher the profile of what doctors call mild traumatic brain injury.	0
LONDON (Reuters) - British liquid biopsy company Angle said its Parsortix blood test had beaten current methods in identifying ovarian cancer, a breakthough that could help women receive the best possible outcome from surgery.  Headline results from a study of 400 patients in Europe and the United States showed the test to detect cancerous cells in the bloodstream correctly identified cancer in up to 95 percent of cases, the company said.  The test will enable women with ovarian cancer to be referred to gynaecological surgeons who specialize in the care of women with ovarian cancer, while patients with a benign tumor will not have to travel to specialist centers.  Angle founder and chief executive Andrew Newland said the study had demonstrated the ability to correctly detect cancer, and importantly correctly detect the absence of cancer.  The test was nearly twice as successful in eliminating false-positives than current tests, he said.  It also had the potential to identify targets on the tumor that could be used to inform treatment strategies, he said.  “The vision is that a woman who has been diagnosed with having an abnormal pelvic mass will have a simple blood test and from that we will deduce whether or not she has cancer and if she does which drug would be most suitable for her,” he said.  The performance of the test would now be validated in another study designed to meet European CE Mark and US FDA regulatory requirements, he said.  Shares in Angle, which has a market cap of about 50 million pounds, rose 2.2 percent to 68 pence.	1
"TUESDAY, Nov. 1, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Multiple sclerosis patients may eventually benefit from a novel treatment that takes aim at the abnormal behavior of a specific type of immune cell, preliminary research suggests.  The errant behavior of the cells in question -- known as ""B cells"" -- is viewed as key to the development of this chronic and disabling nervous system disease, commonly called MS.  The new therapy's potential is only in the early stages of exploration, cautions an international study team comprised of researchers from the United States, Canada, Switzerland and the Netherlands, in the report published in the Nov. 1 online edition of The Lancet.  But initial indications suggest that the new antibody drug, called ocrelizumab, successfully targets these renegade cells with hopeful results: a significant reduction in disease-related inflammatory brain lesions.  ""Our findings show that ocrelizumab rapidly suppresses inflammatory activity,"" noted the study authors, led by Dr. Ludwig Kappos from the University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland, in a journal news release.  Describing the targeting of B cells as an ""innovative therapeutic approach,"" Kappos and his colleagues reported that in testing among 218 patients, the drug's impact on lesions was ""rapid and pronounced."" What's more, to date the treatment appears to be safe.  The study authors noted that MS is a progressively debilitating disease that attacks an individual's central nervous system, disrupting the normal brain, spinal cord and optic nerve function.  A classic characteristic of the disease is inflammation, which takes the form of brain lesions.  The immune system's T cells have long been implicated in disease progression, but the notion that B cells may also play a major role is relatively new.  With this new potential target in mind, researchers configured ocrelizumab to specifically focus on a protein (CD20) found on the surface of certain B cells.  To test the drug, Kappos and his team recruited patients aged 18 to 55 seeking MS treatment in 79 centers in 20 countries.  The patients were divided into four groups, treated with: a low dose of ocrelizumab (600 milligrams); a high dose of ocrelizumab (2,000 mg); a well-known MS inflammation treatment known as ""intramuscular interferon beta-1a""; or a sugar pill (placebo). After 24 weeks, some of the doses were adjusted.  The result: at week 24, all of the patients receiving either dose of ocrelizumab fared better in terms of lesion count than either the placebo or standard treatment groups.  The number of active lesions had dropped 89 percent more among the 600-mg group compared with those getting a placebo. Similarly, those in the 2,000-mg group experienced a 96 percent bigger drop in lesions. What's more, relapse rates were much lower among those taking the new drug, in contrast to those taking a placebo.  The investigators further noted that even eight months after treatment launch, no serious adverse effects were directly attributable to the new drug.  That said, Dr. Moses Rodriguez, a professor of neurology and immunology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., disputed the premise that ocrelizumab is shaping up as anything new and innovative.  ""In fact, there's nothing novel about this at all,"" he said. ""There is another drug, called rituximab, that's been in early trials for MS for years. And all this new drug is attempting to do is replicate the same that rituximab already does. And I see no major advantage of this drug versus that older drug. It's not better or worse. It's the same,"" Rodriguez noted.  ""So bottom-line, I would not sell this as a major breakthrough in MS,"" cautioned Rodriguez. ""It's not.""  Funding for the study was provided by F. Hoffmann-La Roche and Biogen Idec. Inc.  More information  For more on multiple sclerosis, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine."	1
Step inside the lounge at Evolved Science and you’ll find a cocktail menu unlike any you’ve ever seen.  The ritzy Manhattan medical office — which says it serves high-powered clients and celebrities — shakes and stirs up tailored IV infusions using a slurry of vitamins and amino acids. There’s a Jet Lag Eraser, for use after hopping off a long international flight, a Detoxification saline smoothie for “improving alertness and mental acuity,” and a Late Night Rescue cocktail to undo the effects of too many actual cocktails the night before.  The company claims liquid vitamins, minerals, and amino acids delivered straight to the bloodstream can protect users from getting a cold, boost athletic performance, “annihilate toxins,” and stave off headaches. “We put together the ideal combination for them to obtain the results they want: clearer skin, clearer mind, better hair, better nails,” said Dr. Erika Schwartz, who runs the clinic.  advertisement  And though the IV lends a medical air to the procedure, the infusions suffer from the same problem as many supplements taken orally — there isn’t any robust evidence to back up their health claims.  “Supplements don’t fix anything and they don’t prevent anything. It’s simple,” said Dr. Pete Miller, a clinician and nutrition researcher at Johns Hopkins.  The Evolved Science clinic in New York. Evolved Science  Vitamin IV infusions aren’t anything new. Celebrities from Simon Cowell and Rihanna to the Real Housewives have proclaimed their love for vitamin drips. They’re part of a huge — and wildly popular — supplement industry which goes largely unregulated. Supplement makers aren’t allowed to claim that their products can cure or treat a particular condition, but they are allowed to make sweeping claims that the products promote health.  The infusion treatments can be traced back to an intravenous supplement known as the Myers’ cocktail, a slurry of magnesium, calcium, B vitamins, and other products developed decades ago by a Baltimore physician. There is a published review on the use of Myers’ cocktail — but it’s just a collection of anecdotal evidence. The author, Dr. Alan Gaby, has long promoted the use of intravenous vitamins for a wide range of clinical conditions.  The research on injectable vitamins of any kind is thin and the results unimpressive. One study looked at injectable vitamins to treat asthma, but there was no placebo group to compare outcomes against. Two studies have examined intravenous vitamin use in fibromyalgia patients. One didn’t turn up any significant improvement in patients who received the infusions. The other — which was also missing a placebo group — involved just seven patients and showed only short-term improvement in symptoms.  Schwartz, though, said the supplements are completely safe.  “We’re doing it in a sterile environment, it’s administered by a nurse, and everything is sterile,” she said. “The only difference is it’s kind of a beautiful environment.”  Customers at Evolved Science shell out anywhere from $325 to $875 for an infusion. For first-time clients, Schwartz recommends weekly injections for the first month or so, and then a routine infusion once a month. Patients kick back in cream-colored chairs together while they’re hooked up to IVs in the “infusion lounge.”  “It doesn’t look like a doctor’s office. It’s very relaxed, not like a spa. But like a private club. It’s a SoHo house kind of thing,” said Schwartz, a former trauma surgeon.  But as for whether they’ll help a client prepare for an important presentation?  “There is not not substantial evidence that vitamin supplements have a large impact on cognitive function,” said Dr. Francine Grodstein, a public health researcher at Harvard who has studied the subject. A longitudinal study would be needed to back those claims with evidence, she added.  Still, the trend seems to be going strong. The I.V. Doc — an in-home vitamin infusion service — offers on-demand nutrient drips in places including Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago, and the Hamptons. In Las Vegas, hangover buses deliver pick-me-up infusions on the go.  And despite a lack of sound evidence, experts expect consumers to keep coming back for infusions.  “What drives the market is not the science,” said Miller. “In spite of that lack of evidence, there’s still a market for it.”	0
"www.chicagotribune.com/health/ct-x-0720-liquid-facelift-20110720,0,1517610.story  By Ed Finkel, Special to the Tribune  July 20, 2011  Advertisement  Demand for minimally invasive cosmetic procedures showed a three-digit increase over the last decade, with Botox leading the way for those seeking to look younger or better.    As of last month, would-be patients can consider a new product that uses their own collagen cells, which are multiplied in a lab to create an injectable substance that smoothes out facial features. Injections typically cost a fraction of surgery and require much less recuperation time.    ""It's taking hold. People are doing (injections) a lot more frequently,"" said John Bull, a plastic surgeon in Naperville. ""People that are looking for a modest improvement with less down time and no scars typically want to have this done. The best candidates are people with early signs of aging and volume loss.""    Laurette Agee, 51, who is general manager of a McDonald's in Aurora, was a patient of Bull's. More than four years after losing her husband of 26 years, Agee was ready to come out of her shell but noticed the aging process taking hold.    She did not warm to the idea of plastic surgery, so starting in February she began receiving different types of injections in her cheeks, lips and along the sides of her nostrils.    ""I catch men looking at me now in a different perspective. It makes me feel very good,"" Agee said. ""At my son's wrestling meets, other moms were like, 'Did you have something done, Laurette? You look so good.' I have no shame in saying, 'I did this, and this, and this.'""    In the last decade, minimally invasive procedures have skyrocketed in popularity, from 5.5 million performed in 2000 to 11.6 million in 2010 — a 110 percent increase, according to the American Society of Plastic Surgeons. The best-known and most commonly used, Botox, jumped 584 percent.    Cosmetic surgical procedures were done 18 percent less often in 2010 than in 2000, with considerably larger drops in facelifts (65 percent), forehead lifts (57 percent), eyelid surgery (36 percent), chin augmentation (55 percent) and nose reshaping (35 percent), the society reports.    The new product, called laViv and approved by the Federal Drug Administration in late June, is what Chicago plastic surgeon Julius Few describes as ""another tool in our chest."" It will take awhile to reach market and will be more expensive than other injectables, at least initially, Few said.    ""It's not going to be one of these things where people are going to put down their other options like Botox overnight,"" he said. ""As this continues to develop and is modified and enhanced as an application, hopefully it will approach a cost point similar to some of the other options and have a broader application. ... My experience, given past history, is that the concept of using a patient's own material and then enriching it is expensive.""    Thomas Mustoe, a plastic surgeon and professor of surgery at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, also expects laViv to be costly and expressed skepticism that it will necessarily work better than other nonsurgical options. He said the FDA approval indicates that the procedure is safe and can work, but patients should not necessarily conclude more.    ""This is certainly significant that you have approval,"" Mustoe said. ""It is going to be simple to inject. But what is unknown is whether it is going to turn out to be better than other fillers. We're still sorting out what is possible with a needle and an injection.""    Part of the reason for the popularity of injectables is the cost. Bull said they typically are no more than half the cost of surgery, which can run from $5,000 to $20,000, depending upon the areas of the face affected and technique used.    Few said some minimally invasive procedures can cost $3,000 or more. Botox is ""a third or less of that,"" he said, but needs to be redone every three to six months, while other products can last ""on the order of years."" Plastic surgeons have been combining regimens to ""get a result that is better than either (product) alone,"" he said.    Susan P., 57, a Chicago resident and executive assistant who asked that her last name not be used, has been seeing Few for about four years. He has injected Botox and Restylane around her eyes, the sides of her nose and her forehead, and she estimates she spends about $3,500 per year.    ""There's no giveaway that I'm doing anything, which is really appreciated,"" she said. ""The longer you do this, the less often you have to go. There's a cumulative effect.""    Agee estimates she spent a little less than $2,500 for a combination of Radiesse for her cheeks, Botox around her eyes and Juvederm for the sides of her nostrils. Though initially apprehensive about possible side effects, she said, she's more than willing to repeat it.    ""The process was a lot easier than what I anticipated,"" she said. She had worried: ""My God, what happens if "	1
About one in 20 men is estimated to have Peyronie’s, but figures are not precise because people with the condition tend not to discuss it publicly.  Although the company selling Xiaflex will be Auxilium Pharmaceuticals of Malvern, Pa., the F.D.A. approval was a belated triumph for the drug’s original developer, BioSpecifics Technologies of Lynbrook, N.Y., on Long Island. Founded in 1957, it struggled for decades to find uses for the product, almost going out of business before licensing the drug to Auxilium in 2004.  “It sort of proves to people that if you really believe in a drug you should never give up,” said Matthew Geller, a biotechnology investment banker who is a member of the BioSpecifics board.  Shares of BioSpecifics closed Monday at $27.61, up from $1 as recently as late 2006.  Some people treated with Xiaflex in clinical trials for the Dupuytren’s hand condition said it had made a big difference in their lives, and had allowed them to avoid painful surgery.  Photo  “When I looked down and saw my finger straightened out, I cried,” said Kenneth Nelson, 65, of Indianapolis. “It was to me just like a miracle.”  Xiaflex is an enzyme produced by a gangrene-causing bacterium, Clostridium histolyticum, which uses it to eat away the tissues of its victims. The enzyme, called collagenase, breaks down collagen, a major component of the body’s connective tissue that is found in skin, tendons, cartilage and other organs.  But collagenase by itself does not cause gangrene. And there are times doctors need to break down collagen, such as when an excess builds up in the hand or penis, causing Dupuytren’s and Peyronie’s. The ailments are named for French surgeons who described the conditions in the 18th and 19th centuries.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  The enzyme was first extracted from the bacteria around 1950 by Ines Mandl, a young biochemist at Columbia University. Edwin H. Wegman, a Long Island entrepreneur, learned about Dr. Mandl’s work and set up a company called Advance Biofactures, which later became BioSpecifics, to turn collagenase into a drug.  In 1965, the company won approval of an ointment containing collagenase for use in removing dead tissue from skin ulcers and burns. The ointment, sold by licensees under the name Santyl, was a modest success, but the company never truly prospered.  So in the 1970s the company began developing what it thought would be a bigger money-maker, an injectable collagenase. It tested that drug for numerous uses, including herniated disks. Finally, in the early 1990s, two professors of orthopedics at the nearby State University of New York at Stony Brook suggested using the drug for Dupuytren’s.  The professors, Dr. Lawrence C. Hurst and Marie A. Badalamente, injected the drug into the tails of rats, as a stand-in for human fingers. They found they could dissolve the collagen in tendons, making the tails floppy, without harming nearby nerves and arteries. Then they organized clinical trials in patients and got federal grants to help pay for the work. The professors and Stony Brook will share a royalty of one half of 1 percent of sales of Xiaflex for use in treating Dupuytren’s.

In desperation, Ed Wegman’s son Mark, a top computer scientist at I.B.M., called a childhood friend, Laurence Korn, who had been the chief executive of a successful biotechnology company now known as PDL BioPharma.  With Dr. Korn’s help, BioSpecifics licensed the drug to Auxilium in a matter of weeks, receiving $5 million initially.  Auxilium was interested because of Peyronie’s disease. It already was selling a gel for men with low testosterone and had learned from urologists about the need for better treatments for bent penises.  Photo  “From talking with surgeons and patients who have Peyronie’s, neither of them wants to do the surgery,” said Will Sargent, a spokesman for Auxilium.  Two years ago, the drug giant Pfizer, which sells the erectile dysfunction drug Viagra, licensed the European rights to Xiaflex from Auxilium for an initial payment of $75 million. BioSpecifics got $6.4 million of that amount and will receive 8.5 percent of additional payments of up to $410 million that Pfizer might make.

"En Español  By Maureen Salamon  HealthDay Reporter  MONDAY, Jan. 24, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Doctors administering deep brain stimulation to control a patient's severe pain report that they discovered the treatment consistently lowered the man's hard-to-control high blood pressure.  The finding introduces the possibility that deep brain stimulation -- a surgical implant that delivers electrical pulses to the brain -- might one day become a treatment for drug-resistant hypertension or lead to clues about the brain's role in regulating blood pressure.  The study is reported in the Jan. 25 print issue of the journal Neurology.  About 10 percent of high blood pressure cases either can't be controlled with medication or patients cannot tolerate them, study author Dr. Nikunj K. Patel, a neurosurgeon at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol, England, said in a journal news release.  According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, high blood pressure affects 30 percent of American adults. The condition raises the risk of heart attack and stroke.  ""It's a really interesting paper,"" said Dr. Nicholas D. Schiff, director of the Laboratory of Cognitive Neuromodulation at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center. ""I thought it was compelling, though single cases are always questionable"" to generalize.  In the case study, a 55-year-old man was implanted with a deep brain stimulator to treat severe pain stemming from a stroke. Although the patient was taking four drugs to control his high blood pressure, which was diagnosed at the time of his stroke, his blood pressure had remained high.  The man's blood pressure gradually decreased enough for him to stop taking all blood pressure medications, though the deep brain stimulation failed to control his pain long-term. When researchers tested turning off the stimulator after two years, the patient's blood pressure rose significantly.  The study adds to other recent research focused on neuromodulation, which harnesses the power of electrical impulses in the body for therapeutic benefit. Tactics being tested include renal nerve ablation, a procedure that emits low-power radiofrequency along the nerves next to the kidneys, interrupting signals that trigger high blood pressure.  ""In the general sense, neuromodulation for blood pressure is really going to be a revolutionary treatment for chronic [high] blood pressure,"" said cardiologist Dr. Marc Penn, director of the Cleveland Clinic's Bakken Heart-Brain Center.  ""I think it's really interesting physiology,"" added Penn, noting that the results would need to be repeated multiple times before a therapy based on it could be developed.  Schiff, however, was hesitant to predict that deep brain stimulation might become a common treatment for hard-to-control high blood pressure.  ""This is a case report, and not a treatment for anything,"" he said, adding, ""There are risks to this procedure and one has to really look at the tradeoffs.""

* Bapineuzumab cuts amyloid plaque by 25 pct in small study  * Encouraging result after clinical trial setback in 2008  * Drug being developed by Pfizer, Elan and Johnson & Johnson  By Ben Hirschler  LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - New imaging technology suggests an experimental drug for Alzheimer’s reduces clumps of plaque in the brain by around 25 percent, lifting hopes for a medicine that disappointed in clinical tests two years ago.  Bapineuzumab — being developed by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), Irish drugmaker Elan Corp ELN.I and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) — is a potential game-changer because it could be the first drug to treat the underlying cause of the degenerative brain disease.  Investor confidence in the antibody medicine, however, took a big hit in July 2008 when it failed to meet its main goal in a mid-stage trial and caused brain swelling at higher doses. The new study, which only involved 28 patients, is modest fillip.  “It demonstrated that the drug has an effect on the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease,” lead researcher Juha Rinne from Finland’s University of Turku told Reuters.  Rinne and colleagues used a novel imaging substance called carbon-11-labelled Pittsburgh compound B, which sticks to areas of the brain where there is a lot of beta amyloid plaque.  After 78 weeks, they found that patients given bapineuzumab had about a 25 percent reduction in plaque compared with those on placebo. The effect was similar with three different doses of the drug, they reported in the journal Lancet Neurology.  The treatment was generally well tolerated, although two patients on the highest dose had transient brain swelling. The drug’s developers have since dropped the top dose from large ongoing Phase III trials.  Commenting on the results, Sam Gandy from New York’s Mount Sinai School of Medicine said it was too early to say effective disease-modifying drugs were at hand, but the ability to measure plaque in living subjects was “something of a breakthrough”.  Experts are divided on the root cause of Alzheimer’s and hence the best way to tackle it.  Most advanced drugs, like bapineuzumab, have focused on removing clumps of amyloid plaques, which are thought to stop brain cells from functioning properly. But a rival school blames toxic tangles caused by an abnormal build-up of the protein tau.  Rinne’s imaging study was funded by Elan and Wyeth, which is now part of Pfizer.

"Before the introduction of whooping cough vaccine in the 1940s, more than 200,000 cases a year were reported in the U.S. By 1965, that number plummeted to fewer than 10,000 a year. But the disease made a comeback in the 1990s, as the newer ""acellular"" vaccine — containing only cellular material but not whole cells — was phased in. While it is safer and has fewer side effects than the old version, studies have found that its protective effects wane more quickly than originally expected."	0
"Vitamin B and its role in improving memory Studies show a B vitamin cocktail may stave off cognitive decline. Nutrition lab  Anyone looking for an easy way to boost brain power is likely to come across an increasingly common piece of advice: Up your intake of B vitamins.  Forgot where you left your keys? The name of your neighbor's kid? Whether you locked the car?  The vitamins — including folic acid and vitamins B6 and B12 — are often touted as a way to improve memory and stave off cognitive decline. The claims are based on the finding that levels of the vitamin are low in people with various forms of cognitive impairment, including dementia and Alzheimer's disease.  But experts say it's still unclear whether taking high doses of the vitamins will keep such conditions at bay.  ""I don't know that people need to rush out and buy B vitamins — I don't think we're ready [for that] yet,"" says Mary Haan, an epidemiology professor at UC San Francisco who has studied the relationship between B vitamin intake and cognitive function in elderly adults.  Researchers believe B vitamins may affect brain health because of their ability to lower blood levels of an amino acid called homocysteine. In the 1990s, several studies documented high levels of homocysteine in people with cognitive impairment and dementia. But at the time, scientists didn't know whether high levels of the amino acid caused cognitive decline or whether cognitive decline caused people to accumulate high levels of the amino acid.  To determine which came first, researchers at Boston University followed approximately 1,100 healthy adults who were enrolled in the ongoing Framingham Heart Study, which began in 1948 to identify risk factors for heart disease. At the end of eight years, the researchers found that the rates of dementia and Alzheimer's disease were higher in people who had had high homocysteine levels compared with those who had low levels. Their conclusions — that high homocysteine levels increase a person's risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease — were published in the New England Journal of Medicine in 2002.  Since then, a handful of studies have administered high doses of homocysteine-lowering B vitamins to subjects in order to determine the vitamins' effects on brain function. The results have so far been mixed, with only a minority of studies showing a benefit, says Joshua Miller, a professor of pathology and laboratory medicine at UC Davis who studies the vitamins."	0
Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant could help treat certain form of multiple sclerosis, say doctors in Sheffield  A treatment traditionally used on patients with certain cancers is being tried on a small number of people with multiple sclerosis with “remarkable results”, according to a professor involved in the research.  The treatment destroys patients’ faulty immune systems through chemotherapy and then rebuilds them using stem cells previously harvested from their blood.  Doctors at Royal Hallamshire hospital in Sheffield stress that the treatment, so far given to about 20 patients over three years, is not suitable for everyone with the disease, which attacks nerves in the brain and spinal column.  The hospital is part of an international trial also involving patients in the US, Sweden and Brazil to see whether the treatment can benefit those with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, a form that involves flare-ups of symptoms such as loss of vision, fatigue, muscle problems and difficulties with balance that can last from a few days to a few months.  These will be followed by periods where symptoms are mild or disappear altogether.  Multiple sclerosis experts call for end to 'wait and see' approach to treatment Read more  Most people with MS – there are thought to be more than 100,000 in the UK – are diagnosed with this form, and although drugs may help slow progression, there is currently no cure.  Consultant hematologist John Snowden said: “The immune system is being reset or rebooted back to a time point before it caused MS ... The treatment has traditionally been used to treat bone and blood cancers.”  Basil Sharrack, a consultant neurologist at Sheffield teaching hospitals NHS foundation trust, said: “The new treatment is showing some remarkable results in the small number of patients we have treated so far.  “It is important to stress, however, that this treatment is only suitable for patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis disease who have had two or more significant relapses in the past 12 months, failed to respond to standard drug treatment and who have had the illness for at least 10 years.”  One patient who has undergone the treatment, known as autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), told the BBC’s Panorama programme that he had made incredible progress.  Steven Storey, who was diagnosed with MS in 2013, said: “I went from running marathons to needing 24-hour acute care. At one point, I couldn’t even hold a spoon and feed myself.”  Within a few days of the transplant, he was able to move his toes, and after four months could stand unaided, although he still needs a wheelchair. “It’s been incredible,” Storey said. “I was in a dire place, but now I can swim and cycle and I am determined to walk.”  Holly Drewry was 21 when she was diagnosed with MS, and her condition deteriorated after she gave birth to her daughter, Isla. “Within a couple of months I got worse and worse,” she said. “I couldn’t dress or wash myself; I didn’t even have the strength to carry my daughter.”  She had needed a wheelchair before her transplant, but after the treatment she walked out of hospital. Drewry, whose MS is described by doctors as “dormant”, said: “It’s been a miracle. I got my life and my independence back and the future is bright again in terms of being a mum and doing everything with Isla.”  Two years after the treatment, she has had no relapses and there was no evidence of active disease on her scans.  Paul Kirkham, another patient who has undergone the treatment at a cost of about £30,000, said: “It does knock you out. I’d rather have done 10 rounds with Mike Tyson.”  Richard Burt of Northwestern University in Chicago, who carried out the first HSCT for MS in 1995 and is coordinating the international trials, told the BBC: “There has been resistance to this in the pharma[ceutical] and academic world. This is not a technology you can patent and we have achieved this without industry backing.”  Emma Gray, the head of clinical trials at the MS Society, said: “Ongoing research suggests stem cell treatments such as HSCT could offer hope, and it’s clear that in the cases highlighted by Panorama, they’ve had a life-changing impact.  “However, trials have found that while HSCT may be able to stabilise or improve disability in some people with MS, it may not be effective for all types of the condition.  “We want people to be aware that HSCT is an aggressive treatment that comes with significant risks. It needs to be carried out at an accredited centre or as part of a clinical trial.  “The MS Society has recently funded a study looking into the impact of HSCT on the immune system and we’d like to see larger trials in this area. They would help us learn more about the safety and long term effectiveness of the treatment and who could benefit from it.”	1
NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - The inexpensive tests that look for hidden blood in a person’s stool are effective for colon cancer screening, a study out Tuesday confirms.  The findings, reported in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, give some extra weight to fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) as a valid option for early detection of colon cancer.  Experts generally recommend that people at average risk of colon cancer start screening tests for the disease at age 50. And they can pick from a number of tests that have all been found to cut the risk of dying from colon cancer.  Along with stool tests — done once a year at home — the choices include two invasive procedures: colonoscopy done every 10 years and flexible sigmoidoscopy done every five years.  The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federally supported expert panel, recommends that people at average risk of colon cancer choose any of the three methods.  FOBT detects hidden blood in the stool, which can be a sign of colon cancer or pre-cancerous growths called polyps. Positive results on the screen prompt a follow-up colonoscopy to investigate the source of the blood.  Advances in the stool tests in recent years have made them more effective. A newer version called immunochemical FOBT (iFOBT) is supposed to zero in on colon growths better than an older version known as guaiac FOBT — which often picked up bleeding originating in the upper digestive tract, such as from a stomach ulcer.  Immunochemical FOBT is now largely replacing the older test. But there’s been surprisingly little evidence that it really is highly “specific” to colon cancer, according to Dr. Yi-Chia Lee of National Taiwan University Hospital, one of the researchers on the new study.  So for their study, the researchers followed nearly 2,800 adults who all volunteered to have iFOBT, a colonoscopy and an upper endoscopy to check for problems in the upper digestive tract.  They found that of 28 people confirmed to have colon tumors after a colonoscopy, all but one had also a positive iFOBT result.  “It means that almost every case with colon cancer can be identified by iFOBT,” Lee told Reuters Health in an email. “It is a strong support to iFOBT as an effective screening tool.”  The researchers also found that iFOBT had “specificity” for colon cancer of close to 90 percent, meaning the test would accurately give a negative result to almost 90 percent of people who did not have colon cancer.  Of three study participants who were found to have cancers of the stomach or esophagus, for instance, none had a positive result on the iFOBT test.  Like any screening test, iFOBT does have a risk of false-positive results, which leads to unnecessary invasive testing in some people. In this study, about 10 percent of all participants had a false-positive finding on the stool test.  Among the risk factors for false-positives the authors identified were the use of anticlotting drugs and low levels of the iron-rich molecule hemoglobin in the blood.  In practice, a positive iFOBT result would be followed by colonoscopy, in which a scope is used to investigate the interior of the colon.  Whether used for first-line screening or as a follow-up, colonoscopy has the advantage of allowing doctors to spot and remove pre-cancerous growths called polyps — which means the test can prevent cases of colon cancer.  But as far as cutting the risk of death from colon cancer, stool testing is similarly effective, according to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force.  And it’s much cheaper: iFOBT is more expensive than the older stool tests, but it is still roughly $30. A screening colonoscopy averages around $3,000.  The downside of iFOBT being specific to colon tumors is that it is not useful for catching cancers of the stomach or throat.  That’s particularly important in Asia, where those cancers are common.  Lee said researchers there are looking into whether combining iFOBT with the older guaiac test is useful for catching cancers in the lower and upper digestive tract — and whether adding a third stool test, which looks for the ulcer-causing bacteria H. pylori, can help as well. Infection with H. pylori is associated with increased risks of stomach and throat cancers.  In the U.S., cancers of the upper digestive tract are relatively uncommon. The average American has a one in 200 chance of developing esophageal cancer, while the risk of stomach cancer is one in 114.  In contrast, Americans’ lifetime risk of colon cancer is about one in 19, according to the American Cancer Society. More than 50,000 Americans died of the disease in 2010.

Diseases like Alzheimer’s start years, even decades, before the first symptoms of memory loss shows up. And with rates of those diseases rising, experts say that more primary care physicians—not neurology experts—will have the task of identifying these patients early so they can take advantage of whatever early interventions might be available.  “If we had a simple blood test, a cholesterol test for Alzheimer’s disease, that would help,” says Dr. Ronald Petersen, director of the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center at the Mayo Clinic, “but we don’t.” But Petersen has a potential solution, and according to a new paper released Wednesday in the journal Neurology, his Alzheimer’s test has promise.  Petersen and his team wanted to develop a test that any physician can administer to patients, without the need for any new technology or expensive equipment. Petersen believes that the test they came up with could become a useful tool for any physician, even those without special training in the brain. “What we are trying to do is give them some help so they can be as efficient as possible without ignoring these important cognitive issues,” he says.  In the first phase of the test, his researchers simply collected information from 1,500 patients’ medical charts—their age, family history of Alzheimer’s, factors such as diabetes or smoking that have been linked to Alzheimer’s, and whether the patient had ever reported problems with memory.  In the next phase they studied the results of the patient’s basic mental exam as well as of a psychiatric evaluation, because depression and anxiety have been connected to Alzheimer’s.  And another factor that emerged as important in developing the disease—how quickly the participant could walk a short distance. “We were a little surprised,” says Petersen. “But what’s nice about it is that it’s a nice non-cognitive, motor factor so it’s looking at another aspect of brain function.”  MORE: This Alzheimer’s Breakthrough Could Be a Game Changer  Petersen suggests that every physician should get this information on their patients at age 65; that way, they can have a baseline against which to compare any changes as their patients age. Only if they show such changes — a slower walk, for example, or worsening signs of depression or memory issues — should they move on to the third phase of the test, which is a blood analysis. That would look for known genetic factors linked to Alzheimer’s, including the presence of certain versions of the ApoE gene.  Currently, the only way to truly separate out those on the road to Alzheimer’s is to conduct expensive imaging tests of the brain, or to do a spinal tap, an invasive procedure that extracts spinal fluid for signs of the amyloid protein that builds up in the disease. “We have either expensive techniques or invasive techniques and it’s not practical to do them from a public health screening standpoint,” says Petersen.

"En Español  By Denise Mann  HealthDay Reporter  TUESDAY, Nov. 15, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- An apple a day won't necessarily keep the doctor away, but three kiwis just might help, at least according to a small study that showed that the brown, fuzzy fruit may lower blood pressure levels.  Men and women with mildly high blood pressure who ate three kiwi fruits a day for eight weeks had systolic blood pressure levels that were 3.6 millimeters of mercury lower than those of volunteers who ate an apple a day. Systolic blood pressure is the upper number in a blood pressure measurement.  Kiwis may be small, but they pack a lot of nutrition in their green flesh. They are rich in lutein, a potent antioxidant, and this may be what is responsible for their blood pressure-lowering powers, said researchers who were led by Mette Svendsen of Oslo University Hospital in Norway. The study was to be presented Tuesday at the American Heart Association's annual meeting in Orlando, Fla.  Cardiologists were quick to caution that there is no single magic food or ingredient that is the key to heart health, but they all agreed that kiwi may have a place in the five daily servings of fruit and vegetables that are currently recommended as part of a heart-healthy diet.  The new study included 50 men and 68 women with an average age of 55 who were randomly assigned to eat three kiwis or one apple a day for eight weeks. Participants had blood pressure levels in the mildly elevated range of 128/85 when the study began. A blood pressure reading that is less than 120/80 is considered ideal. They changed nothing in their diet other than adding the fruit. Researchers measured blood pressure via 24-hour ambulatory monitoring, which is thought to be more precise than measuring it during a single point in time.  The Oslo University Hospital funded the study.  ""Three kiwi a day improved 24-hour blood pressure more than an apple a day,"" the researchers concluded.  So, is kiwi the new ""wonder"" fruit?  ""There is biological plausibility, but I would not go and grab three kiwis a day,"" said Dr. Nehal Mehta, a preventive cardiologist at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. ""They are not easy to find or one of those fruits that people readily grab.""  Moderation is the key with kiwis or any food, he said. ""Three kiwis a day or 21 kiwis a week does not seem like moderation, and I would caution against eating that much,"" he said.  The new study may just ""put kiwis on the map,"" he said. ""When we say 'eat more fresh fruit,' we stick to the tried-and-true or anything that is handheld and peeled, but these findings suggest that a kiwi can be part of a heart-healthy diet,"" he said.  In addition, the study looked at the whole fruit, not individual nutrients. Don't start popping lutein in supplement form based on these results, he noted.  Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a preventive cardiologist with Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, agreed. ""Kiwi is not the wonder fruit, but certainly adding kiwi to your diet can help decrease mildly high blood pressure levels.""  Dr. Elliott M. Antman, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said that while promising, the new study is small. ""Don't count on this to be the complete answer to high blood pressure,"" he said. Whatever you do, ""do not stop taking your blood pressure medications without talking to your doctor,"" he added.  Because this study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

"Enlarge By Robert Deutsch, USA TODAY Dr. Steven H. Weitz, a cardiologist at Ellis Hospital in Schenectady, N.Y., reviews data in his lab. SEARCH FACILITIES NEAR YOU SEARCH FACILITIES NEAR YOU A cholesterol drug so powerful that some researchers believe it could become the best weapon yet against heart disease has passed a critical test of its safety, researchers said Wednesday. The drug, Merck's anacetrapib, is the most promising in a new class of drugs designed to clear dangerous cholesterol from the arteries. Unlike statins, leading drugs that block the production of artery-clogging bad cholesterol (or LDL), the new drugs boost levels of good cholesterol (HDL), which acts as a kind of dump truck and hauls LDL away. An 18-month study of anacetrapib in 1,623 heart disease patients found that the drug had an ""unprecedented"" impact on both forms of cholesterol, lowering LDL by 40% and raising HDL by 138%, in patients who were already taking statins, says lead investigator Christopher Cannon, of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. ""If this pans out,"" Cannon says, ""it may turn back the clock on heart disease and push it off the top of the list as the leading killer."" Doctors caution that anacetrapib is experimental and must be tested in a bigger trial designed to show whether it actually prevents heart attacks and saves lives. If the drug succeeds, it will be at least five years before it can be sold in the U.S. ""I'm encouraged; there's no other way to look at it,"" says Steven Nissen, chief of cardiology at the Cleveland Clinic. ""But will this drug reduce deaths, heart attacks and stroke? We don't know."" The new study, released at an American Heart Association meeting and online in the New England Journal of Medicine, carried some early indications, though they're far from conclusive, Cannon says. Only eight patients taking the drug needed bypass surgery or angioplasty, two-thirds fewer than the 28 taking a placebo. The good news was offset by some worrisome findings. Eleven people died in the group taking anacetrapib, compared with eight taking a placebo. And 18% of patients were dropped from the study because their LDL fell so low that doctors worried they might not have enough. Only a much bigger, long-term study, Cannon says, will allow researchers to determine whether those findings pose a real risk to patients. Merck announced plans Wednesday to launch a 30,000-patient global study that is designed to show definitively whether the drug prevents heart attacks and deaths. The study's co-chairman, Rory Collins of Oxford University, says the organizers plan to keep the trial going for at least two and a half years even if the drug is so powerful that it quickly proves its effectiveness. ""This is a new class of drugs,"" Collins says. ""We need compelling evidence that it is both effective and safe."" Researchers are taking special pains to assure anacetrapib's safety, because the first drug in the class, Pfizer's torceptrapib, was found to cause heart attacks and deaths. An investigation showed the drug had an unexpected side effect that caused blood pressure to rise. No such side effects have been linked to anacetrapib, Merck's Luciano Rossetti says.

(Reuters) - Evofem Biosciences Inc said on Monday its birth control gel showed effectiveness in a late-stage study, bringing the first hormone-free contraceptive close to approval and sending its shares up 27 percent before the bell.  Male condoms and oral pills dominate the $5.5 billion contraceptive market in the United States. However, oral pills cause side effects such as bleeding between periods, mood swings and nausea in women.  “These results pave the way for Amphora’s disruption of the contraception market as a novel, highly effective, non-hormonal and woman-controlled method that finally answers women’s long-awaited desire to avoid hormones,” Roth Capital Partners analyst Yasmeen Rahimi said.  The gel works by regulating vaginal pH within the normal range of 3.5 to 4.5, creating a hostile environment for sperm and certain viral and bacterial pathogens that can cause sexually transmitted diseases.  Amphora was found to have a 86 percent efficacy rate in avoiding pregnancies and no serious side-effects were observed in the study, which evaluated about 1,400 healthy women belonging to the age group 18-35 years, Evofem said.  Oppenheimer analyst Leland Gershell said he expects Amphora, the company’s lead product, to bring in peak sales of $415 million by 2032.  The company plans to resubmit the marketing application for Amphora in the second quarter next year and if approved, plans to launch the product in January 2020.  Evofem is also testing Amphora as a preventive treatment for chlamydia and gonorrhea - two of the world’s most common sexually transmitted infections.	0
LONDON (Reuters) - A non-surgical treatment for low-risk prostate cancer in which doctors inject a light-sensitive drug derived from deep-sea bacteria into a patient’s bloodstream was shown in a trial to kill cancer cells without destroying healthy tissue.  Results of a trial in 413 patients showed that the drug, which is activated with a laser to destroy tumor tissue in the prostate, was so effective that half the patients went into remission, compared with 13.5 percent in a control group.  “These results are excellent news for men with early localized prostate cancer, offering a treatment that can kill cancer without removing or destroying the prostate,” said Mark Emberton, a University College London consultant urologist who led the trial. “This is truly a huge leap forward.”  The treatment, called vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy or VTP, was developed by scientists at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel in collaboration with the privately-owned STEBA Biotech.  The light-sensitive drug used, called WST11, is derived from bacteria found at the bottom of the ocean. To survive with very little sunlight, they have evolved to convert light into energy with incredible efficiency, Emberton’s team said in a study published in the journal Lancet Oncology.  The Weizmann scientists exploited this feature to develop WST11, a compound that releases free radicals to kill surrounding cells when activated by laser light.  Men with low-risk prostate cancer are currently put under active surveillance, where the disease is monitored and only treated when it becomes more severe. Radical therapy, which involves surgically removing or irradiating the whole prostate, has significant long-term side effects so is only used to treat high-risk cancers.  While radical therapy causes lifelong erectile problems and incontinence, VTP only caused short-term urinary and erectile problems which resolved within three months, the researchers said. No significant side-effects remained after two years.  In the trial, only 6 percent of patients treated with VTP needed radical therapy compared with 30 percent of patients in the control arm who were under active surveillance.  The trial involved 47 treatment sites in 10 European countries, most of which were performing VTP for the first time.  “The fact that the treatment was performed so successfully by non-specialist centers in various health systems is really remarkable,” Emberton said.  The VTP treatment is now being reviewed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for possible license, but it likely to be several years before it can be offered to patients more widely.	1
By Andrew M. Seaman  A girl helps herself to a buffet at a fast food restaurant in Harlem in New York December 16, 2009. REUTERS/Finbarr O'Reilly  (Reuters Health) - - People were less likely to go to the hospital with heart attacks or strokes after several counties in New York State restricted the use of trans fats, according to a new study.  Trans fats raise bad cholesterol, lower good cholesterol and ultimately increase the risk of heart attacks and strokes. They’re found naturally in some foods but are often manufactured and added to processed foods to improve taste and texture.  “New York City was progressive and they enacted restrictions on trans fats, but no one looked to see if this made measurable changes to outcomes,” said study lead author Dr. Eric Brandt, of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut.  New York City limited the use of trans fats starting in July 2007. The restrictions applied to food purchased outside of stores, such as at restaurants, street vendors and bakeries, in the city’s five counties. Other New York counties took similar actions after New York City’s measure was enacted.  Previous research found that death from cardiovascular disease declined 4.5 percent within a year after counties enacted trans fat restrictions, the researchers write in JAMA Cardiology. No study looked at non-fatal cardiovascular issues like hospitalizations due to heart attacks and strokes, however.  For the new study, the researchers compared data on people hospitalized between 2002 and 2013 for heart attacks or strokes in counties that did or didn’t restrict trans fats.  Altogether they had data on 3.3 million people in 25 counties without trans fat restrictions and 8.4 million people in 11 counties with restrictions.  In 2006, there were 753 hospital admissions for heart attack or stroke per 100,000 people in counties that never enacted restrictions compared to 726 per 100,000 people in counties that put restrictions in place.  While admissions for heart attacks and strokes fell after 2002 in all the counties, the drop was more substantial in those that enacted trans fat restrictions, the authors found.  After three years or more, the combined rate of hospitalizations for heart attacks or strokes was about 6 percent lower in the counties with trans fat regulations.  Admissions for heart attacks were nearly 8 percent lower in counties with restrictions. Similarly, admissions for strokes were about 4 percent lower in counties with restrictions, but that finding could be due to chance.  Brandt told Reuters Health that New York City was also pushing other public health initiatives around the same time. Those included clean air initiatives and showing calorie counts on restaurant menus.  When they removed New York City data to make sure those other factors weren’t driving the findings, the pattern didn’t change.  “We still found the same thing,” Brandt said.  Still, the study can’t say the trans fat restrictions caused fewer admissions in those counties.  Brandt and colleagues write that in 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) removed manufactured trans fats from its list of safe food additives. By 2018, those fats will be nearly eliminated from American diets, they add.  “There has been a lot of looking into whether trans fats are harmful,” said Brandt. “Here we find on a population level when we restrict them, it benefits society by reducing heart attacks and strokes.”  The findings suggest the FDA’s action will lead to health benefits across the country, he added.

Creatine supplements are extremely popular among amateur and pro athletes who believe the substance gives their muscles a boost. But a study finds that the supplements may also help women with knee osteoarthritis.  The findings, published online recently in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise, focused on postmenopausal women with knee osteoarthritis. For the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, some of the women took a creatine supplement for 12 weeks, while the others took a placebo.  Creatine is made up of amino acids and found naturally in the body. It’s carried in the blood to be used by the muscles. Taking it as a supplement is thought to enhance muscle function.  In the study both groups did a three-month lower limb strengthening program and were evaluated at the beginning of the study and at the end for factors such as physical function, lean mass, muscle strength, quality of life, pain and stiffness. The workouts consisted of resistance exercises done three times a week and included leg press, leg extension and half-squat exercises.  Advertisement  Only the group taking the creatine supplements showed substantial improvements in physical function. Stiffness also improved in the creatine group but not the placebo group. The creatine group showed significant gains in lower limb lean mass and quality of life compared with those who took the placebo. No differences in muscle strength or pain reduction were seen between the two groups.	1
"En Español  By Alan Mozes  HealthDay Reporter  MONDAY, March 28, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Acupuncture can help alleviate the often-debilitating hot flashes that afflict many breast cancer patients, new Italian research says.  Noting that hot flashes are a fact of life for many women with breast cancer, the investigators found that pairing lifestyle advice with weekly acupuncture sessions dramatically improved the women's quality of life.  ""Acupuncture together with enhanced self-care for three months is effective in reducing hot flashes in women with breast cancer,"" said study author Giorgia Razzini, a clinical trial project manager in the oncology unit of Ospedale di Carpi (Carpi Hospital), in Bologna, Italy.  And because hormone treatment for breast cancer typically makes the hot flash experience even worse, Razzini added, acupuncture could be a useful tool for helping such patients ""stay on their therapy and improve their quality of life.""  Razzini and colleagues published their findings online March 28 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.  In the study, the Italian team focused on 190 breast cancer patients who had reported moderate (or worse) hot flashes while undergoing treatment at five cancer hospitals and one primary health care center in northern Italy between 2010 and 2013.  The patients, whose average age was 49, were randomly split into two groups. One group of 105 patients was offered a three-month regimen of self-care advice on diet, exercise and psychological support.  The second group, of 85, was offered the same advice in the same time frame along with 10 half-hour weekly sessions of ""traditional"" acupuncture.  All of the participants kept hot flash diaries. At the end of the three-month period (and for up to six months thereafter) daily hot flash experiences were assessed for changing severity and frequency.  The result: by the end of the treatment period, those in the acupuncture group were found to have hot flash scores that were 50 percent lower than those in the non-acupuncture group. The finding continued to hold up for a half-year after the acupuncture sessions ended.  Those in the acupuncture group also seemed to have a generally higher overall quality of life in terms of both physical and mental health, with no serious side effects, the study authors said.  So why does acupuncture seem to work?  Razzini cited several reasons, including acupuncture's ability to prompt blood vessel dilation in the patient's nervous system, while stimulating the release of endorphins -- a neurotransmitter that interacts with brain cells involved in the regulation of pain and emotion. It also triggers the release of the stress hormone norepinephrine, as well as the mood regulator serotonin.  Razzini didn't know how much American patients might have to pay for such treatment, but added, ""Compared to other effective treatments such as antidepressants, (acupuncture) should be less expensive, and, for sure, more safe and feasible.""  Dr. Courtney Vito, a breast oncologic surgeon at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., was pleased that a serious issue in breast cancer treatment is getting a closer look.  ""Anyone who treats breast cancer struggles with this problem in their practice, because the hot flashes that some women experience with anti-hormonal treatment can be profound,"" she said.  ""Almost all women experience them. For some it's a moderate situation, but for others it's a really significant problem. Some women -- I would say probably about 15 percent -- have such severe hot flashes that they even refuse to take medications that can cut their risk for cancer or cancer recurrence by 50 percent, simply because they can't handle the hot flashes,"" Vito explained.  ""And I've actually had patients who have had acupuncture with good success, so I'm not surprised by the finding,"" she added. ""But it is heartening that we now have scientific proof that this can work. Which, in the end, may help to encourage insurance companies to their expand coverage so this can become an affordable option for all patients in need.""

Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia, can be fully cured with an anti-inflammatory drug commonly used for period pain, a new research by the University of Manchester shows. Currently, no drug medications can successfully treat chronic neurodegenerative disease, but certain medicines can help alleviate symptoms or slow down the progression.  Researchers, who conducted the study on mice, found that mefenamic acid — a common Non-Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) used to relieve menstrual pain — can completely reverse memory loss and brain inflammation that are hallmark changes of Alzheimer’s, which currently affects over five million Americans.  For the study, researchers used 20 transgenic mice that develop symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. The research was conducted when mice had developed memory problems. They were divided in groups of 10. First group was given mefenamic acid dose and the other group was given placebo for one month through a mini-pump implanted under the skin.  Researchers observed that memory loss was fully reversed to the levels seen in mice without Alzheimer’s.  “There is experimental evidence now to strongly suggest that inflammation in the brain makes Alzheimer’s disease worse. Our research shows for the first time that mefenamic acid, a simple [NSAID] can target an important inflammatory pathway called the NLRP3 inflammasome, which damages brain cells,” David Brough, lead author of the study said, in a statement.  Brough, however, cautioned that further research is required to identify its impact on humans and the long-term implications.  “However, much more work needs to be done until we can say with certainty that it will tackle the disease in humans as mouse models don't always faithfully replicate the human disease. Because this drug is already available and the toxicity and pharmacokinetics of the drug is known, the time for it to reach patients should, in theory, be shorter than if we were developing completely new drugs,” Brough said.  Researchers said that the lab results identify a class of existing drugs that are likely to treat Alzheimer’s by blocking a particular part of the immune response. But, they also warned that these “drugs are not without side effects and should not be taken for Alzheimer’s disease at this stage - studies in people are needed first.”  The research was published in the journal Nature Communications on Thursday.	1
"Tai Chi, A 'Medication In Motion,' Helps People With Heart Failure  Enlarge this image toggle caption Robert F. Bukaty/AP Robert F. Bukaty/AP  Visit an urban park in China any given morning or late afternoon, and you're likely to find elderly people engaged in a slow, elegant dance, their arms and legs lifting and circling in unison. Tinny traditional music might be playing from a battery-run cassette player. The seniors are focused and at ease in their daily ritual, and it's soothing to watch them.  The movement is tai chi, an ancient martial art turned exercise, and a study out this week in Archives of Internal Medicine says it may help people suffering from heart failure feel better about life. In a quality of life questionnaire the researchers gave out, those who practiced tai chi scored significantly higher than those who hadn't been doing the movement. The tai chi group also reported an improvement in mood.  Heart failure is a tough disease to live with; the shortness of breath and low energy that can come because the heart can't pump enough blood make physical activity unappealing. ""Historically, patients with chronic systolic heart failure were considered too frail to exercise and, through the late 1980s, avoidance of physical activity was a standard recommendation,"" the study's authors write.  The Chinese developed tai chi thousands of years ago, but it has recently piqued the interest of Western medicine as an alternative mind-body therapy to treat disease. According to a Harvard Medical School newsletter, tai chi is increasingly seen as a form of 'medication in motion.'  It's been shown to be useful in treating a wide range of diseases from breast cancer to Parkinson's. The National Institutes of Health has also jumped on board and is funding a variety of studies on tai chi for chronic disease.  The Archives of Internal Medicine study is the first large clinical trial to look at whether a tai chi program can do anything for people with heart failure. The researchers recruited 100 people with the chronic condition from heart clinics in Boston. About half were randomly assigned to receive a 12-week tai chi exercise program. The other half got a heart health education program.  The tai chi program started off with some traditional warm-up exercises of arm swinging, gentle stretches, breathing, and visualization techniques. Then patients learned five simple movements designed to release tension in the body, increase awareness of breathing, and relax the body and mind. Patients got an instructional video tape, and were encouraged to practice at home at least 3 times a week.  The study authors say there's a usually a strong relationship between depression and heart failure, so the fact that tai chi helped cheer people up was an especially good sign."	1
"Surgery For Sinus Misery: Better, But Still No Cure  toggle caption Richard Knox/NPR  Surgeon Ralph Metson stares at a big video screen that shows, with amazing clarity, the inside of Nancy Butler's nasal passages.  A weird glow lights up her nose and cheek from within. It comes from the fiber-optic tip of Metson's endoscope, which also holds a high-res camera lens.  On the monitor, you can see the miniature instruments he's using to cut away inflamed tissue and snip away pieces of eggshell-thin bone that block Butler's sinuses and give her nonstop headaches. To avoid poking through to the brain or into the orbit of an eye, there's a device around the patient's head with a guidance system that tells Metson, in three dimensions, exactly where his sharp instruments are on a CT scan of Butler's head.  After an hour or so of this delicate work, Metson has opened up the 72-year-old woman's sinuses so they can drain. ""The next time she gets a cold,"" he says, ""her membranes are not going to swell and block the sinuses the way they have in the past. They're going to stay open.""  This is modern sinus surgery. It's a lot less brutal than the old days -- back in the early 1980s. Then, surgeons cut through the face and mouth, scraped out the sinuses and left patients bruised and scarred. Often they were no better off, sometimes worse.  Advances since then have persuaded more doctors to do sinus surgery. So a lot more people are getting it -- around 300,000 a year, making it one of the most common operations.  But how good is it, in terms of giving patients relief from the pain, breathing difficulty and fatigue of chronic sinusitis?  ""Surgery is usually not curative,"" Metson says. ""But probably in over 90 percent of the cases, it does significantly improve a patient's quality of life. He or she will still have infections after surgery. But hopefully they'll be less frequent, less severe and shorter in duration. A brief course of antibiotics will work better after surgery.""  Health Columnist Opts For Sinus Surgery  Judy Foreman, another of Metson's patients, offers an example of both how surgery can help -- and why patients' expectations shouldn't be too high.  Foreman had sinus surgery two years ago, when she was 64, after trying everything else. (See sidebar.) She rinsed out her sinuses faithfully with saltwater. She tried decongestants, antihistamines and steroid nasal sprays. Over and over, Metson prescribed antibiotics.  Soothing Sinus Pain Surgery may be less debilitating than it once was, but it’s still the last resort for most people suffering from sinus problems. Here are three simpler treatments that may offer sinus relief. Nasal irrigation, also known as nasal douche or nasal lavage, is one option. The idea is to rinse the sinuses with saltwater. The easiest way is with a bulb syringe or neti pot, which looks like a small tea pot. As the saline solution passes through one nostril and out the other, it clears mucus, dust and allergen particles from the sinus cavities. (Several YouTube videos offer tutorials on nasal irrigation.) The technique might seem peculiar, but it's nothing new. It likely originated from yoga traditions as a way to fight cold symptoms, but it went mainstream after a nod from Oprah. Studies show that nasal irrigation seems to work. A 2009 review of research by The Cochrane Library found evidence that nasal irrigation with saltwater can relieve symptoms and can help as a complementary treatment for chronic rhinosinusitis. Kits for nasal irrigation usually cost $10 to $20 and are sold in drugstores. Another option is corticosteroid nasal sprays. According to the Mayo Clinic, corticosteroids imitate hormones and can help alleviate inflammation. However, the sprays seem to provide only temporary relief for most users. A few small studies suggest that acupuncture may also benefit some people with sinus problems, but, as one study in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine indicated, more research is needed. —Whitney Blair Wyckoff  For about 80 percent of patients, these nonsurgical alternatives manage the problem adequately, Metson says. But Foreman was in the other 20 percent.  Foreman writes a health column for The Boston Globe and other newspapers, so she's an unusually well-informed patient. ""I read an article about people feeling less tired all the time after having had surgery, and I thought, boy, I would really like that,"" she says.  When she asked Metson about surgery, he said most people with her degree of sinus problems would have had it long before.  ""I thought, 'OK, so I'm just being scared,' "" Foreman says. She didn't like to think of someone sticking sharp instruments up her nose and cutting away delicate tissue. But when she overcame her squeamishness and finally had the operation, she found it wasn't nearly as bad as she thought it would be.  ""It's uncomfortable,"" she reports. ""Afterwards you have these cotton wads up your nose and, of course, you can't breathe wit"	0
For women older than 50 who have been confused by conflicting advice on how frequently to get a mammogram, some new science is here to guide their decisions.  An ambitious research effort published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine set out to tailor women’s breast cancer screening practices to match their actual risk of breast cancer. It concludes that a woman’s breast density should influence the frequency with which she is screened for breast cancer, in addition to such long-recognized breast cancer risk factors as age, ethnicity, personal history of abnormal breast findings and a family history of breast cancer.  For a small slice of those women, that makes a once-a-year mammogram — twice as often as the current standard — the best bet.  Underwritten by the National Cancer Institute, the new study combined the data-collection efforts of breast-cancer epidemiologists with three separate teams of cancer modelers. In the study, women were separated into subcategories based on four levels each of individual risk and breast density.  Advertisement  The research recommends that women older than 50 with dense breast tissue who have higher-than-normal risk of developing breast cancer should get annual mammograms. These women, however, represent a small minority of women in that age group — less than 1% of all women between 50 and 74.  Many women, however, could go as long as three years between mammograms without increasing their risk of death from breast cancer, the study found. For women with average risk and low breast density, the models showed that there was no difference in deaths averted from breast cancer whether they were screened every two years or every three years. Women who had a mammogram every three years, however, had fewer unnecessary follow-up procedures, including biopsies.  Accepted clinical guidelines recommend that women 50 to 74 get a mammogram every two years. These recommendations, first proposed in 2009 by a federal task force, urged women to discuss with their physicians whether more frequent screening might be in order. But they have continued to be controversial with some activist and medical groups that believe additional lives could be saved if more women got an annual mammogram.  The latest study largely validates the controversial recommendations made by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in 2009. But it also clarifies which women should or could depart safely from its recommendations.  Advertisement  Only in the last decade or so have radiologists, oncologists and women’s health specialists begun to appreciate the role of breast density in a woman’s breast cancer risk. While radiologists have long warned that dense breast tissue made cancerous masses harder to spot, mounting evidence has found that cancer is also more likely to gain a foothold in dense breast tissue.  The latest effort is the first to produce a risk calculator that takes that into account, and asks for a radiologist’s standardized assessment of breast density in its six-point questionnaire. Many states now require radiologists reading mammograms to assign and communicate to a woman and her physician this density measure, called a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System, or BI-RADS, score.  Overall, the risk measure calculates a woman’s likelihood of developing breast cancer over five and 10 years, and compares it to normal risk.  In devising their models, the researchers updated assumptions that have cast doubt on the relevance of existing breast-cancer risk calculators, which relied on the experiences of women who got an earlier generation of screening mammograms and were more likely to die of breast cancer than is currently the case. Here, teams of modelers from Erasmus University in the Netherlands, Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York and Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare assumed that women were getting digital mammograms, which offer improved cancer detection rates at lower radiation dosages than earlier mammographic methods. They took into account improved rates of breast cancer treatment effectiveness, and changing causes of mortality for women older than 50. They also took account of the fact that breast density decreases in older women.  “These models are very applicable to the populations we screen,” said UC San Francisco breast-cancer specialist Dr. Karla Kerlikowske, one of the lead authors of the new study.  The practice of tailoring screening intervals to a woman’s breast cancer risk is already widespread in some European countries, including Sweden, the Netherlands and Spain. A Spanish study, similar to the latest modeling effort, found that implementing a general three-year screening interval, with yearly screening for high-risk women, reduced overdiagnosis and caught more missed cancers.  “Some lesions detected in screening will never grow to become clinically significant and will not impact a woman’s life,” Kerlikowske said.  melissa.healy@latimes.com  Advertisement  Follow me	0
Harrison Shull via Getty Images  Pop a Tylenol and take a brisk walk for protection against prostate cancer? That’s what the findings of two new studies published this week suggest.  In the first study, published Monday in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention, scientists found that men who took a daily dose of acetaminophen (Tylenol) for five years had a 38% lower risk of developing prostate cancer, compared with other men. Additionally, daily acetaminophen was associated with a 51% reduced risk of developing an aggressive form of the disease. Men who took acetaminophen for less than five years saw no protective benefit.  (More on TIME.com: Coffee Drinking Linked With Lower Risk of Fatal Prostate Cancer)  Previous research has shown that taking aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) every day may help reduce prostate cancer risk. The authors theorize that the same may be true of acetaminophen; while not an NSAID, it does have anti-inflammatory properties.  For the study, the researchers looked at data from 78,485 men who participated in the longitudinal Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort, answering questions about diet and drug use every two years starting in 1992. During the follow-up, there were 8,092 cases of prostate cancer — significantly fewer in the group who took acetaminophen daily for five years.  The second study, published online Tuesday by Cancer Research, involved 1,455 men who had already been diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer. Researchers from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and Harvard School of Public Health followed the men from 2004 to 2009 and found that those who engaged in regular brisk walking after diagnosis were significantly less likely to see their disease progress.  (More on TIME.com: Study: Gay Men Are Twice as Likely to Have Cancer)  Men who walked briskly — at a pace of about 3 miles per hour or faster — at least three hours per week were 57% less likely to experience disease progression (including elevated PSA levels, secondary treatment, bone metastasis or prostate cancer-related death), compared with men who walked less and more slowly.  “The important point was the intensity of the activity,” Erin Richman, a postdoctoral fellow at UCSF, said in a statement. “The walking had to be brisk for men to experience a benefit.”  The researchers said the effect of brisk walking persisted independent of age, diagnosis, type of treatment and characteristics of disease. The patients’ average age at diagnosis was 65. The findings are in line with previous research suggesting that physical activity may help reduce the risk of disease-related death in certain cases of prostate cancer.  (More on TIME.com: Using Toenails to Predict Risk of Lung Cancer)  Why the association? MedPage Today reports:  Richman and colleagues noted that the brisk walks may reduce insulin resistance, which decreases bioavailable insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) and increases adiponectin levels, which are all associated with decreased risk of advanced or fatal prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo. Another potential source of the associated reduction was reduced inflammation due to a lower circulation of interleukin-6, high levels of which “predicted a 73% increased risk of dying from prostate cancer among normal-weight men,” the researchers wrote.  Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men. According to the National Cancer Institute, about 32,050 men died from prostate cancer in 2010 and 217,000 new cases were diagnosed. More than 2.2 million men in the U.S. are living with prostate cancer.	1
"SUNDAY, May 2, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- One reason many people dread a colonoscopy is the unpleasant preparation, which often requires that they drink a gallon of prescribed fluids to clear out their bowels before the procedure. But an industry-funded study suggests that a pill could negate the need for so much liquid.  Researchers from Henry Ford Hospital report that people preparing for the test were able to take a pill approved as a treatment for chronic constipation and avoid half of the liquid requirement.  In the study, 126 people took either the pill -- lubiprostone (Amitiza) -- or an inactive placebo. Those who took the combination of the pill and liquid were better able to tolerate the preparation than were those who drank a gallon of a mixture of polyethylene glycol and electrolytes, the study found.  ""Most people say they don't want to have a colonoscopy because they find the preparation intolerable,"" the study's lead author, Dr. Chetan Pai, a gastroenterologist, said in a news release from the hospital. ""If physicians are able to offer a better way to prep, I think this will encourage more people to get the colonoscopies that may save their lives.""  Pai also pointed out that about 90 percent of colon cancer cases occur in people older than 50, an age group that tends to have an especially hard time drinking the gallon of liquid often prescribed for colonoscopy preparation.  The study, scheduled to be presented Sunday at the Digestive Diseases Week conference in New Orleans, was funded by the pill's manufacturer, Sucampo Pharmaceuticals.

"En Español  By Serena Gordon  HealthDay Reporter  THURSDAY, May 3, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Much of the debate over when to start having mammograms has focused on lives saved, but new research suggests that early screening might also translate into smaller tumors and less aggressive breast cancer treatments.  ""There are multiple benefits of mammography in terms of early detection. Not only do we save lives, but we reduce the likelihood of needing more aggressive treatment,"" said study author Dr. Elisa Port. She directs the Dubin Breast Center at Mount Sinai and is chief of breast surgery at Mount Sinai Hospital, both in New York City.  Currently, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that biennial screenings start at age 50 for most women, while the American Cancer Society advises that annual screenings begin at age 45. Earlier guidelines had suggested annual screenings begin at age 40.  Port noted that screening guidelines tend to be based on the ability of mammograms to save lives and how often they give a false positive result.  ""But isn't there some benefit to getting tested earlier, like needing fewer lymph nodes removed and not needing chemotherapy? I think it's safe to say that most women, if they could be assured the same survival, would choose not to get more aggressive therapies,"" she said.  Port's study included more than 1,100 women diagnosed with breast cancer at the Dubin Breast Center. All of the women were older than 40.  The women were separated into two groups. One group had a mammogram within the 24 months before their breast cancer diagnosis. The other group had a screening 25 months or more before their diagnosis. The second group also included women who had never had a mammogram.  Women in the second group were 50 percent more likely to need chemotherapy. They were also 32 percent more likely to need surgery to remove the whole breast (mastectomy), and 66 percent more likely to need lymph nodes removed. And the women who were screened earlier had smaller tumors.  Port also looked at the 40- to 49-year-old age group, and found those who had never had a mammogram were much more likely to need chemotherapy. They were also more likely to have larger tumors (by 10 millimeters, on average) and to need a mastectomy than those in the 24 months or less group. But only 29 women fell into the ""never had a mammogram"" group.  However, the study did not prove a cause-and-effect link between earlier mammograms and smaller tumors and less aggressive treatment.  And Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, noted that this was an observational study that only looked at the experience of one institution.  Still, ""the observations are consistent with what we have seen with the value of early detection. Clearly, the earlier a breast cancer is diagnosed, the less treatment that will be required. But this study doesn't tell us about long-term outcomes or what transpired over a long period of time,"" he said.  Also, because of the nature of the study and the small sample size in the young age group sub-analysis, Lichtenfeld said that ""this cannot be interpreted as a study telling us what age to start mammograms.""  The study is to be presented Thursday at the American Society of Breast Surgeons meeting, in Orlando, Fla. Findings presented at meetings are typically viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Considering having a surgeon remove your cancerous prostate using a robot? You might want to see a surgeon who has done at least 80 operations for the best results, according to the authors of a new research review.  And while the robot-assisted operation is now the “dominant approach” to this surgery in the US and is gaining popularity in other wealthy nations, there’s still too little information on how patients fare after the surgery, Dr. Declan G. Murphy of the Peter MacCallum Cancer Center in Melbourne, Australia and his colleagues write.  Laparoscopic surgery, in which a surgeon performs the operation through small incisions, usually with the help of a surgical robot, has been touted as carrying a lower risk of incontinence and impotence than the standard “open” form of the surgery.  But a US study on nearly 9,000 men published in October 2009 found that while open and minimally invasive surgery were equally good for getting rid of prostate cancer, the risk of incontinence and impotence was higher with the minimally invasive approach.  In the current study, Murphy and his team looked at 68 studies of robot-assisted laparoscopic surgery to better understand its downsides. Lack of information on outcomes isn’t only a problem for robot-assisted surgery, but “bedevils” the scientific literature on prostate removal overall, the researchers note in the journal European Urology.  In about one in 250 surgeries, the robot failed to work properly. There was also a lack of data on how well patients functioned after surgery, and how patients with high-risk prostate cancer fared long-term.  And while some studies showed low complication rates, the researchers add, those rates went up when doctors used a standardized approach to reporting complications. The authors did not compare robotic surgery complication rates to traditional surgery rates.  The researchers also found that surgeons who have done fewer than 20 of the robot-assisted procedures can achieve “acceptable operating times.” Keeping surgeries shorter is a goal because it usually means fewer complications. It may be necessary, however, for surgeons to do 80 or more procedures to ensure that they do not leave cancerous tissue behind.  Also, the researchers add, robot-assisted surgery is no easier to perform and has no better outcomes in patients with conditions that can worsen surgical outcomes, such as being obese, having a large prostate, or having had previous surgery in the area.  Finally, the researchers note, expenses associated with the procedure—the robot costs at least 1.8 million ($2.6 million) to install, 100,000 ($145,000) a year to run, and 1,500 ($2,200) extra for each surgical case-mean the procedure is “prohibitively” expensive “for many hospitals and indeed many countries.”  The researchers conclude: “The significant learning curve should not be understated, and the expense of this technology continues to restrict access to many patients.”  SOURCE: European Association of Urology, online December 16, 2009	0
“These data support the vision that we have long had for fundamentally changing the treatment for hepatitis C,” Dr. Robert Kauffman, Vertex’s chief medical officer, said in a conference call with securities analysts.  The results also keep Vertex at the front of a crowded field that has made hepatitis C one of the fiercest battlegrounds in the pharmaceutical business. Merck is expected to announce late-stage trial results of a similar drug, boceprevir, this year. And numerous other companies, from pharmaceutical giants to small start-ups, are in hot pursuit.  Both Vertex’s telaprevir and Merck’s boceprevir block an enzyme known as protease that is made by the virus. Most of the other new drugs also work by blocking viral enzymes. This direct antiviral approach has been used with great success in treating H.I.V. and AIDS.  Vertex itself says it expects results from two additional Phase 3 trials of telaprevir in the third quarter and will then apply to the Food and Drug Administration for approval of the drug.  Some 2.7 million to 3.9 million Americans are estimated to have hepatitis C, and 12,000 die from it each year, according to a recent report by the Institute of Medicine.  The disease can cause cirrhosis, which is a scarring of the liver, as well as liver cancer. The virus is transmitted by blood, so most people who have hepatitis C either have injected illegal drugs or received blood transfusions or blood products before the early 1990s.

For patients with the type of hepatitis most prevalent in the United States, which is called Genotype 1, the treatment lasts nearly a year and can cause side effects that include flulike symptoms, anemia and depression. It is so arduous that many patients opt not to get treated or drop out before completing the course.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  But in Vertex’s trial, about 70 percent of those who achieved an effective cure were able to do so in 24 weeks, or about six months. That shorter time line, plus a higher chance of success, could entice more people to be treated, experts say.  “If you can promise them six months with a reasonable chance of a cure, that’s a meaningful advance,” said Dr. Scott L. Friedman, chief of the division of liver diseases at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.  If approved, telaprevir would have to be used initially with the existing drugs to prevent the virus from evolving resistance. But experts hope that eventually several of the pills now in development could be used together, much as AIDS is treated, doing away with the need for interferon.  Vertex’s clinical trial enrolled 1,095 patients in the United States and abroad who had Genotype 1 hepatitis C and had not been treated previously. Patients got either 12 weeks or eight weeks of telaprevir or a placebo. The standard therapy of interferon and ribavirin was given for either 24 weeks or 48 weeks, depending on how the patients were faring after four weeks and 12 weeks.  Of those who got 12 weeks of telaprevir, 75 percent had a sustained viral response, meaning the virus was not detectable in their blood 24 weeks after completing treatment. That is seen as essentially a cure. The rate was 69 percent for those who got eight weeks of telaprevir.  The drug can cause a nasty rash and increases the rate of anemia. About 7 percent of the patients getting telaprevir dropped out of the trial, about double the figure for the control group.  Lorren Sandt, chairwoman of the National Viral Hepatitis Roundtable, an advocacy group, called the trial results impressive. But she added, “The community hopes that if telaprevir is approved by the F.D.A. that it will be accessible and affordable to everyone.”  Vertex, which is based in Cambridge, Mass., has not said what it would charge. But analysts expect the drug to cost tens of thousands of dollars for a course of treatment.	0
Obesity Surgery Helps Diabetic Patients Kick Medicines  Most people turning to surgery for weight loss are probably concerned with how many pounds they can expect to shed.  But an analysis of insurance claims for more than 2,200 people with Type 2 diabetes who underwent stomach-reducing surgery found that the vast majority of them were able to drop drugs they had been taking to treat the condition beforehand.  A year after surgery more than 80 percent of patients were no longer taking any of the diabetes medicines they had been on before the operations. The most common drugs before treatment were metformin, a generic taken by about half of patients, followed by the medicines Avandia and Actos, taken by more than one-third of patients.  The Johns Hopkins researchers also calculated the effects of surgery on health costs for the patients. After a $616 increase in expenses during the first year following surgery, the costs declined by $2,179 in the second year and $4,497 in year three. The costs were compared with the median annual health costs before surgery -- $6,367.  The researchers argue that the findings, drawn from data on four years of claims made in seven states, support coverage of bariatric surgery by insurers because of the savings and improvements in patients' health.  The ultimate savings case requires some extrapolation, though. The cost of the surgery was about $30,000, which exceeds the savings observed directly. Also, at two years after surgery, data were available for less than half the patients. By year three, the data were only available for 288 patients, about 13 percent of those who got the surgery.  Finally, surgery isn't without risk. While mortality in the hospital was 0.3 percent, some 21 percent of patients had to be admitted to the hospital again for one reason or another within a year of their operations.  The findings appear in the latest Archives of Surgery.	0
Blood and urine test, believed to be first of its kind, could lead to earlier diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders  Scientists in Britain say they have developed a blood and urine test that can detect autism in children.  Researchers at the University of Warwick said the test, believed to be the first of its kind, could lead to earlier diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in children who could then be given appropriate treatment much earlier in their lives.  ASDs mainly affect a person’s social interaction and communication, with symptoms that can include speech disturbances, repetitive and/or compulsive behaviour, hyperactivity, anxiety, and difficulty adapting to new environments.  As there is a wide range of ASD symptoms, diagnosis can be difficult and uncertain, particularly at the early stages of development. It is estimated that about one in every 100 people in the UK has ASD, with more boys diagnosed with the condition than girls.  Scientists said their research found a link between ASD and damage to proteins in blood plasma. They found the most reliable of the tests they developed was examining protein in blood plasma, which found children with ASD had higher levels of the oxidation marker dityrosine (DT) and certain sugar-modified compounds called advanced glycation end-products (AGEs).  Genetic causes are thought to be responsible for about a third of cases of ASD, while the rest are believed to be caused by a combination of environmental factors, mutations, and rare genetic variants. However, researchers believe their new tests could reveal yet-to-be-identified causes of ASD.  They also confirmed the previously held belief that mutations of amino acid transporters are a genetic variant associated with ASD.  The Warwick team worked with collaborators at the University of Bologna in Italy, who recruited 38 children who had been diagnosed with ASD along with a control group of 31 other children between the ages of five and 12. Blood and urine samples were taken from the children for analysis.  The Warwick team discovered there were chemical differences between the two groups. Working with a further collaborator at the University of Birmingham, the changes in multiple compounds were combined using artificial intelligence algorithm techniques to develop a mathematical equation to distinguish between ASD and healthy controls. The outcome was a diagnostic test better than any existing method.  They said the next steps were to repeat the study with further groups of children to confirm the good diagnostic performance and to assess if the test could identify ASD at very early stages, indicate how the ASD is likely to develop further to more severe disease, and assess if treatments were working.  The research was led by Naila Rabbani, reader of experimental systems biology at the University of Warwick, who said: “Our discovery could lead to earlier diagnosis and intervention. We hope the tests will also reveal new causative factors.  “With further testing we may reveal specific plasma and urinary profiles – or ‘fingerprints’ – of compounds with damaging modifications. This may help us improve the diagnosis of ASD and point the way to new causes of ASD.”  The research has been published in the journal Molecular Autism.  • Note added 27 February 2018: The UK autism research charity, Autistica, provided the following comment to the Guardian: “This is a small, early-stage study which may explain one biological difference in autism. At this stage, the results presented are not strong enough to suggest that this method could be used for the diagnosis of autism. For example, we don’t know whether this technique can distinguish autism from ADHD, anxiety or other similar conditions. There have been many previous attempts to develop a biological test for autism. Still, the best way to diagnose autism is through clinical interview and observation, which takes into account the many features of autism.”	1
"Delayed Umbilical Cord Clamping May Benefit Children Years Later  A couple of extra minutes attached to the umbilical cord at birth may translate into a small boost in neurodevelopment several years later, a study suggests.  Children whose cords were cut more than three minutes after birth had slightly higher social skills and fine motor skills than those whose cords were cut within 10 seconds. The results showed no differences in IQ.  ""There is growing evidence from a number of studies that all infants, those born at term and those born early, benefit from receiving extra blood from the placenta at birth,"" said Dr. Heike Rabe, a neonatologist at Brighton & Sussex Medical School in the United Kingdom. Rabe's editorial accompanied the study published Tuesday in the journal JAMA Pediatrics.  Delaying the clamping of the cord allows more blood to transfer from the placenta to the infant, sometimes increasing the infant's blood volume by up to a third. The iron in the blood increases infants' iron storage, and iron is essential for healthy brain development.  ""The extra blood at birth helps the baby to cope better with the transition from life in the womb, where everything is provided for them by the placenta and the mother, to the outside world,"" Rabe said. ""Their lungs get more blood so that the exchange of oxygen into the blood can take place smoothly.""  Past studies have shown higher levels of iron and other positive effects later in infancy among babies whose cords were clamped after several minutes, but few studies have looked at results past infancy.  In this study, researchers randomly assigned half of 263 healthy Swedish full-term newborns to have their cords clamped more than three minutes after birth. The other half were clamped less than 10 seconds after birth.  Four years later, the children underwent a series of assessments for IQ, motor skills, social skills, problem-solving, communication skills and behavior. Those with delayed cord clamping showed modestly higher scores in social skills and fine motor skills. When separated by sex, only the boys showed statistically significant improvement.  ""We don't know exactly why, but speculate that girls receive extra protection through higher estrogen levels whilst being in the womb,"" Rabe said. ""The results in term infants are consistent with those of follow-up in preterm infants.""  Delayed cord clamping has garnered more attention in the past few years for its potential benefits to the newborn. Until recently, clinicians believed early clamping reduced the risk of hemorrhaging in the mother, but research hasn't borne that out.  Much of the research has focused on preterm infants, who appear to benefit most from delayed cord clamping, Rabe said. Preemies who have delayed cord clamping tend to have better blood pressure in the days immediately after birth, need fewer drugs to support blood pressure, need fewer blood transfusions, have less bleeding into the brain and have a lower risk of necrotizing enterocolitis, a life-threatening bowel injury, she said.  This study is among the few looking at healthy, full-term infants in a country high in resources, as opposed to developing countries where iron deficiency may be more likely.  The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists has not yet endorsed the practice, citing insufficient evidence for full-term infants. The World Health Organization recommends delayed cord clamping of not less than one minute.  It is unclear whether the practice could harm infants' health. Some studies have found a higher risk of jaundice, a buildup of bilirubin in the blood from the breakdown of red blood cells. Jaundice is treated with blue light therapy and rarely has serious complications.  Another potential risk is a condition called polycythemia, a very high red blood cell count, said Dr. Scott Lorch, an associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Pennsylvania Perelman School of Medicine and director of the Center for Perinatal and Pediatric Health Disparities Research at Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.  ""Polycythemia can have medical consequences for the infant, including blood clots, respiratory distress and even strokes in the worst-case scenario,"" Lorch said. Some studies have found higher levels of red blood cells in babies with delayed cord clamping, but there were no complications.  Lorch also pointed out that this study involved a mostly homogenous population in a country outside the U.S.  ""We should see whether similar effects are seen in higher-risk populations, such as the low socioeconomic population, racial and ethnic minorities and those at higher risk for neurodevelopmental delay,"" Lorch said.  So far, studies on delayed cord clamping have excluded infants born in distress, such as those with breathing difficulties or other problems. But Rabe said these infants may actually benefit most from the practice.  These babies often need more blood volume to help with blood pressure, breathi"	0
"The most common sexually transmitted disease is often silent and invisible: human papillomavirus (also called HPV). But in some people HPV leads to genital warts and cancers – notably, cervical cancer.  The vaccines Gardasil and Cervarix were designed as a prevention for young women who have not yet been exposed to HPV. Men up to age 26 are also eligible for Gardasil to protect against HPV. But there are a lot of people out there who still have HPV, and nothing protects against all 130 strains of the virus. At least half of all sexually active males and females have had HPV, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.  A Pennsylvania start-up company called Inovio Pharmaceuticals has developed an experimental vaccine for people who already have HPV and precancerous lesions that are associated with it. A new study demonstrating the vaccine's safety and potential effectiveness was published this week in the journal Science Translational Medicine.    The experimental vaccine does not use the live HPV virus; it is formulated in synthetic DNA and pure water. It uses the immune system of the treated women to fight off cancer, said Joseph Kim, president and CEO of Inovio Pharmaceuticals and study co-author.  Worldwide, cervical cancer is the second most common cancer after breast cancer, with about 493,000 new cases and 274,000 deaths annually, the study said. HPV causes about 5% of cancers globally.  Some women, because of their particular genetic makeup, can clear precancerous lesions on their own and would not need this vaccine. This happens in anywhere from 10% to 25% of women infected with HPV, Kim said.  No one knows why some women have this capability and others do not, but for those who lack it the Inovio vaccine is ""giving our immune system a little boost,"" Kim said.  Eighteen women with high-grade precancerous cervical lesions participated in the phase 1 study.  Study authors say the vaccine is formulated to work against all cancers caused by HPV types 16 and 18, including cervical, anogenital (anal and genital), and head and neck cancers. The researchers did not observe any side effects.  In the next phase of this research 150 women worldwide are participating, but they are not included in these published results, Kim said.  The phase 1 results are very early in the experimentation of this vaccine. The study was not done as a randomized controlled trial, the gold standard for determining whether a drug works better than chance. Also, 18 people is a small number for examining the effects of a medication.  Given those drawbacks, it’s not appropriate to draw too many conclusions from this study, says Dr. Diane Harper, a prominent HPV researcher at the University of Missouri – Kansas City’s School of Medicine. Harper contributed to the studies on both HPV vaccines that are currently available, Cervarix and Gardasil, and is not involved with this research.  “Several therapeutic vaccines have shown great promise in phase 1 and then not panned out in phase 2,” she noted in an e-mail.  The vaccine consists of three injections in the arm over three months, Kim said. The vaccine trains T-cells in the body to go after cervical cells with potentially cancerous genes embedded in them.  Inovio is using this technology to develop vaccines for prostate cancer and HIV also, Kim said.  “We certainly have a technology that can change the medical field by being able to program and generate strong immune responses that are specific and effective,” he said.  Kim said the next phase results should be out at the end of 2013; then comes a larger phase 3 trial with about 500 patients, to be concluded around 2016 or 2017.  HPV is spread through genital contact, including oral sex, and partners can bounce the virus back and forth between them, making it harder to clear naturally. Kissing is not known to deliver this STD."	0
Botox Works As Well As Nerve Stimulator for Incontinence – Study	0
NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Taking multivitamins may help women without cardiovascular disease to ward off a heart attack, new research shows.  But vitamin pills seemed to have less of an effect in women with heart disease, Dr. Susanne Rautiainen of the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden, and her colleagues found.  The results don’t settle the question of whether it’s actually the vitamin pills that are protective, Rautiainen told Reuters Health via e-mail.  “It is very important to keep in mind that multivitamin users tend be ‘healthier’ in general. They usually smoke less, are more physically active and have a healthier diet,” the researcher wrote. “Even if we have controlled for many of those factors that are associated with a healthy behavior we cannot exclude the possibility that we might measure a healthy lifestyle via multivitamin use.”  Approximately half of American adults report taking a multivitamin regularly.  In industrialized countries, Rautiainen and her team note in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, multivitamin use is widespread. While conventional wisdom holds that taking vitamins could help prevent heart disease, the researchers add, there’s actually little evidence to back up this claim.  To investigate the relationship between vitamin use and heart disease in women, Rautiainen and her team followed 31,671 women with no history of heart disease and 2,262 women who did have cardiovascular disease for about 10 years. The women ranged in age from 49 to 83 at the study’s outset, and about 60 percent in each group used some type of dietary supplement.  During the observed period, 932 heart attacks occurred among the women without heart disease, while 269 women with existing heart disease had heart attacks.  Among the women who initially had no heart disease and did not take any dietary supplements, 3.4 percent had heart attacks, compared to 2.6 percent of the women who took multivitamins plus other supplements; this translated to a 27 percent lower heart attack risk with vitamins. Among the women with heart disease, 13 percent of the non-supplement-users had heart attacks, compared to 14 percent of women who took multivitamins only, which wasn’t a statistically significant difference (meaning it could have been due to chance).  For the women without heart disease at the study’s outset, taking a multivitamin for less than five years reduced heart attack risk by 18 percent compared with non-users of supplements. Taking vitamins for 10 or more years cut risk by 41 percent.  Similar studies have been done in men, with some confirming the current findings and others contradicting them, Rautiainen said. She concluded: “The question of whether multivitamins are good for you still remains!”  SOURCE: link.reuters.com/bub56p The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, online September 22, 2010.	0
NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Science doesn’t just help to invent new products, it can push existing ones.  Inneov Sun Sensitivity in an undated image. REUTERS/L’Oreal/Laboratoires innéov  Look no further than the beauty industry. It does lots of testing and flaunts products with scientific terms like microbeads, enzymes and rejuvenating serums. But what are the data behind them? And what if the company selling the product did the tests?  Take Inneov Sun Sensitivity, a nutritional supplement “clinically proven” to protect your skin from the sun’s harmful UV rays while leaving you with a nice tan, according to its maker Laboratoires Inneov, a joint venture between L’Oreal and Nestle.  The pill combines lycopene and beta-carotene — the red and orange substances in tomatoes and carrots, respectively — with a probiotic reported to impact the skin’s response to UV light.  “The efficacy of our nutritional supplement was demonstrated by rigorous studies,” said Nathalie Piccardi, of Laboratoires Inneov, who worked on the study.  “The next step is to present this product to dermatologists,” she told Reuters Health, noting it has already been launched in Europe and South America.  But a closer look reveals some shaky science, said Dr. Peter Schalock, a dermatologist at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston who isn’t affiliated with Laboratoires Inneov.  “Scientifically there are no data there,” he said about one of the company’s experiments. “It sounds like opinion and nothing more.”  NO DIRECT COMPARISONS  The only published data on the tanning pill’s ability to reduce sunburns came out last month in the British Journal of Dermatology. To test the pill, scientists had dozens of women expose their behinds or backs to strong UV light. They found an effect on immune cells in the skin, but the question was, would the women also get fewer sunburns and better tans?  To answer that, Laboratoires Inneov conducted a so-called randomized controlled trial — the most powerful kind of study in the scientific toolbox — in which women were randomly assigned to take Inneov Sun Sensitivity or a placebo pill.  But the researchers never compared the response directly between the two groups, the whole point of a randomized controlled trial. Instead, they used a weaker method comparing the before-and-after differences within each group.  While Piccardi said she thought this method was appropriate, it means the company can’t claim women taking their product had a higher threshold for sunburns than those taking a placebo pill. The same goes for the tan.  As a result, said Schalock, the company’s claim that women taking their product can sunbathe with less concern of getting burned might be a stretch.  Schalock told Reuters Health he has a “hard time seeing that statistically or scientifically they have proven it.”  COMPANY FUNDED RESEARCH  The fact that the company did the testing itself could also raise a red flag.  “There is some evidence to indicate that we are right to be concerned about the quality of research when there is a conflict of interest,” said Josephine Johnston, a bioethicist at the Hastings Center in Garrison, New York.  Johnston, who said she could not speak to the scientific merits of the Inneov report, said other studies had shown industry-funded research is more likely to have positive outcomes, and that people could be influenced by financial interests even if they didn’t realize it.  “The major problem,” she told Reuters Health, “is that it has an impact of trustworthiness.”  Branding personal care products with clinical claims is a very common strategy, an expert who studies consumer marketing told Reuters Health.  “Claiming that kind of a benefit is certainly something people respond to,” said the expert, a professor at an East Coast university who asked to remain anonymous because his institution receives funding from the cosmetics industry.  While some people will want to see and feel an impact, he said, for many the clinical claim alone suffices. “The key question is, will the consumer view as credible that ingesting a pill will prevent (sun) damage?”  WHAT DID SKIN DOCTORS FIND?  In another experiment, Laboratoires Inneov scientists gave the tanning pill to 80 women and asked them to sunbathe as they normally would over the summer, applying sunscreen at their discretion.  Then they asked dermatologists, recruited by a company paid by Laboratoires Inneov, a series of questions about how these women fared. According to the report, the dermatologists told Laboratoires Inneov the product prevented sunburns.  “We truly believed that this kind of study, taking into account consumers’ opinion, complements experimental and control studies,” said Piccardi.  But the study did not answer a number of questions: How did the women usually do in the summer? Did they end up like boiled lobsters or were they careful not to get burned? Might they have been extra cautious because they were part of a skin protection study?  “It 	0

"Kim Painter  Special to USA TODAY  Spring has barely sprung, but in most of the country, spring allergy season — triggered by the first stirrings of tree pollen — is well under way.  You can tell by the sniffles and sneezes of the afflicted. But you can also tell by the ads: TV spots selling remedies for drippy, congested noses, itchy eyes and other symptoms are in heavy rotation.  New this year: ads for Flonase, a nasal steroid spray from GlaxoSmithKline that just became available over the counter. It joins Sanofi's Nasacort, a spray in the same class that went from prescription to over-the-counter status a year ago. And they both sit on store shelves next to antihistamines such as Claritin, Allegra and Zyrtec that were prescription drugs just a few years ago. Older over-the-counter antihistamines, such as Benadryl, and decongestants, such as Sudafed and Afrin, remain available as well.  Don't expect the ads to help you sort out what might work best for you. Here's what some top allergists say you need to know about these non-prescription options.  Believe (some of) the hype about the newly-accessible steroid nasal sprays.  These drugs work by fighting inflammation and they are in the ""single most effective drug class"" for treating nasal allergies, according to the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology. Other expert groups have made similar statements. ""These are first-line treatments"" that can prevent allergy symptoms, not just treat them, says Jackie Eghrari-Sabet, an allergist in Gaithersburg, Md.  But that does not mean they work for everyone, says James Sublett, a Louisville allergist and president of the allergy group. People with mild to moderate symptoms have the best chance of full relief, he says.  Possible side effects include nasal irritation and nose bleeds. Labels caution that some children using the sprays may experience slower growth, so a doctor should be consulted if a child needs them for more than two months.  Expect to pay more.  When prescription drugs are first available over the counter, most consumers end up paying more, because their insurers no longer cover the cost. The non-prescription steroid nasal sprays are selling for about $17 to $23 for a one-month supply (at the typical two-squirts per nostril adult starting dose). Worth knowing: so far, insurers have continued to pay for similar prescription sprays, Eghrari-Sabet says. The various sprays have never been studied head to head, so it's impossible to say whether they vary in effectiveness, she says.  There's a right way to use these sprays.  They should be used daily during your vulnerable season or seasons, ideally starting before symptoms do, Eghrari-Sabet says. The idea is ""to turn an army of inflammatory cells around before they recruit more soldiers,"" she says.  It's also important to administer the sprays correctly, so that they end up inside your nasal passages, not just your nose, where they might cause irritation, Sublett says. Packages contain instructions, and Sublett has an added tip: bend over and look at your toes while holding the bottle up and squirting.  Antihistamines still have a role.  These drugs target histamine. That's a chemical your body releases, causing sneezing, a runny nose and itchy eyes, when you come in contact with allergy-triggering substances. Antihistamines work faster than the steroid sprays, which can take a week or so to reach full effectiveness. They also can be cheaper, because they are available in store-brand versions. For example, Walmart sells Equate loratadine tablets (the same active ingredient as Claritin) for about $7 for 60 24-hour doses  Antihistamines make perfect sense for someone who suffers a few sneezy days each season and doesn't want to use a spray for weeks or months, Eghrari-Sabet says. Look for one that does not make you sleepy, Sublett says. It's a myth, he adds, that older, sedating antihistamines, such as Benadryl, are extra effective against nasal allergies.  Be careful with decongestants.  Decongestants such as Sudafed work by shrinking swollen blood vessels in the nose. They can raise blood pressure and cause jitters, and some people are more susceptible than others. Some decongestant sprays such as Afrin — unlike the steroid nasal sprays — can be used for just few days at a time, because they otherwise cause rebound symptoms.  So use these medications sparingly, Sublett says.  Keep your medical providers in the loop.  Over-the-counter treatments should not take the place of professional care — especially if you have never been formally diagnosed with allergies, if you have additional medical problems or if your symptoms persist or worsen, Eghrari-Sabet and Sublett say. An allergist can test you to find out what's causing your symptoms and offer additional treatments. Those include allergy shots and, for a few patients who qualify, newer immunotherapy pills that desensitize people to grass and ragweed pollens.  Also important to remember: While me"	0
"Kim Painter  Special for USA TODAY  Alex Pierce, 25, took up distance running with great enthusiasm a couple of years ago. Then she developed knee pain so severe that she could not climb stairs.  So Pierce, a doctoral student in food science, went to see physical therapist Matt Briggs at The Ohio State Wexner Medical Center in Columbus. He performed deep massages, suggested changes in her running form and taught her how to exercise her thigh and gluteal muscles to better protect her knees. She believes all of that helped.  But Pierce, like a growing number of patients, had another treatment she is convinced helped even more. It’s called ""dry needling,"" and it involves the insertion of thin, non-medicated solid needles into muscles or connective tissues. Proponents say it can reduce pain and improve movement. Pierce has had the procedure more than half a dozen times and believes it is one reason she will be able to run her fourth marathon in November.  “This has kind of changed my life,” she says.  Testimonials like that are a big reason dry needling has caught on with some physical therapists, athletes and other patients, Briggs says. But testimonials are not scientific proof.  And there, Briggs says, is where dry needling is lacking. While some studies have shown promise, he says, “the quality of the evidence is not strong.” That’s why Briggs and his colleagues are starting a study looking at dry needling in “runner’s knee,” the condition that has plagued Pierce. Their goal, and the goal of other researchers now looking at dry needling, is to produce results rigorous enough to show whether it really works.  For now, here’s what consumers should know:  Is this acupuncture?  Physical therapists say it is not, “though superficially, it may look the same,” says Justin Elliott, vice president of government affairs for the American Physical Therapy Association. For one thing, he says, dry needling as performed by a physical therapist is not rooted in ancient Chinese medicine — there’s no talk about redirecting the body’s energy flow by placing needles at certain points in the body. Instead, needles are placed directly in problem areas.  Elliott says dry needling also is practiced by some chiropractors, naturopathic physicians and nurses, which puts it outside the realm of any one specialty.  Acupuncturists beg to differ. “What is being called dry needling is clearly a form of acupuncture” and should be done only by professionals extensively trained in that discipline, says Thomas Burgoon, a West Chester, Pa., physician who is president of the American Academy of Medical Acupuncture. He says many acupuncturists do exactly what the physical therapists describe, with the same kind of needles.  Burgoon’s group has persuaded some states to bar physical therapists from the practice.    How might it work?  One theory is that the needles cause tight muscles to twitch, then relax. The needles may also increase blood flow or set off nerve responses that alter pain perception, Briggs says.  Another possibility: It’s a placebo effect, an improvement triggered by the expectation that a treatment will work rather than by the treatment itself. To look for that possibility, the Ohio State study will compare patients who get the real needle treatment to those poked with sham needles that don’t pierce the skin.  Mark Crislip, an infectious-disease doctor in Portland, Ore., who recently wrote about dry needling for Science-Based Medicine — a website critical of alternative medicine — says the version practiced by physical therapists doesn’t “come with the mystical baggage that accompanies acupuncture.” But he says it may well be a “theatrical placebo.”  What do published studies say?  “It’s a mixed bag,” Elliott says. In a 2011 review, the physical therapy association rated the evidence for dry needling a 3 out of 5, based on the best studies. A formal analysis of 35 trails on acupuncture and dry needling for chronic lower back pain was published by the Cochrane research group in 2005. It found they “may be useful” additions to standard treatment. But it said higher quality studies were needed.  What are the risks?  Needling can produce minor bleeding and some soreness, but in trained hands, and with the use of sterile needles and gloves, “it’s a very safe procedure,” Briggs says.  In rare cases, deep needling can lead to a punctured lung or injuries to nerves and blood vessels, and acupuncturists fear non-specialists will be more likely to make such mistakes, Burgoon says.  Will insurers pay for this?  Many will not. Charges for patients can range from $10 to $75 per session, says Edo Zylstra, CEO of KinetaCore, a company that offers intensive three-day weekend courses in dry needling to physical therapists.  Do all physical therapists offer this?  No. The physical therapy association tells members in seven states to steer clear because of recent court or regulatory decisions or language in existing licensing laws. They are: Cali"	0
"By Maureen Salamon  HealthDay Reporter  WEDNESDAY, Feb. 8, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Deep brain stimulation, a technique used to treat Parkinson's disease and certain psychiatric disorders, appears to provide some memory-enhancing benefits, researchers report.  Using electrical impulses to stimulate a part of the brain critical for memory function significantly improved patients' navigational ability, reflecting improved spatial memory, the small study from the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) suggests.  Although the results are still preliminary, the method may potentially hold promise for boosting memory in patients with early Alzheimer's disease, the researchers said.  ""The thing to bear in mind is that it's a first, important step,"" said Suzanne Haber, a brain researcher and professor of pharmacology and physiology at University of Rochester Medical Center in New York, who wasn't involved in the study. ""I think it was exciting that they were really able to show that stimulating that area was important for a certain kind of learning. It raises more questions, and many more experiments that can be done.""  Seven patients awaiting possible surgery for the seizure disorder epilepsy had electrodes implanted in their brains to pinpoint the origin of their convulsions. The researchers followed them and found they were better able to recognize landmarks and to navigate routes more quickly in a video game featuring a taxi cab, virtual passengers and a cyber city. Patients played the role of cab drivers who picked up passengers and delivered them to one of six requested shops in the city.  Stimulation of the entorhinal cortex -- a region considered crucial to transforming daily experience into lasting memories -- produced the improvement, the researchers said.  The study is published Feb. 9 in the New England Journal of Medicine.  During the video game task, participants learned their way around a virtual town with and without five-second periods of deep brain stimulation, and were tested for their ability to reach predetermined landmarks. Six patients showed a 64 percent reduction in ""excess path length"" -- the ideal path between destinations, which indicated better performance -- for locations that had been learned during periods of deep brain stimulation.  For five patients, navigation to each of the three stores learned during stimulation was faster and shorter than navigation to the three stores learned without stimulation, indicating a consistent effect, the study said. Stimulating the hippocampus -- a brain region next to the entorhinal cortex which helps form and store memories -- produced no effect during this experiment, however.  ""Critically, it was the stimulation at the gateway into the hippocampus, and not the hippocampus itself, that proved effective,"" senior study author Dr. Itzhak Fried, a professor of neurosurgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, said in a university news release.  ""Our preliminary results provide evidence supporting a possible mechanism for enhancing memory, particularly as people age or suffer from early dementia. At the same time, we studied a small sample of patients, so our results should be interpreted with caution,"" Fried added.  Currently, deep brain stimulation is used to control the tremors associated with Parkinson's, symptoms of obsessive-compulsive disorder and some other psychiatric conditions, including depression.  Haber noted that the brain damage that occurs with epilepsy, which can produce memory problems, is different than that resulting from Alzheimer's disease, in which the formation of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles are believed to contribute to nerve cell deterioration. So it's difficult to generalize this study's results to other diseases that affect memory, she said, and the research didn't show if effects of temporary deep brain stimulation last beyond the study period.  ""In these types of studies you think of things like this,"" Haber said, ""but how real it is, is something we're going to have to see. I think just trying to work out that there is some similarity in very simple learning [processes in the brain] is important.""

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Taking high doses of selenium may help slightly lower cholesterol levels — but it’s still not recommended in the United States, where most people get plenty of the mineral, according to the authors of a new study.  Still, the finding is “reassuring” because previous research had linked high selenium with higher cholesterol levels, said study author Dr. Eliseo Guallar, from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.  The picture of selenium’s health benefits — or possible health risks — has been anything but clear. Last week, a review of prior studies suggested that selenium probably doesn’t help prevent cancer, but might be linked to an increased diabetes risk at high doses (see Reuters Health story of May 11, 2011.)  “We don’t really know where we are,” Guallar told Reuters Health. “In a sense it’s a necessary micronutrient and we need it, but we might be (in) a situation where we have enough — we might even have too much.”  Selenium is found in meat, bread, and some nuts. It’s also available in supplement form, and costs about $2 for a month’s supply.  The Institute of Medicine recommends U.S. adults consume 55 micrograms of selenium per day.  Guallar and his colleagues wanted to look specifically at the link between selenium and cholesterol. They recruited about 500 older adults in the UK to take one of three different doses of selenium daily — 100, 200, or 300 micrograms — or a placebo pill with no selenium.  Researchers measured participants’ cholesterol levels at the beginning of the study and after six months on the selenium supplements or placebo. Their results are published in Annals of Internal Medicine.  Participants had an average starting cholesterol of about 230 milligrams per deciliter of blood. A healthy cholesterol level is less than 200 mg/dL, according to the American Heart Association, while 200 to 239 mg/dL is considered “borderline high.”  In the groups taking 100 and 200 micrograms of selenium daily, total cholesterol dropped an average of 8.5 mg/dL and 9.7 mg/dL, respectively, compared to the group taking a placebo pill.  Taking the highest dose of selenium was not linked to decreases in total cholesterol — but it was the only dose associated with an increase in HDL (“good”) cholesterol.  The authors reported no serious side effects associated with selenium during the study.  While Guallar said the results are “good news” in showing that high selenium intake is probably not a risk for high cholesterol, he wanted to add a note of caution.  The finding “is not generalizable to other patients,” he said. “In a population like the U.S. where selenium levels are adequate, there’s no reason to take extra selenium in supplements.”  The question of the link between selenium and health outcomes, Guallar said, “is a very interesting story that’s still developing.”  SOURCE: bit.ly/atTzv0 Annals of Internal Medicine, online May 16, 2011.	0

"(CNN) -- Losing interest in sex would be unfortunate for most people, but for Linda Poelzl it was a professional hazard.  ""I just wasn't feeling much interest in sex, and this was very disturbing to me,"" says Poelzl, who lives and works in San Francisco. ""I have to have a certain amount of interest in it because of my work.""  Poelzl's describes her work as a ""sex educator and coach,"" helping men, women, and couples work through their sexual problems. She says she usually possesses a great lust for lust, but then her libido started dissipating a few years ago when she was in her late 40s.  Shocked and not quite sure what to do, she turned to medical doctors, and found there wasn't much they could offer, as there's no prescription medicine like Viagra to help a woman when her sex life gets stuck. The greatest hope for a so-called ""female Viagra"" was a drug called flibanserin, but it was nixed by a panel of Food and Drug Administration experts on Friday, who said the drug didn't seem to really help women with sexual dysfunction.  This was the second time a so-called ""female Viagra"" failed to make it on the market; in 2004, an FDA panel said no to Intrinsa, a testosterone patch meant to hormonally help women with a lack of desire for sex.  Given these two rejections, it could be a while before another pharmaceutical company decides to sink money into developing a new drug for women with sexual problems. One company, BioSante Pharmaceuticals, hopes to bring a testosterone gel to the market in 2012, but there aren't many other products on the horizon.  ""There hasn't been much action in this area, and that certainly has to come up when a company is thinking about dumping money into researching a drug for female sexual dysfunction,"" says Phyllis Greenberger, president of the Society for Women's Health Research, which received money from Boehringer Ingelheim, the company that makes flibanserin.  That's despite a seeming need for such medication. In 2008, a survey of more than 30,000 U.S. women in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology found that nearly 40 percent reported that they'd had a sexual problem at some point in their lives, most often a lack of desire.  After seeing medical doctors but getting few results, Poelzl decided to take another route. She visited alternative practitioners and began experimenting with Taoist exercises used in Chinese medicine. She practiced six minutes of exercises every morning, such as sitting quietly in a chair massaging her lower abdomen.  While there's no hard science that shows that Taoist practices will improve a woman's sex life, Poelzl says it worked for her.  ""I noticed I started feeling more energy in my body, and more libido,"" she says. ""But it took at least six weeks of almost daily practice. You have to be committed.""  In fact, for nearly all alternative practices there are no large-scale studies saying if they work or not. But in the absence of a drug to help women with sexual problems, here's what's recommended by some practitioners.  1. Acupuncture  Jill Blakeway, a licensed acupuncturist who practices in New York City, started out doing acupuncture to help women get pregnant. But then a few years later she started noticing something interesting.  ""After having a couple of kids, patients were coming back to me and saying, 'I just never feel like it anymore,'"" Blakeway says.  She then developed a specialty in acupuncture to help women lift their flagging libidos. She says acupuncture, like Viagra, increases blood flow to the genitals, but unlike Viagra, it usually takes four to six weeks to see results.  ""If your sexuality has been lying dormant for a while, then it's going to take a while to wake it up,"" Blakeway says. ""And when it does wake up, I tell women not to see this as goal-oriented orgasmic sex, but rather as a way of connecting to their partner.""  One of Blakeway's patients wrote an article for the magazine, Cookie, about her experience with acupuncture for her flagging sex life.  To find an acupuncturist near you, go to the website of the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine and check off ""Chinese Herbology Certification.""  2. Chinese medicine  Blakeway says she often has success combining acupuncture with Chinese medicine. To find a practitioner familiar with Chinese medicine, go to the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine  Blakeway says between acupuncture and Chinese medicine, she's able to help about 65 percent of the women who come to her with sexual problems.  3. Maca  A root vegetable grown in high elevations in the mountains of Peru, animal studies have shown that maca increases sex drive. It's widely marketed in Peru as an aphrodisiac, where it's sold in several forms, including capsules and powdered form.  Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital are studying maca in women with sexual dysfunction.  Here's more information on the sexual effects of maca from New York Universi"	1
"Enlarge Handout photos Whether you stick to low-carbohydrate meals like the beef and vegetables, left, or low-calorie meals like the ""light"" spaghetti and meatballs, right, you can lose weight, researchers say. SUGGESTIONS FOR STICKING TO ANY WEIGHT-LOSS PLAN SUGGESTIONS FOR STICKING TO ANY WEIGHT-LOSS PLAN Set weight-loss goals. An initial goal of 5% to 10% is recommended by health experts because that amount is associated with improvements in medical conditions, such as diabetes, and most people can achieve it. After this is achieved, another goal can be set. Aim for a reasonable weight loss of one to two pounds a week. Keep track of all foods and beverages you consume. Studies show dieters who keep a record of their intake lose twice as much weight as those who don't. Track weekly physical activity, including type, duration and frequency. Try to do at least 200 minutes a week of moderate physical activity such as brisk walking. Keep in mind that long-term weight control is based on regular patterns of eating that avoids extremes and deprivation. The plan is not a diet but a lifestyle. Source: Gary Foster, director of the Center for Obesity Research and Education at Temple University in Philadelphia Is it low carb — or is it low fat? Here's what a new two-year study has found In the battle between a low-carb diet and a low-calorie, reduced-fat plan, the best weight-loss plan is — either one. A large study, released Monday, shows both diets produce similar weight loss and improvements in many health measures. 'NEW ATKINS': Digesting the facts on the low-carb diet LOW-CALORIE: Easy recipes for breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks DIET SELECTOR: Which plan is right for you? The finding comes after years of debate over whether low-carb plans, such as the Atkins diet, are safe and effective long-term. Such diets slash the consumption of breads, pasta, potatoes, rice, cakes, cookies and some fruits and starchy vegetables while beefing up protein. Nutrition experts have long favored a more conventional diet, which reduces the overall amount of calories and fat and while allowing a wide variety of foods. To compare the two types of diet plans, researchers at three major medical centers tracked the weight loss of more than 300 obese people for two years. Half of participants followed a low-carb diet, consuming about 20 grams of carbohydrates a day for three months, then gradually increased their carb intake over time. (Carbohydrate intake varies by individual, but typically people consume 200 to 400 grams a day.) The other half of dieters followed a low-calorie, low-fat diet of 1,200 to 1,800 calories a day, depending on their weight and gender, with less than 30% of calories from fat. Everyone exercised, kept track All dieters were encouraged to be physically active. They started out with 10 minutes a day of exercise, most of it walking, four days a week and then worked up to at least 50 minutes a day four days a week. Participants in both groups were taught behavioral skills such as setting reasonable weight-loss goals, keeping track of what they ate, recovering from episodes of overeating, reversing small weight gains, sticking with a regular program of physical activity such as walking, and steering clear of places and activities associated with overeating. The study, paid for by the National Institutes of Health and published in Tuesday's Annals of Internal Medicine show that dieters on both plans: •Lost an average of 11% of their starting weight, or roughly 24 pounds, after one year. •Lost and kept off about 7%, or roughly 15 pounds, at the end of two years. •Had similar changes in total cholesterol, blood pressure, percentage of body fat and bone density, but those in the low-carb group had about two times better improvements in their good (HDL) cholesterol than people in the low-fat group. You can do well on either of these diets if you make practical changes that help you stick to the program, says the study's lead author, Gary Foster, director of the Center for Obesity Research and Education at Temple University in Philadelphia. ""People think high-this, low-that. It's a lot of mental gymnastics,"" he says. ""What they should do is pick a plan they can stick with and then spend their attention on strategies that help them adhere to that plan."" He highly recommends writing down all foods and beverages you consume, which has been shown to be effective in short-term and long-term weight loss, he says. He also advises limiting the places and activities associated with overeating. And he tells people to be specific about the changes they are going to make. For instance, instead of vowing ""I'm going to cut fat,"" say, ""I'm going to eat low-fat popcorn instead of potato chips at night."" Or instead of saying ""I'm going to exercise more,"" say ""I'm going to walk while my son is at soccer practice three days a week,"" he says. ""What we say to patients is 'Plans work better than platitudes.' "" Foster says the study also show"	0
"En Español  By Dennis Thompson  HealthDay Reporter  FRIDAY, Jan. 21, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Americans suffering from muscle pain are used to taking a pill or rubbing in a cream to help soothe their aches.  But a new form of pain relief seems to be catching on: analgesics delivered through a medicated patch placed directly where it hurts.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the country's first over-the-counter, pain-relieving transdermal patches in 2008. But the patches, marketed under the brand name Salonpas, are nothing new. They've been sold in various countries in Asia since the 1930s, according to their manufacturer, the Japanese firm Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical.  ""Salonpas is the Western world catching up with Asia,"" said Dr. Rick Rosenquist, a professor of anesthesia and director of pain medicine at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine and chairman of the American Society of Anesthesiologists' committee on pain medicine.  ""If you are an Asian kid, you've had these placed on you since time immemorial,"" he said. ""It's just now starting to hit more mainstream in the United States. They're gaining more acceptance.""  Before the FDA action, pain-relieving patches were available in the United States only by prescription, said Dr. John Dombrowski, director of the Washington Pain Center in Washington, D.C. Their active ingredients include such medications as lidocaine, capsaicin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. The active ingredients in Salonpas are methyl salicylate and menthol, common components of pain-relieving gels and creams, such as Bengay.  Pain patches have a number of benefits, Rosenquist and Dombrowski said, not the least of which is convenience. With a patch, you ""put [it] on and forget about it, rather than having to remember to take pills,"" Dombrowski said.  The patches also deliver their medicine directly to the site of a person's pain. This may eliminate some of the side effects that come with taking pills. For instance, some analgesics are likely to cause an upset stomach unless they're taken with food. ""Obviously, patches get around that,"" he said. ""It's a very clever way of getting the medications right where they need to be.""  And, because patches release their medication slowly into the body through the skin, people also should get more consistent pain relief than they do with pills.  On the other hand, people have to be sure to carefully follow instructions for using the patches, to avoid overdose.  The main downside to pain patches, however, apparently comes from their effect on the skin. Some people may find themselves allergic to either the active ingredient in a patch or the adhesive used to keep the patch on the body.  ""You need to pay attention when you put them on, to see if you have any kind of skin reaction to the compounds that are contained in the patch,"" Rosenquist said.  Both doctors said that they expect more over-the-counter pain patches to hit the market if the popularity of Salonpas continues to grow. Future over-the-counter options, they predicted, could include reduced-dosage versions of the NSAID-delivering patches now available through prescription.  ""Success begets success,"" Dombrowski said. ""If this does very well, other drug companies will say, 'I want a piece of this action.'""

"Dec. 2, 2011 (Chicago) -- An experimental approach in which penile nerve tissue is frozen to knock out overactive nerves helped men with premature ejaculation last three times longer.  Researchers tested the technique on 24 men who hadn't been helped by standard treatments. They lasted an average of 110 seconds before ejaculation, or nearly two minutes, over the three months they were followed, compared with 36 seconds before treatment.  ""That's about what you see with standard drug therapy,"" says researcher J. David Prologo, MD, assistant professor of interventional radiology at Case Western Reserve University’s School of Medicine in Cleveland. A time to ejaculation of more than two minutes is normal, he tells WebMD.  Its supporters say the technique, or a similar one involving heat therapy, could someday become a standard treatment for the condition.  But other experts tell WebMD that questions about the long-term consequences remain. Also unknown: whether men would opt for the treatment.  The findings were presented here at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America. Prologo consults for Galil Medical, which funded the study."	0
“Bariatric surgery is probably the most effective intervention we have in health care,” says Laurie K. Twells, a clinical epidemiologist at Memorial University of Newfoundland. She bases this bold claim on her experience with seriously obese patients and a detailed analysis of the best studies yet done showing weight-loss surgery’s ability to reverse the often devastating effects of being extremely overweight on health and quality of life.  “I haven’t come across a patient yet who wouldn’t recommend it,” Dr. Twells said in an interview. “Most say they wish they’d done it 10 years sooner.” She explained that the overwhelming majority of patients who undergo bariatric surgery have spent many years trying — and failing — to lose weight and keep it off. And the reason is not a lack of willpower.  “These patients have lost hundreds of pounds over and over again,” Dr. Twells said. “The weight that it takes them one year to lose is typically back in two months,” often because a body with longstanding obesity defends itself against weight loss by drastically reducing its metabolic rate, an effect not seen after bariatric surgery, which permanently changes the contours of the digestive tract.  In reviewing studies that followed patients for five to 25 years after weight-loss surgery, Dr. Twells and colleagues found major long-lasting benefits to the patients’ health and quality of life. Matched with comparable patients who did not have surgery, those who did fared much better physically, emotionally and socially. They rated themselves as healthier and were less likely to report problems with mobility, pain, daily activities, social interactions and feelings of depression and anxiety, among other factors that can compromise well-being.	0
With calcium, adolescent girls may be the only group that is getting too little, the panel found. Older women, on the other hand, may take too much, putting themselves at risk for kidney stones . And there is evidence that excess calcium can increase the risk of heart disease, the group wrote.  As for vitamin D, some prominent doctors have said that most people need supplements or they will be at increased risk for a wide variety of illnesses, including heart disease, cancer and autoimmune diseases.  Photo  And these days more and more people know their vitamin D levels because they are being tested for it as part of routine physical exams.  “The number of vitamin D tests has exploded,” said Dennis Black, a reviewer of the report who is a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco .  At the same time, vitamin D sales have soared, growing faster than those of any supplement, according to The Nutrition Business Journal. Sales rose 82 percent from 2008 to 2009, reaching $430 million. “Everyone was hoping vitamin D would be kind of a panacea,” Dr. Black said. The report, he added, might quell the craze.  “I think this will have an impact on a lot of primary care providers,” he said.  The 14-member expert committee was convened by the Institute of Medicine, an independent nonprofit scientific body, at the request of the United States and Canadian governments. It was asked to examine the available data — nearly 1,000 publications — to determine how much vitamin D and calcium people were getting, how much was needed for optimal health and how much was too much.  The two nutrients work together for bone health.  Bone health, though, is only one of the benefits that have been attributed to vitamin D, and there is not enough good evidence to support most other claims, the committee said.  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  Some labs have started reporting levels of less than 30 nanograms of vitamin D per milliliter of blood as a deficiency. With that as a standard, 80 percent of the population would be deemed deficient of vitamin D, Dr. Rosen said. Most people need to take supplements to reach levels above 30 nanograms per milliliter, he added.  But, the committee concluded, a level of 20 to 30 nanograms is all that is needed for bone health, and nearly everyone is in that range.  Vitamin D is being added to more and more foods, said Paul R. Thomas of the Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health. Not only is it in orange juice and milk, but more is being added to breakfast cereals, and it now can be found in very high doses in supplement pills. Most vitamin D pills, he said, used to contain no more than 1,000 international units of it. Now it is easy to find pills, even in places like Wal-Mart , with 5,000 international units. The committee, though, said people need only 600 international units a day.  Photo  To assess the amounts of vitamin D and calcium people are getting, the panel looked at national data on diets. Most people, they concluded, get enough calcium from the foods they eat, about 1,000 milligrams a day for most adults (1,200 for women ages 51 to 70).  Vitamin D is more complicated, the group said. In general, most people are not getting enough vitamin D from their diets, but they have enough of the vitamin in their blood, probably because they are also making it naturally after being out in the sun and storing it in their bodies.  The American Society for Bone and Mineral Research and other groups applauded the report. It is “a very balanced set of recommendations,” said Dr. Sundeep Khosla, a Mayo Clinic endocrinologist and the society’s president.

But Andrew Shao, an executive vice president at the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade group, said the panel was being overly cautious, especially in its recommendations about vitamin D. He said there was no convincing evidence that people were being harmed by taking supplements, and he said higher levels of vitamin D, in particular, could be beneficial.  Such claims “are not supported by the available evidence,” the committee wrote. They were based on studies that observed populations and concluded that people with lower levels of the vitamin had more of various diseases. Such studies have been misleading and most scientists agree that they cannot determine cause and effect.  It is not clear how or why the claims for high vitami	0
March 5, 2012 (Orlando, Fla.) -- A traditional Chinese herbal remedy known as kampo helped to relieve daily asthma symptoms in nearly all of more than 200 people studied, Japanese researchers report. North American allergy experts tell WebMD that although they find the preliminary findings fascinating, further study is needed before they would recommend the herbs. Yoshiteru Shimoide, MD, head of the Yoshiteru Shimoide Clinic of Internal Medicine in Kagoshima City, Japan, presented the results here at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, & Immunology (AAAAI).  Asthma on the Rise in U.S. The number of people in the U.S. with asthma is growing. One in 12 people had asthma in 2009, compared with 1 in 14 in 2001, according to the CDC. There is no cure, but most people can control their symptoms, reduce the severity of their disease, and prevent asthma attacks by avoiding asthma triggers and correctly using prescribed medicines, such as steroid inhalers, the CDC says. There's much room for improvement, Shimoide says. He says it was accidentally discovered that kampo herbs could wipe out symptoms in many people while testing the ancient remedy against an allergic skin disorder known as atopic dermatitis. So his team studied 278 people with asthma who suffered daily symptoms of the disease. Of those, 52 were given standard treatment (typically an inhaled steroid and a bronchodilator), and 226 were treated with kampo herbs. Symptoms completely disappeared in 94% of patients taking kampo herbs after an average of 16 days, Shimoide says. In contrast, about three-fourths of those taking standard asthma medications still had daily wheeze and other symptoms.	0
Getty Images  A study shows that not all good fats are the same when it comes to protecting your health.  For decades, the message about fats has been relatively simple — reduce the amount of oils and fats you eat from animal and dairy products (less red meat and cheese) and substitute them with healthier fats from plants or fish (olive oil, omega-3 fatty acids). The difference came down to the specific type of fats that make up these foods — animal and dairy fats tend to be saturated, which means all of the free bonds available in a chain of carbon atoms are bound to hydrogen atoms, while plant fats are unsaturated, meaning some of carbon atoms have double bonds with each other. Saturated fats are more likely to build up within artery walls and form plaques that can trigger heart attacks.  But in the latest study on fats published in the BMJ, researchers found convincing evidence that not all plant fats are created equal and that linoleic acid, or omega-6 fatty acids, may be associated with a higher risk of early death from any cause, as well as increased risk of heart disease and death from heart-related conditions.  The study is actually a reanalysis of data that had not been included in the original publication of results from the Sydney Diet Heart Study, a trial that was conducted from 1966 to 1973. For more than three years, researchers at the time followed 458 men aged 30 to 59 years old who had a history of heart disease; about half were told to replace the saturated fats they consumed from animal and dairy sources with omega-6 linoleic acid, which is commonly found in safflower oil or margarines made from it. The other half were not told to change their diet in any way. When that study was published in 1978, researchers noted an increased risk of early death from any cause among the omega-6 group, but did not break down the data by what caused the deaths.  (MORE: Study: ‘Good’ Fats Even Better for the Heart Than We Thought)  So Dr. Christopher Ramsden, a clinical investigator at the National Institutes of Health, who was interested in understanding the effects of linoleic acid on heart health, contacted one of the original authors and reviewed data that had not been included in the study. This information involved deaths from heart-related causes, and the new analysis showed that the omega-6 group had a 17% higher risk of dying during the study period from heart disease, compared with 11% among the control group.  The American Heart Association (AHA) currently recommends that people replace 25% to 35% of their daily saturated-fat intake with foods containing unsaturated fats, such as canola and olive oils. The AHA further breaks down the unsaturated-fat advice by suggesting that people devote about 5% to 10% of their daily calories to foods containing linoleic acid. The recommendation is based on a review of the available data.  (MORE: Study: Eating Omega-3s May Help Reduce Alzheimer’s Risk)  The latest results, however, raise questions about that advice. Ramsden says the findings provide some refined understanding of unsaturated fats, which come in different chemical forms that may have varying benefits or risks. “I wouldn’t necessarily say that the [current advice] is necessarily completely wrong,” he says. “What happened is that in the 1960s all polyunsaturated fats were considered the same. They were grouped together under one mechanism of being able to lower blood-cholesterol levels. Then, over the ensuing decades, it became clear as science progressed that there were multiple types of polyunsaturated fats, and these compounds potentially have distinct biochemical and health effects.”  There has been some evidence to suggest that omega-6 fatty acids, for example, may trigger inflammation, a condition that is linked to an increased risk of heart problems, while omega-3 fatty acids, found in deepwater fish like salmon, tend to inhibit inflammatory reactions. Ramsden says the results highlight the need to study dietary ingredients in more detail, rather than lumping them together and assuming they have the same effect on the body.  (MORE: Can Olive Oil Help Prevent Stroke?)  Recognizing that need, the AHA says it is considering re-evaluating all its dietary recommendations, and will make the issue of polyunsaturated fats part of this assessment. Reviewing the dietary advice as a whole is important, says Alice Lichtenstein, a spokesperson for the association, since changes in one area could have unexpected, and potentially harmful, effects on other eating habits. When health organizations advised people to lower their intake of saturated fats, for example, many replaced the fats with carbohydrates, which can increase risk of diabetes and lead to higher levels of another type of fat in the blood, triglycerides. “One of the things we learned is that we need to look at the whole picture,” says Lichtenstein. “Just looking at one individual component puts undue emphasis on that component, and may lead 	0
"En Español  By Amy Norton  HealthDay Reporter  MONDAY, Feb. 16, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Mindfulness meditation may help older adults get a better night's sleep, a small study suggests.  Researchers found that among 49 older adults with sleep problems, those who learned mindfulness practices started sleeping better within six weeks. In fact, they did better than their counterparts who were given conventional lessons on good sleep habits, the study authors said.  Experts said the findings, published online Feb. 16 in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine, are encouraging.  On average, the effects of the mindfulness program were comparable to what's been seen in studies of sleep medications and ""talk therapy,"" said study leader David Black, an assistant professor of preventive medicine at the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles.  According to Black, that means older adults can feel comfortable opting for ""mind-body"" practices as a way to address moderate sleep problems. But he also emphasized the structured nature of the program tested in his study.  ""From our results, it is worth a try to engage in a structured mindfulness-based intervention led by a certified teacher with extensive experience,"" Black said.  In general, ""mindfulness"" practices encourage people to focus their attention on the present moment, instead of the past or future, and to take an objective look at their thoughts and emotions.  Sleep problems, Black explained, both affect and are affected by the mind. When people have difficulty sleeping, they often start to worry about it -- and that anxiety can worsen their sleep problems. On top of that, poor sleep itself can lead to psychological ""distress,"" such as depression symptoms, Black said.  ""There is a cyclical pattern here between wakefulness, sleep disruption, worry and mood,"" he said.  By learning ""non-judgmental mindful awareness,"" Black said, people can begin to see their thoughts and feelings without reacting to them. In basic terms, it helps them relax -- a ""necessary prerequisite"" for sleep, Black noted.  For the current study, his team recruited 49 older adults with ""moderate"" sleep problems, based on their answers to a standard sleep-quality questionnaire. It asked a range of questions -- including whether the person had problems falling asleep or staying asleep, had difficulty breathing at night, or felt drowsy during the day.  Black's team randomly assigned the participants to six weekly sessions of either sleep ""hygiene"" education or mindfulness training.  The mindfulness group learned different meditation techniques, as well as how to eat and move with more attention. The program, Black said, did not specifically address sleep -- a topic that might only stir anxiety in people who are already worried about a lack of sleep.  By the end of the study, the mindfulness group was showing a significant improvement -- shaving about three points, on average, from their scores on the sleep-problem scale. The group that received standard education lowered their scores by an average of 1 point.  The mindfulness group also showed greater improvements in depression symptoms and daytime fatigue, the investigators found.  Black said the benefits of mindfulness training were on par with what's been found in studies of sleep medications and cognitive behavioral therapy -- a form of ""talk therapy"" that is often helpful for insomnia, for example.  ""Cognitive behavioral therapy is highly effective,"" said Adam Spira, an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health in Baltimore.  The problem, Spira said, is that behavioral therapy for sleep problems is not always easily found -- and even when it's available, the process takes some effort.  ""What I found most interesting about this [mindfulness] approach is that it's a non-drug option, and it's accessible to the community at large,"" said Spira, who wrote an editorial published with the study.  Classes in meditation are available in many communities, and there are books, websites and CDs where people can learn mindfulness techniques. (The course Black's team studied is available online, at url  The caveat, according to Spira, is that this study tested that specific program. There is no guarantee that the course at your local senior center or a book would have the same chances of working.  Still, Spira said, it's a promising approach to older adults' sleep problems -- and one that's needed. ""We definitely need a whole menu of treatment options,"" he said.  One major reason is that sleeping pills, the most common current treatment, are temporary fixes at best. Plus, Spira said, they can have side effects that are particularly dangerous for older people -- such as dizziness and balance problems that can lead to falls, and problems with attention and memory.  Then there's the fact that sleep issues become common as people age, Spira said. Studies suggest that about half of adults age 55 and up have insomnia or some other sleep"	0
NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - People who took a newer type of pain pill over a three-year period were less likely to develop polyps that could lead to colorectal cancer — but at the expense of a higher risk of heart problems, new study findings report.  And when participants stopped taking the pain pill Celebrex (celecoxib) out of concerns over side effects, they eventually developed more polyps than people who had remained on an inactive, or placebo, drug throughout the study.  So should people concerned about their risk of colorectal cancer consider Celebrex?  “The findings in this study don’t necessarily make that decision any easier,” said Dr. Andrew Chan of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, who did not participate in the research.  The study, published in the American Journal of Gastroenterology, received financial support from Pfizer, which sells Celebrex.  This is not the first study to suggest Celebrex and similar drugs — known as COX-2 inhibitors - may reduce the risk of developing colon cancer, he said, but people need to balance that potential benefit with the higher risk of cardiovascular complications.  As a result, he said he suspects most people would choose to rely on regular colonoscopies to catch the disease in its early stages, rather than take a potentially risky drug for years.  But to people who have no underlying cardiovascular problems and a particularly high risk of colon cancer - they were diagnosed with it before perhaps, or have a strong family history - regular screening may not be enough, Chan noted.  “So for those patients, they might consider taking a drug like this,” he said.  Colorectal cancer is the third most common cancer in men and women, and strikes 1.2 million people each year.  Other research has provided signs that COX-2 inhibitors, which block the COX-2 enzyme that causes inflammation, could also prevent colorectal cancer, as well as lung cancer in heavy smokers.  However, most COX-2 inhibitors ran into safety issues a few years after their approval, and now only Celebrex remains on the U.S. market. At a cost of several dollars per day, depending on dosage, it is much more expensive than older pain relievers such as ibuprofen.  During the study, Dr. Nadir Arber of Tel Aviv University and his colleagues reviewed data collected from 1,561 people with a history of colorectal cancer. More than half had received Celebrex for approximately 3 years, before concerns over the increased risk of cardiovascular problems caused researchers to discontinue the study.  The scientists then followed the people willing to continue the research for another 2 years, noting who developed new polyps, including advanced polyps with features that suggest they’re more likely to become cancerous. Approximately half of the people who started the study agreed to continue.  Not surprisingly, Celebrex users were more likely to develop cardiovascular problems, including a 66 percent higher risk of serious cardiac disorders. But over the total 5-year period, people who took Celebrex were also less likely to develop new and advanced polyps than people who took a placebo.  Specifically, new polyps were found in 58 percent of people on placebo, and only 51 percent on Celebrex.  However, during the 5th year of the study alone, after the trial had been over for 2 years, 27 percent of Celebrex users developed new polyps, versus only 16 percent of people who had been on placebo - translating to a 66 percent higher risk among those who previously took Celebrex. Those who had been on Celebrex were also more likely to develop advanced polyps during that final year.  This rebound in risk actually makes biological sense, Chan told Reuters Health. If COX-2 inhibitors protect against colon cancer by blocking an enzyme pathway, when that blockage is released, the disease could occur “potentially at higher levels than had you never been on the drug in the first place,” he said.  Still, the results are “very promising,” Arber told Reuters Health by e-mail, adding he is now working to identify people who could benefit from the drug without experiencing the side effects.  Only half of the people who originally agreed to participate in the study remained after 5 years, and it’s unclear how this might affect the results, noted Chan, whose own research suggests aspirin could prevent deaths from colorectal cancer.  However, for a study that lasts this long, “those are acceptable numbers,” noted Arber.  If patients asked him whether they should take celecoxib to prevent colorectal cancer, Arber would tell them “no,” he added. “They should speak with their doctor.”  SOURCE: bit.ly/mDNurd The American Journal of Gastroenterology, online April 19, 2011.	0
LONDON (Reuters) - Men who have a certain genetic variations that put them at higher risk of prostate cancer may benefit from regular screening for the disease, a study by British scientists found Friday.  The findings suggest that by narrowing the focus of prostate cancer screening to those whose genes put them at most risk, doctors would catch more cancers early as well as reducing the potential for costly and damaging overdiagnosis.  “Although these are early results, it appears that (prostate cancer) screening is reasonably accurate at predicting potentially aggressive prostate cancer among men at higher risk of the disease due to a genetic predisposition,” said Ros Eeles, who led a research team from Britain’s Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and Royal Marsden hospital.  The study found that the predictive value of screening these men — expressed as the number of cancers detected relative to the number of tissue samples taken — was 48 percent, far higher than the 24 percent achieved in population-wide screening.  Screening for prostate cancer is controversial because the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests used cannot differentiate between men with aggressive cancer and men who would never have symptoms or need treatment, and this can lead to overdiagnosis.  A study in the United States last year found that routine prostate cancer screening had resulted in more than a million being diagnosed with tumors who might otherwise have suffered no ill effects from them.  The ICR-led study is aiming to find out whether screening men who have genetic variants that increase their prostate cancer risk could lead to earlier diagnosis. It aims to screen 1,700 men for five years, but results from the first 300 men were published in the British Journal of Urology International.  Genetic factors that increase prostate cancer risk include inheritable variations in genes known as BRCA1 and BRCA2.  Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide and kills 254,000 men a year. U.S. doctors routinely recommend PSA screening in men over 50 on the assumption that early diagnosis and treatment is better than doing nothing.  But fears about overdiagnosis, which can lead to treatments such as surgery, radiation or hormone therapy that can cause serious side-effects such as impotence and incontinence, have so far dissuaded many European countries from nationwide screening.  The men in this study — 205 with confirmed BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and 95 who had tested negative for the mutations — were all offered annual PSA blood testing, and 24 who had raised PSA levels were given a follow-up biopsy.  Eeles said the findings added to the increasing evidence that BRCA gene variation carriers develop more aggressive disease and supported the idea that men with genetic risks should be routinely screened for prostate cancer.	0
"Radiation From CT Scans May Raise Cancer Risk  Enlarge this image toggle caption Corbis Corbis  Doctors love the detailed pictures created by CT scans. Patients often expect a scan. But now researchers are warning that the radiation patients get each time computerized tomography is used to detect injuries and disease will cause thousands of extra cancers in coming years.  A new study from the National Cancer Institute projects 29,000 excess cancers from the 72 million CT scans that Americans got in 2007 alone. Nearly 15,000 of those cancers could be fatal.  CT-related cancers will impose a similar burden each year — unless the number of scans and the radiation dose-per-scan can be reduced.  ""Physicians [and their patients] cannot be complacent about the hazards of radiation or we risk creating a public health time bomb,"" says Dr. Rita Redberg, editor of Archives of Internal Medicine, which is publishing the paper in this week's issue.  Children, younger adults and women are especially susceptible. Two-thirds of the excess cancers will occur in women, the NCI researchers say.  Projected Future Cancers Possibly Related To CT Scans In U.S. Notes The bars indicate the projected average number of future cancers for each age range (95% uncertainty limits) that could be related to CT scans performed in the U.S. in 2007, according to age at exposure. The lower and upper values represent the possible margin of error from the mean estimate.  Wide Range Of Doses  A separate study in the journal documents needlessly high radiation exposures from CT scans at four San Francisco-area hospitals.  That study looked at actual radiation doses for 11 common types of CT scans in more than 1,100 patients. For the same body part, the doses varied enormously from one hospital to another and even within the same hospital. The researchers found a 13-fold range between the highest and lowest radiation dose.  It's often said that the radiation dose of a chest X-ray is comparable to flying across the continent. ... But a CT scan can be comparable to 500 transcontinental flights.  That means many unsuspecting patients are getting considerably more radiation than they need for an adequate CT image.  ""For the same body part, the same patient with abdominal pain being evaluated for possible cancer, there can be a profoundly different radiation dose,"" says Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman, a radiologist at the University of California at San Francisco who led that study.  Smith-Bindman says neither doctors nor patients appreciate the amount of radiation exposure that U.S. patients are accumulating from CT scans. The number of scans has increased at a rate of 10 percent a year recently, jumping from 3 million scans in 1980 to more than 70 million a year today.  ""It's often said that the radiation dose of a chest X-ray is comparable to flying across the continent,"" Smith-Bindman says, referring to natural radiation exposures at high altitudes. ""But a CT scan can be comparable to 500 transcontinental flights.""  She adds that a single CT scan can deliver about the same radiation dose that survivors of the atomic blasts at Nagasaki and Hiroshima endured.  ""I think we need to pause and think about whether the extra information [from CT scans] really helps us make a diagnosis,"" Smith-Bindman says. ""In most cases it does, and we should be using CT scanning in those cases. But in other situations it doesn't ... and the potential for harm outweighs the benefits.""  She says patients should start asking doctors if they really need a particular CT scan, and if so, whether it can be done with minimal radiation exposure. It's especially important for younger adults and parents to ask the questions.  Smith-Bindman says radiation exposures can be cut substantially by eliminating unnecessary CT scans — both initial scans and repeat or follow-up scans now often done routinely. Also some fancier CT studies, involving multiple ""slices"" through the body in a single examination, can be replaced by simpler CT tests, conventional X-rays or tests such as ultrasound or MRI that don't involve radiation.  Another way is to reduce the amount of radiation involved in each scan.  Sounding An Alarm  Dr. James Thrall, chairman of the American College of Radiology, agrees. He says at his institution, the Massachusetts General Hospital, doctors who order a CT scan or other imaging study must list the reason. A computer program feeds back an ""appropriateness score."" A low score indicates the test is unlikely to be necessary.  ""Our experience over the last five years has been rather phenomenal,"" Thrall says. Instead of an annual growth rate of 12 percent in CT scans, it's now about 1 percent, lower than the hospital's annual growth in patient load. ""That means we're doing fewer scans per person,"" he says.  To cut down on unnecessarily high radiation doses, Thrall says, the College of Radiology is also developing an ""alarm"" system that will alert hospitals when their CT scan exceeds an"	0
"By Steven Reinberg  HealthDay Reporter  WEDNESDAY, May 3, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- A new study finds that people with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who haven't done well on other treatments may find relief with Xeljanz (tofacitinib), a drug currently used to treat arthritis.  Ulcerative colitis is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease. It affects about 700,000 Americans, according to the Crohn's and Colitis Foundation (CCF).  The illness causes inflammation, irritation, swelling and sores on the lining of the large intestine. Symptoms include diarrhea with blood or pus and abdominal discomfort, according to CCF.  ""There is still a substantial unmet need for new treatments for patients with ulcerative colitis,"" said study lead author Dr. William Sandborn. He is professor of medicine and chief of the division of gastroenterology at the University of California, San Diego.  Xeljanz targets certain proteins involved in the body's inflammatory and immune responses that other so-called biologic drugs don't, the researchers said.  ""Treatment with oral tofacitinib is potentially a new treatment option for patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis, pending review by the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration],"" Sandborn said.  The study was funded by Pfizer, Inc., the maker of Xeljanz. Sandborn said he has received research grants from the company and served as a consultant for Pfizer.  Whether Xeljanz should be used as a first treatment is still not clear, said Dr. Arun Swaminath, director of the inflammatory bowel disease program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.  Because Xeljanz comes as a pill, it could have an advantage for patients, Swaminath said. But so far it has only been tried with patients who have not responded to other treatments, he said.  ""How it is used in the real world may be different than how it was used in these studies,"" Swaminath said. ""I am not going out on a limb and say this should be the first choice, because we don't have enough data to say that's the way it should be positioned.""  The researchers randomly assigned more than 1,700 people with ulcerative colitis to one of three phase 3 trials.  The first two trials looked at more than 1,100 patients with moderate to severe ulcerative colitis who had failed with conventional treatment or treatment with newer ""tumor necrosis factor antagonist"" drugs, such as Remicade (infliximab). They received Xeljanz or a placebo twice a day for eight weeks.  In the third trial, nearly 600 patients who responded to Xeljanz were assigned to a maintenance dose (one group with 5 milligrams [mg] and another group with 10 mg) of the drug, or placebo for a year.  In the first trial, nearly 19 percent of the patients taking Xeljanz experienced a remission of their condition in eight weeks. That compared to just 8 percent of patients receiving placebo.  In the second trial, almost 17 percent of those taking Xeljanz had a remission, compared with nearly 4 percent of those taking placebo, the researchers found.  In the third trial, more than 34 percent of patients taking 5 mg of Xeljanz had disease remission after one year. Forty percent of those taking a 10-mg dose of the drug had remission at a year. Only 11 percent of patients on placebo saw a remission.  However, in all of the trials, more patients taking Xeljanz suffered from infections, such as shingles, than those receiving placebo, researchers found.  In addition, five patients taking Xeljanz developed nonmelanoma skin cancer, compared with one patient receiving placebo. Five patients taking the drug experienced heart problems compared with no one on the placebo.  Also, compared with placebo, Xeljanz was associated with an increase in levels of cholesterol.  The report was published May 4 in the New England Journal of Medicine.  Dr. Sonia Friedman is an associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School. She's also the author of an editorial accompanying the study.  ""Tofacitinib is a promising new class of medical therapy that has efficacy in ulcerative colitis. It is an oral, small-molecule drug that is different from current biologic therapies, such as infliximab [Remicade], adalimumab [Humira], golimumab [Simponi] and vedolizumab [Entyvio],"" Friedman said.  An advantage of Xeljanz is that it is a pill. Other biologic drugs are given by infusion or injection. In addition, patients cannot develop antibodies to Xeljanz as they can with other biologic drugs, Friedman said.  ""Tofacitinib may be used in the future as rescue therapy from failure of biologics,"" she said. ""Only future studies will determine whether it can be used as initial therapy for ulcerative colitis and what patients it would help the most.""

"Feb. 10, 2011 (Los Angeles) -- Giving clot-busting drugs to people with mild strokes could prevent more than 2,000 of them from becoming disabled each year, researchers say.  A stroke occurs when a clot cuts off blood flow to parts of the brain. Those parts of the brain soon start to die. A drug called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) dissolves clots and restores blood flow.  Mild strokes -- characterized by such symptoms as clumsiness in the hand, weakness of an extremity, some slurred speech, temporary loss of vision, and/or dizziness -- account for more than half of strokes in the U.S.  But people with mild strokes are typically denied tPA because the studies that established its effectiveness excluded mild cases, says Pooja Khatri, MD, of the University of Cincinnati.  It's been assumed that people with mild strokes ""generally [do] well and the risk of tPA treatment, which includes a slight but significant risk of life-threatening bleeding in the brain, would not be worth the benefit,"" she says.  In fact, one in three people who suffer a mild stroke are disabled three months later, Khatri says."	0
An analysis of two influential studies of prostate cancer screening concludes that the much-debated test “significantly” reduces deaths from the disease, suggesting that current recommendations against routine PSA screening might be steering men away from a lifesaving procedure.  The analysis, published Monday in Annals of Internal Medicine, drew wildly different reactions, as is often the case with research on PSA screenings. Some experts in cancer screening and statistics said its novel approach was “on shaky ground” and used a “completely unverifiable” methodology that they had “never seen before,” but others praised its “intriguing and innovative approach.” There was one area of agreement, however: “I imagine it’s going to generate some buzz,” said biostatistician Ted Karrison of the University of Chicago.  If the new analysis is correct, one of the influential PSA studies, called PLCO, reduced deaths from prostate cancer by 27 percent to 32 percent, not the zero percent that PLCO researchers themselves found. For a man in the U.S., the risk of dying of prostate cancer is about 2.5 percent. A mortality reduction of 30 percent would lower the death rate to 1.75 percent, said epidemiologist Ruth Etzioni of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, the study’s senior author.  advertisement  “If a screening test reduces cancer mortality by 20 percent, it’s considered a successful test,” Etzioni said. “I think the [prostate-cancer] mortality reduction we calculate is a significant benefit. This is a screening test that saves lives.”  Newsletters Sign up for Cancer Briefing A weekly look at the latest in cancer research, treatment, and patient care. Please enter a valid email address. Privacy Policy Leave this field empty if you're human:  Those gains come at some cost to health, though: For every life saved, she estimated, five men will be told they have cancer when in fact their abnormal cells would never grow, spread, or harm them. In other estimates, such “overdiagnoses” outnumber lives saved by 50-to-1.  The new study lands amid another shift in how experts view PSA screening, which measures blood levels of a molecule sometimes associated with prostate cancer. In 2012 the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, whose recommendations help determine that procedures insurance should cover, recommended against routine PSA tests because of their many risks and tiny benefits. Among other drawbacks, the tests lead to overdiagnosis (meaning a biopsy finds malignant cells but they are so innocuous they would never harm, let alone kill, the man) as well as incontinence and impotence from treatment (including of harmless cancers).  In April, however, the task force proposed instead that men aged 55 to 69 discuss PSA’s pros and cons with their doctor and then decide what to do, factoring in that if 1,000 men get regular PSA screening for a decade it will save about one life. (Older and younger men are still advised not to have routine screening.)  The rationale for the re-analysis led by Etzioni is that the PLCO study was a bit of a mess. It assigned half of its nearly 77,000 participants, men ages 55 to 74, to have yearly PSA tests and the other half to not do so. But 46 percent of the men in the no-PSA group had yearly PSAs anyway. As a result, when researchers counted deaths in each group, it wasn’t a clean comparison: Rather than comparing screened to unscreened men, they were comparing assigned-to-screening men to not-assigned-to-screening men.  The finding that assigned-to-screening men were no more likely to avoid death from prostate cancer might therefore have been because their screening behavior wasn’t different enough from the “unscreened” (but in fact partly screened) men’s, not because PSA screening doesn’t save lives.  In an effort to untangle that possibility, Etzioni and 21 co-authors from 10 countries created multiple mathematical models. They all rely on estimates of “lead time,” or how much sooner a cancer is detected because of PSA instead of because symptoms are detected. The models incorporated the records of all the PLCO men and ignored which group they’d been assigned to.  Bottom line: Screened men’s cancers were detected earlier than unscreened men’s, and more frequent screening advanced detection more. That moved some prostate cancers from too-advanced-to-treat to treatable, reducing prostate cancer mortality by 27 percent to 32 percent over 11 years, Etzioni and her colleagues conclude.  Researchers not involved in the study weren’t convinced. “The concern is that men in the no-screening group but who chose to get screened anyway might differ in important ways from men who stayed with no-screening,” Karrison said. They might be more health conscious or conscientious, or have other traits associated with longevity. If so, then those traits, not screening, might be responsible for their lower risk of dying from prostate cancer. Two prominent experts in cancer prevention and statistics agreed, but	0
"latimes.com/news/science/la-he-statins-20100809,0,934659.story  By Melissa Healy, Los Angeles Times  August 9, 2010  Advertisement  As the world's most-prescribed class of medications, statins indisputably qualify for the commercial distinction of ""blockbuster."" About 24 million Americans take the drugs — marketed under such commercial names as Pravachol, Mevacor, Lipitor, Zocor and Crestor — largely to stave off heart attacks and strokes.      An article in Monday's Health section on the effectiveness of statins said that the drugs appeared on the American pharmaceutical landscape in the late 1990s. The first statin, lovastatin, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for marketing in 1987 and appeared on the U.S. market the same year.At the zenith of their profitability, these medications raked in $26.2 billion a year for their manufacturers. The introduction in recent years of cheaper generic versions may have begun to cut into sales revenues for the brand-name drugs that came first to the market, but better prices have only fueled the medications' use: In 2009, U.S. patients filled 201.4 million prescriptions for statins, according to IMS Health, which tracks prescription drug trends. That's nearly double the number of prescriptions written for statins in 2001, four years after they arrived on the American pharmaceutical landscape.But in recent months the drugs' touted medical reputation has come under tough scrutiny.Statins were initially approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of repeat heart attacks and strokes in patients with high cholesterol who had already had a heart attack. And used for that purpose — called ""secondary prevention"" — the drugs are powerful and effective medications, driving down patients' risk of another heart attack or stroke by lowering their levels of LDL (or ""bad"") cholesterol.Then physicians came to believe statins could also reduce the risk of a first heart attack in people who have high LDL cholesterol but are nonetheless healthy. This use of statins — called ""primary prevention"" — has driven the growth in the market for statins over the last decade.Today, a majority of people who use statins are doing so for primary prevention of heart attacks and strokes. It is this use of statins that has come under recent attack.""There's a conspiracy of false hope,"" says Harvard Medical School's Dr. John Abramson, who has cowritten several critiques of statins' rise, including one published in June in the Archives of Internal Medicine. ""The public wants an easy way to prevent heart disease, doctors want to reduce their patients' risk of heart disease and drug companies want to maximize the number of people taking their pills to boost their sales and profits.""Heart patients and their physicians are not the only ones to pin their hopes on statins. The drug companies that brought statins to the market have explored the medications' benefits in prevention or treatment of such conditions as Alzheimer's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, prostate and breast cancer, kidney disease, macular degeneration and diabetic neuropathy. Although clear proof that statins could forestall or treat any of these diseases might bring in millions of new, paying customers, results have largely been mixed, inconclusive or disappointing.In an ideal world, debate over the clinical virtues or vices of a drug would be long settled by the time the medication saw a meteoric rise in use. But in a healthcare system that relies on commercial incentives to spur drug development, prescription medications are a product like any other.The FDA assesses drugs' safety and effectiveness for specific use; but its judgments are based on preliminary data, most of it generated by a drug company seeking approval for its product. Once the agency approves a drug for marketing, the company that makes it will move quickly and aggressively to expand the universe of patients taking its product.Sometimes, by the time the deliberate pace of medical research and debate suggests that a drug is not all it's been cracked up to be, it's already become a bestseller. Statins, say some who study the relationship between medicine and the drug industry, seem to fit that pattern.Statins appear to drive down the risk of heart attack or stroke by lowering the levels of fatty deposits circulating in the bloodstream. Research suggests that the drugs dampen inflammatory processes that can prompt deposits of plaque to break away from blood vessel walls and cause sudden blockages of arteries leading to the heart or brain.And yet, the relationship between cholesterol-lowering and heart disease is not perfectly understood, and the precise role of inflammation in heart disease is also uncertain.Statins certainly decrease rates of heart attack in people who have clear signs of cardiovascular disease, but it's not so clear they work that way in people who are healthy. In spite of that uncertainty, statins' use for primary prevention "	0
Every year, many U.S. women get the grim news that they have breast cancer. In 2013 alone, according to the American Cancer Society, more than 230,000 were given that diagnosis. Each one very likely came as a devastating blow, both to the patient and to her family.  But what if some of these cases are preventable? What if there was a medication that could at least reduce a woman’s risk of developing breast cancer?  Such drugs already exist.  The Breast Cancer Prevention Trial published results in 1998 indicating that women who took one of those drugs, tamoxifen, were half as likely to develop breast cancer as similar women who did not take the drug.  Other medications, including raloxifene and a class of drugs called aromatese inhibitors, do much the same thing, though the Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved aromatese inhibitors for this use. Studies estimate that more than 2 million American women at high risk for breast cancer could benefit from taking a preventive drug.  A carton and individual 20 mg tablets of Tamoxifen, manufactured by Pharmaceutical company Wockhardt UK Ltd. (iStock)  But few women are opting for this protection, which goes by the name chemoprevention. A 2010 study found “exceptionally low” rates of usage.  In part this may be because many doctors are not even discussing this option with their patients. A small 2014 study in the Journal of Women’s Health found that only 13 percent of internal medicine, family medicine and gynecology physicians reported having recommended or prescribed these medications to women who might benefit from them.  The “low uptake of these medications is a missed opportunity,” says Heidi Nelson, a professor of medical informatics and clinical epidemiology at the Oregon Health & Science University in Portland. “Many high-risk women . . . could reduce their risks for invasive cancer by approximately 30 to 50 percent.” On the other hand, these drugs don’t suit everyone, and they are not without risks of their own. Because some of the side effects are serious — such as blood clots in the legs and in the lungs, and, in the case of tamoxifen, uterine cancer — only women who are deemed to be at high risk for the disease should consider them. But there are conflicting views on who meets that “high risk” definition  A bit about the drugs  Chemoprevention should not be confused with chemotherapy. Although both involve taking drugs, chemoprevention medications are taken with the goal of avoiding breast cancer altogether and the subsequent need for chemotherapy later.  And they work on the body differently. Chemotherapy kills off cells, healthy ones as well as cancercous ones. The chemoprevention drugs, by contrast, work by blocking estrogen, a hormone known to promote the growth of cancer cells in breast tissue. Chemoprevention drugs are called SERMs, or selective estrogen receptor modulators, and two have been approved specifically for breast cancer prevention: tamoxifen, which was developed to treat breast cancer after its onset and only later was found to have a preventive benefit, and raloxifene, which was designed to treat osteoporosis.  A 2013 study in the Lancet analyzed data for more than 80,000 women taking tamoxifen or other SERM drugs. The researchers found an overall 38 percent reduction in new cases of breast cancer 10 years after women took these drugs compared with women who took a placebo. The effect was even larger during the first five years of the study.  Investigators working for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an independent group of scientists and clinicians funded by the government, echoed these results. After looking at multiple trials of tamoxifen and raloxifene, the task force noted that these drugs reduced new cases of breast cancer significantly: from 23 cases per 1,000 women in the control groups to 16 cases per 1,000 women in the treatment groups.  Nelson, one of the lead authors of the analysis, is “confident” that these results show a true benefit. Others are more cautious.  Kenneth Lin, a family physician at Georgetown University who worked on developing the task force’s SERM guidelines, notes that while SERMs may have reduced new cases, they “have not been shown to reduce breast cancer mortality in any study or meta-analysis.” One possible explanation, he says, is that “these drugs are effective at preventing nonlethal cancers rather than the more serious ones.”  Not used enough?  Given that these drugs seem to offer some protection, why are they not in widespread use? Serious side effects is one reason. Beyond blood clots and uterine cancer, other known reactions to the drugs include strokes, cataracts, bone pain, hot flashes, nausea and vaginal dryness.  For some women, the risk of such side effects may be worth taking, depending on their particular odds of developing breast cancer. Those odds can be figured by using a commonly used calculator, often called the Gail model, that estimates a woman’s chances of hav	0
"Because of the widespread impact of high blood pressure, researchers are likely to investigate in some depth any simple dietary interventions that could potentially benefit the wider population.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), high blood pressure is either the primary cause of or contributes to more than 1,000 deaths in the United States every day.  Researchers have concluded that one glass of beetroot juice a day is enough to significantly reduce blood pressure in people with high blood pressure . They conducted a placebo-controlled trial with dozens of participants.  Medical researchers have recently returned to this plant product to investigate its effect on blood pressure and explore opportunities to put it to use in modern medicine and the home management of conditions.  Beetroot has been used since the Middle Ages as a treatment for ailments, particularly those relating to the blood and digestion.  If you buy something through a link on this page, we may earn a small commission. How this works.  High blood pressure is a serious public health concern. It increases the risk of more dangerous health conditions, such as heart attack, stroke, and chronic heart failure. High blood pressure is also a major risk factor for kidney disease.  Share on Pinterest Beetroot juice has been investigated for the powerful effect of its nitrate content on blood pressure.  Beetroot contains high levels of dietary nitrate (NO3), which the body converts into biologically active nitrite (NO2) and nitric oxide (NO). In the human body, NO relaxes and dilates blood vessels.  Other leafy vegetables, such as lettuce and cabbage, also have high levels of the compound. They take it up from the soil through their roots.  A meta-analysis of 16 trials was published in The Journal of Nutrition in 2013.  The researchers found that ""Inorganic nitrate and beetroot juice supplementation was associated with a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure.""  One major trial was carried out at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) in the United Kingdom and published in the journal Hypertension. The research was funded by the British Heart Foundation.  They found the following results:  ""This interesting study builds on previous research by this team and finds that a daily glass of beetroot juice can lower blood pressure in people with hypertension - even those whose high blood pressure was not controlled by drug treatment."" Dr. Shannon Amoils, British Heart Foundation, senior research advisor  For the trial, Prof. Amrita Ahluwalia of the vascular pharmacology department at QMUL and her colleagues recruited 64 people aged between 18 and 85 years.  Half of the participants were taking prescribed medication for high blood pressure but did not reach their target blood pressure, and the rest had been diagnosed with high blood pressure but were not yet taking medication for it.  The participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group consumed a 250-milliliter (ml) glass of beetroot juice, and the other group had the same, except their beetroot juice was nitrate-free.  The nitrate-free beetroot juice was the basis of the placebo group.  All groups consumed the juice daily for 4 weeks. They were also monitored for 2 weeks before and after the study, bringing the total trial period to 8 weeks.  The trial was double-blind, which means neither the administering clinicians nor the patients knew whether the beetroot juice they were given was the placebo or the active supplement.  During the 4 weeks in which they were taking the juice, patients in the active supplement group, whose beetroot juice contained inorganic nitrate, experienced a reduction in blood pressure of 8/4 millimeters of mercury (mmHg).  The first figure is systolic pressure, generated when the heart is pumping, and the second figure is diastolic pressure, created when the heart is relaxing and filling with blood. The 8/4-mmHg reduction brought the blood pressure of many participants back into the normal range.  In the 2 weeks after they stopped drinking the juice, their blood pressure returned to the higher levels noted at the start of the study.  This is the first study that shows evidence of dietary nitrate supplementation's long-lasting benefit in a group of patients with high blood pressure.  Share on Pinterest High blood pressure is a common health issue in the U.S., and beetroot juice acts as a natural aid.  The patients in the active supplement group also experienced a 20 percent or so improvement in blood vessel dilation capacity, and their artery stiffness reduced by around 10 percent.  Studies show that these changes are linked to a reduced risk of heart disease.  There were no changes in blood pressure, blood vessel function, or artery stiffness in the placebo group.  The authors note that the reduction achieved in the active supplement group is close to that achieved by medication. The average reduction in blood pressure "	0
"TUESDAY, May 4, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Noninvasive stool DNA testing can detect two types of colorectal precancers and could play a larger role in colon cancer prevention, say two new studies.  Compared with widely used fecal blood tests, stool DNA testing has higher detection rates for curable stage colorectal cancer and for common precancerous polyps (adenomas), according to the Mayo Clinic-led research teams.  The DNA stool test methods were developed at the Mayo Clinic. Some of the study authors and the Mayo Clinic have a financial interest related to technology used with this research.  The first study found that stool DNA testing detected five out of five cases of colon cancer and four out of five cases of a precancerous lesion called dysplasia in 10 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).  ""This study shows that cancer and precancer in IBD can be detected noninvasively,"" senior investigator Dr. David Ahlquist said in a Mayo news release. ""The 90 percent detection rate by stool DNA testing is remarkable. It's important for people with IBD because they are at much higher risk for colorectal cancer than the general population. Given the limitations of colonoscopies in detecting these lesions, stool DNA testing could play a complementary role to improve the effectiveness of cancer surveillance.""  In the second study, the researchers found that stool DNA testing had a success rate of 71 percent in detecting serrated colorectal polyps, compared to a 7 percent detection rate with fecal blood tests.  Serrated colorectal polyps, which are believed to be the forerunner in about 30 percent of colon cancer cases, can be difficult to detect using most types of colorectal cancer screening. Unlike common polyps, they tend to be flat and the same color as the colon lining.  The studies are slated to be presented on Monday and Tuesday at the annual meeting of the American Gastroenterological Association.  ""Detection of these important types of precancer by stool DNA testing offers promise in our efforts to more effectively and affordably prevent colorectal cancer. However, findings from both pilot studies need to be corroborated in larger studies,"" Ahlquist said.

"WEDNESDAY, June 15, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Reiterating a recommendation last made in 2008, an influential U.S. panel of health experts is advocating that regular colon cancer screening begin at age 50 and continue until at least age 75.  However, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force stopped short of saying any one screening method was better than another.  ""There are multiple screening options for colorectal cancer that reduce the risk of dying from the disease. We encourage people to choose the best option for them, in consultation with their clinician,"" former Task Force member Dr. Douglas Owens said Wednesday in a USPSTF news release.  The panel's reticence to choose one option over another may be at odds with the preference of many doctors, who often advise colonoscopy as the ""gold standard"" test.  Dr. Arun Swaminath is one of them.  ""There is only one test -- colonoscopy -- that can both diagnose a polyp/cancer and remove or sample it at the same time,"" said Swaminath, who directs the inflammatory bowel disease program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.  ""This is key, because a positive stool test plus stool DNA test (such as Cologuard), or a positive imaging test (such as CT colonoscopy) will still require a follow up colonoscopy to confirm and treat the problem,"" he explained.  For its part, the American Cancer Society recommends colonoscopy screening once every 10 years, beginning at age 50, or one of a number of other tests at more frequent intervals.  In drafting its updated colon cancer screening guidelines, the USPSTF reviewed data on several screening strategies. Besides colonoscopy, these included flexible sigmoidoscopy (an invasive procedure that penetrates less far than colonoscopy); CT colonography (a scan of the colon); traditional fecal occult blood tests (looking for blood in stool); and the recently approved Cologuard DNA-based stool test.  The panel said there were no comparison studies that suggested that any of the screening methods were any more effective than others. There are varying amounts of proof supporting the effectiveness of each, and each method has its advantages and limitations, the panelists said.  And what about colon cancer screening for the elderly?  In its statement, the panel said that ""for some adults ages 76 to 85, the benefits of screening are smaller, and the potential for harm greater. However, some people in this age group may benefit, especially if they have never been screened before and are healthy enough to undergo treatment if cancer is found.""  For this older group, the USPSTF recommends that decisions on screening be made during consultations between the patient and his or her doctor.  All of the recommendations are specific to symptom-free people 50 years of age or older with an average risk colorectal cancer, the panel stressed. People with disorders or medical histories that raise their odds for colon cancer may need more rigorous screening, the USPSTF said.  The updated recommendation was published online June 16 in the Journal of the American Medical Association.  ""Evidence convincingly shows screening for colorectal cancer works, but not enough people are taking advantage of this highly effective service,"" said Owens, a general internist at the Veterans Affairs Palo Alto Health Care System and a professor at Stanford University.  The USPSTF notes that only one-third of eligible adults in the United States are screened for colon cancer, and more need to take advantage of this effective method of prevention.  Colorectal cancer remains the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States. This year about 134,000 people in the country will be diagnosed with the disease, and about 49,000 will die from it., the panel said  The USPSTF is an independent, volunteer panel of experts that makes recommendations about the effectiveness of specific preventive health services.

"Older Patients Can Benefit From Lung Cancer Surgery  Enlarge this image toggle caption Michael Rubenstein for NPR Michael Rubenstein for NPR  Every year when Morton Pollner had his checkup, he worried that doctors would find something on his lung. For years, they didn't. Then his luck ran out.  ""My reaction was, 'Well, you smoked for 30 years. You got away with it for another 30 years and this is it.' I thought it was a death sentence,"" he says.  Pollner, who lives in Monroe, N.Y., was 76 when he was diagnosed with lung cancer. Like many patients his age, he didn't expect there would be any effective treatment. Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in men and women. And it is mainly a disease of older people. Only about 2 percent of lung cancer patients are under 45 and the average age at diagnosis is about 70.  Older patients are frequently not offered curative treatment like surgery, because they and their families and even their doctors often think they won't be able to tolerate it. So they are referred for supportive care to control symptoms, rather than surgery to remove the cancer.  Enlarge this image toggle caption Michael Rubenstein for NPR Michael Rubenstein for NPR  But many patients can survive and even thrive after surgery, says Dr. Prasad Adusumilli, a thoracic surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. He was senior author of a study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in October. The study looked at more than 2,000 patients with Stage 1 non-small cell lung cancer who had surgery to remove their tumor. About 70 percent of the patients were 65 years old or older and about 30 percent were at least 75.  And he found that a surprising number of these older patients did quite well. One year after surgery, more people had died from other causes than died from lung cancer. And, after five years, almost 9 out of 10 patients were alive and cancer free.  ""They did well and beat their lung cancer,"" Adusumilli says, proving that when it comes to surgery for early stage lung cancer, age should not be a limiting factor.  This was the case for Morton Pollner, who is one of Adusumilli's patients. His cancer had not spread, and Adusumilli told him there was a good possibility the cancerous tissue could be completely removed and he could go back to leading a normal life. That was seven years ago. Today, Pollner is 82, cancer free and enjoying life.  Enlarge this image toggle caption Michael Rubenstein for NPR Michael Rubenstein for NPR  ""Whatever I get from here on, it's like gravy,"" he says.  Surgery isn't the answer for all older lung cancer patients, according to Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. Patients with heart or other health problems may not be candidates. At the same time, he says it's important to recognize that patterns of aging have changed over the past two decades.  Seventy today is not the same as it was 20 years ago, Lichtenfeld says. Older adults are more functional, both physically and mentally, than ever before, and he says the medical community needs to adjust its thinking about what treatments older cancer patients can tolerate.  ""We shouldn't allow numerical age to be the deciding factor,"" Lichtenfeld says."	1
"Doctor Challenges Cause Of MS And Treatment  One day 7 years ago, after a long walk with his dog along the Hudson River in Manhattan, Marc Stecker noticed he was limping. Not long after, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.  ""Fast forward now, and my entire right side is pretty much paralyzed and my left side is weakening,"" Stecker says.  Enlarge this image toggle caption Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography/Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography/Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography  Stecker is now confined to a wheelchair, from where he writes a blog about his disease, called Wheelchair Kamikaze.  More than a year ago, Stecker started writing about a theory Italian physician Paolo Zamboni proposed in 2008 called chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency, or CCSVI.  It's been thought that multiple sclerosis is caused by a misguided immune system that attacks the nerves of the brain and spinal cord and can lead to muscle weakness, paralysis and death. However, Zamboni suggests that the disease instead is the result of blocked blood veins — leading to inflammation, which, in turn, causes the immune system to attack nerves in the brain and spinal cord.  Zamboni proposed that treating it may be as simple as opening them up. Stecker was hopeful.  ""Because my disease is so aggressive, I have been very willing to be equally aggressive in trying to combat it,"" Stecker says.  The 'Liberation Procedure'  To clear the veins, his doctor tried opening them with a tiny balloon. Zamboni calls it ""the liberation procedure"" but it is actually a common technique known as angioplasty when it's used to open clogged arteries — not veins.  A Brief History Of Multiple Sclerosis In 1822, Augustus D'Este, the grandson of England's King George III, began documenting his illness, which would one day be identified as multiple sclerosis. Since D'Este's day, researchers have learned how to better treat the disease, but have not yet found a cure. Here is a timeline of some key events along the way.  1868: Scientists identify multiple sclerosis as a distinct condition. 1878: Myelin, which insulates nerve fibers, is discovered. In MS, the body erodes the myelin, which damages nerve fibers and interrupts brain signals. 1916: Using a microscope James Dawson examines the brains of people who died from MS. He is able to describe in depth the damage done by the disease. 1969: Researchers use a hormone typically made by the pituitary gland to treat the symptoms of MS. 1981: The MRI is first used to help diagnose MS, reducing diagnosis time from seven years to six months after the first symptom. 1993: Doctors begin using a drug called Beta interferon 1-b to reduce disease flare-ups. 2008: Paolo Zamboni proposes the theory Chronic Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency. — From the National Multiple Sclerosis Society  ""At first, I was very skeptical. But anecdotal reports started coming through of almost miraculous results from it.…So, I decided, you know, hey it was worth a shot,"" Stecker says.  But it didn't work. Although the doctor who treated him in New York found a significant blockage, he was unable to correct it, Stecker says.  Still, some would say Stecker was lucky. Many desperate patients have spent their life savings flying overseas to have the procedure, only to have it fail a few months later. Others elect to have tiny metal tubes, known as ""stents,"" placed in the veins to hold them open and have suffered serious complications, including life-threatening blood clots. Several patients have even died as a result.  Stecker says if he had it to do over again, he would have waited for more research. But he says he was eager to try something that offered him the first real glimmer of hope for a cure.  ""CCSVI equals hope and a lot of MS patients just are completely devoid of hope,"" Stecker says. ""People don't want to have MS. They want to go back to who they used to be. You know, along comes this theory that offers an easy-to-understand solution, so it's very, very, very seductive.""  Growing Public Controversy    It's so seductive, in fact, that Canadians and Americans with MS have been flocking overseas to get the ""liberation procedure."" Something that many researchers find very troubling. Robert Zivadinov of the Buffalo Neuroimaging Analysis Center in New York says that not only is the procedure unsafe and costly to many patients, it is impeding necessary research.  Enlarge this image toggle caption Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography  ""Even if the treatment is not useful for patients with MS, I don't think that we can abandon the idea of vascular involvement in MS,"" Zivadinov says.

Eighteen years ago, math teacher Susan Tesone went from having perfect vision to being so visually impaired she wasn’t able to drive in just four weeks. Tesone, who is now 42, was diagnosed with Leber’s hereditary optic neuropathy which is a genetic disease that rapidly clouds a patient’s central vision.  Tesone, whose brother has the condition as well, told FoxNews.com that she sees “through a dense fog.”  “It’s not as though there is a big black spot. Your peripheral vision begins to take over,” she said, adding, “I get a whole image of a whole room, for example, but what I don’t have is clarity.”  Tesone didn’t allow the diagnosis to alter her life plans, and though she was saddened by the news, she was determined to live a successful and fulfilling life.  “You have to decide what accommodations you’re going to make for yourself in your home life and work life and figure them out,” she said.  Tesone began to utilize different tools, from talking computers to magnifiers that project images on to a large screen. These large and bulky gadgets served as a modest improvement to her life but it was her husband who found an item that she said makes her life much more efficient.  Her husband, a computer programmer, was attending a conference and heard about a device called the OrCam, which helps those who are visually impaired. He was able to get one for his wife so she can be part of the beta testing.  “OrCam is a portable intuitive smart camera that someone wears on their glasses,” Bryan Wolynski, an optometrist who promotes OrCam to doctors and trains patients on how to use the device, told FoxNews.com.  “It fits on their own right side temple of their glasses, takes a picture and then speaks to the wearer what it sees,” he said.  The camera, which is about the size of a lighter, is connected by a wire to a power pack that can fit in a pocket or purse. It is activated when a patient points at a subject, or presses a button on the power pack. The camera takes a picture and instantaneously reads what it sees. OrCam can read print on a newspaper or a piece of mail. It also can be trained to recognize a person’s face or any household object.  OrCam costs $3,500, but Wolynski believes the outcome worth the price.  “I have seen a person cry when being able to read for the first time in many years,” he said.  Another ophthalmologist, Dr. Marc Werner, also believes that OrCam is a useful device, but he said there are some drawbacks.  “It doesn’t always get every word exactly correctly, so if you’re reading a long book, it may not be the best way to do it,” he said, adding “but certainly there is nothing out there as far as I know that lets you read a newspaper or get the gist of the story even if it’s going to miss a few words or a few concepts, it’s still far better than what’s out there right now.”  Tesone agrees because of how much more efficient her life is now, both at work and at home. Reading one piece of paper on a magnifier could take her sometimes up to 20 minutes because she almost had to read letter by letter. Now, the OrCam takes about 30 seconds to read, scan and dictate the letter back to her.  “I have time at home with my children because I could just read something and be done. It’s just so amazing to be able to do,” Tesone said.  For more information about OrCam click here.	0
When roasted at 475 degrees, coffee beans are sometimes described as rich and full-bodied. But for the full-bodied person who is not so rich, unroasted coffee beans — green as the day they were picked — may hold the key to cheap and effective weight loss, new research suggests.  In a study presented Tuesday at the American Chemical Society’s spring national meeting in San Diego, 16 overweight young adults took, by turns, a low dose of green coffee bean extract, a high dose of the supplement, and a placebo. Though the study was small, the results were striking: Subjects lost an average of 17.5 pounds in 22 weeks and reduced their overall body weight by 10.5%.  If green coffee extract were a medication seeking approval from the Food and Drug Administration, these results would make it a viable candidate — more than 35% of subjects lost more than 5% of their body weight, and weight loss appeared to be greater while subjects were taking the pills than when they were on the placebo.  But as a dietary supplement, green coffee extract does not require the FDA’s blessing. In fact, it is already available as a naturopathic medicine and antioxidant.  Advertisement  Joe Vinson, the University of Scranton chemist who conducted the pilot study, said the findings should pave the way for more rigorous research on coffee bean extract’s effects. A larger trial involving 60 people is being planned.  Vinson, whose research focuses on plant polyphenols and their effects on human health, said it appears that green coffee bean extract may work by reducing the absorption of fat and glucose in the gut; it may also reduce insulin levels, which would improve metabolic function. There were no signs of ill effects on any subjects, Vinson reported Tuesday.  The study used a “cross-over” design, which allowed each subject to serve as his or her own comparison group. For six weeks, volunteers swallowed capsules three times a day, ingesting either 700 or 1,050 milligrams of green coffee extract a day or taking a placebo. After a two-week break, they moved, round-robin style, to another arm of the trial.  Subjects did not change their calorie intake over the course of the trial. But the more extract they consumed, the more weight and fat they lost. Altogether, they reduced their body fat by 16%, on average.  Advertisement  Of the 16 volunteers, six wound up with a body mass index in the healthful range.  One downside is that the extract is “extremely bitter.” It would be difficult to take without a lot of water, Vinson reported.  At roughly $20 per month, however, green coffee extract is much less expensive than any of the weight-loss medications available over the counter or by prescription.  The trial was conducted in India and paid for by Applied Food Sciences Inc. of Austin, Tex., a manufacturer of green coffee bean extract.  The pilot study drew strong cautions from several scientists who weren’t involved in the research.  “This is certainly a provocative study,” said Dr. Gerald Weissmann, a physician and biochemist at New York University. But he said nutrition experts would want assurances that green coffee beans do not cause “malabsorption” within the human gut — a condition that would lead to weight loss as well as malnutrition, heart arrhythmias and other problems because vitamins and minerals are not passing through the intestine.  Dr. Arthur Grollman, a pharmacologist at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, said coffee beans contain about 250 different chemicals — some with positive and others with negative effects on human health. Though Vinson identified polyphenols and chlorogenic acid as the agents that appear to promote weight loss, Grollman said that claim needed further study. In the meantime, he said, consuming an extract that contains both good and bad chemicals in dense concentration seems an unwise thing to do.  melissa.healy@latimes.com	0
The race to create the next potent ovarian cancer drug is coming to a head.  Ovarian cancer has historically been one of the harder cancers to treat — but a promising new class of drugs, called PARP inhibitors, is proving powerful in delaying the growth of tumors by preventing cancer cells from repairing themselves after they’ve been damaged by chemotherapy.  In recent days, the researchers behind three PARP drug contenders threw down preliminary data during the European Society for Medical Oncology conference in Denmark.  advertisement  Massachusetts-based Tesaro was the clear front-runner with its experimental once-a-day ovarian cancer pill, niraparib. Its results built upon exciting data it released in June — showing that its drug can increase the window of time in which a woman’s cancer doesn’t get worse. (The study did not assess whether the drug helped women live longer, just how long it stopped tumors from growing.)  A small pilot study on a drug called talazoparib, which is now owned by Pfizer (PFE), recently showed similarly compelling results.  But Colorado’s Clovis Oncology (CLVS) fared less well. Though its own PARP inhibitor, rucaparib, showed that it could help some women compared to chemotherapy alone, its data didn’t measure up to the other two trials. The company’s stock plunged 18 percent on Friday after the data were released.  One PARP inhibitor has already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration: olaparib, sold by AstraZeneca (AZN) as Lynparza. It’s being used to treat ovarian cancer in women who have already undergone chemotherapy.  Chemotherapy deals heavy damage to tumors — but often, the cancer cells are able to regroup and repair themselves. PARP inhibitors work by stopping this repair. They’re particularly useful in treating cancers associated with the BRCA mutation, since this gene codes for proteins that help repair damaged DNA.  While chemotherapy is still used as a first line of attack, PARP inhibitors are largely being studied as maintenance drugs. The hope is that they’ll keep cancer at bay once it’s been attacked by chemo.  A number of cancers are associated with BRCA mutations — including breast, prostate, and pancreatic.  More and more clinical trials will spring up to test PARP inhibitors in combination with other cancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, said Dr. Christina Annunziata, an investigator at the National Cancer Institute who studied the efficacy of Lynparza in ovarian cancer patients.  The field is so hot that over the summer, Pfizer agreed to spend an eye-popping $14 billion to buy San Francisco-based biotech Medivation. The key asset Pfizer wanted? The PARP inhibitor talazoparib. So far, there’s just extremely early data, but it looks promising. In a pilot study of 13 breast cancer patients on the drug at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, tumors shrank on average 78 percent.  “We found a significant decrease in the tumors with only two months of therapy,” said Dr. Jennifer Litton, the lead investigator. She’s launching a larger trial for further study.  As for Tesaro, it first shared initial data from a Phase 3 clinical trial this past June. It showed that patients with recurrent ovarian cancer treated with the drug got an extra 15 months without their disease getting worse, compared to a control group. At the European conference this weekend, Tesaro added a few more details to that data:  The study looked at 553 patients whose cancer responds to a certain type of chemotherapy, known as platinum chemo. The best results came from patients with the BRCA mutation: Their tumors didn’t start to grow again for 21 months, on average, compared to 5.5 months for a control group that just received a placebo. Other groups of patients treated with the drug also had significantly better outcomes than control groups.  The results were published this weekend in the New England Journal of Medicine.  A few weeks ago, the Food and Drug Administration granted Tesaro’s drug fast-track approval status — and this new data will support its registration applications to both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, Tesaro CEO Lonnie Moulder said. The company is now planning trials in lung cancer, and is considering other cancers to pursue.  “In the field, these would be described as landmark results,” Moulder said. “At this time, there’s nothing available that has been approved by regulatory agencies for these women who have recurrence to their ovarian cancer.”  By comparison, Clovis Oncology has floundered.  The company aims to use its PARP inhibitor, rucaparib, to treat only patients with BRCA mutations who have had two or more chemotherapies. But the data it presented at the European conference showed that the drug may not actually be more effective than Lynparza, the PARP inhibitor that’s been marketed by AstraZeneca since 2014.  The study’s lead investigator, Rebecca Kristeleit, defended the performance of rucaparib, adding that one can’t compare Clovis’s drug	0
(Reuters Health) - Waning eyesight may hasten the pace of cognitive decline in older people, suggests a U.S. study.  The results suggest that vision fixes, like a new eyeglass prescription or surgery to remove cataracts, can go a long way toward helping older people stay mentally sharp, said lead author D. Diane Zheng of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.  “Taking care of your vision is important in order to maintain good cognitive function,” she said in a telephone interview.  Poor eyesight and weakening mental function are common in older people and related to one another, but the question of whether vision influences cognition, or vice versa, has not been clear, the study team writes in JAMA Ophthalmology.  To investigate, Zheng’s team followed 2,520 adults for eight years, testing their vision and cognitive status every other year.  Over the course of the study, average visual decline was roughly equivalent to losing the ability to read one line of an eye chart. People who had worse vision at the beginning of the study had worse scores on the cognitive exam as well. A person’s vision at their previous check-up was related to their mental function at the following check-up. While mental function at one check-up was also related to vision at the following exam, the effect of vision on subsequent mental function was significantly stronger.  While the mechanism behind the vision-cognition relationship isn’t well understood, Zheng said, worsening vision can discourage people from brain-stimulating activities like doing crosswords and engaging with other people.  She recommended that older adults get regular eye checkups, and have any vision symptoms checked out and treated promptly.  “This study provides additional evidence that would suggest that people who can keep their vision healthy as they age might also be protecting their cognitive health,” said Dr. Heather E. Whitson of Duke University School of Medicine and Durham VA Medical Center, who wasn’t involved in the research.  “If you’re aging without good vision, not only are you giving your brain less stimulation, you might be altering your brain at a structural level,” she said in a phone interview.  The good news, Whitson added, is that poor vision is one of the few risk factors for cognitive decline that is potentially modifiable. Even incurable causes of age-related vision loss such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration “are highly treatable, so we can reduce the amount of vision loss that people suffer from if they’re detected early.”  SOURCE: bit.ly/2KNE36Y and bit.ly/2KKPqfN JAMA Ophthalmology, online June 28, 2018.	0
"Enlarge Handout The dietary supplement called Telomerase Activator TA-65 researchers believe may help reverse the aging process by lengthening telomeres (the caps on the ends of chromosomes that keep DNA intact as cells divide). HEALTH REPORTER TWEETS HEALTH REPORTER TWEETS A new study out this week suggests a dietary supplement from a Chinese plant may create changes on the ends of our chromosomes that help keep DNA intact, possibly boosting the immune system. The research, published in the scientific journal Rejuvenation Research, reports on a year-long study on a dietary supplement called Telomerase Activator TA-65, which researchers believe may help reverse the aging process by lengthening telomeres — the caps on the ends of chromosomes that keep DNA intact as cells divide. Shortened telomeres are linked with aging and a lowered immune response. But some aging and telomere experts are skeptical. The study raises more questions than answers, says Janko Nikolich-{Zcaron}ugich, chairman of the Department of Immunobiology and co-director of the Arizona Center on Aging at the University of Arizona College of Medicine. ""This study may be the basis for a fully controlled clinical trial,"" he says. But he says the study shouldn't be used to promote the supplement because it was not designed to test the body's immune response to it. But the study's authors believe the results are a positive reflection on the supplement's potential as an anti-aging compound. ""The key message in this study is that in individuals taking the novel telomerase activator supplement, after a one-year period, there was a reduction in production of cells with short telomeres,"" says study author Calvin Harley, CEO of Telome Health Inc., in Menlo Park, Calif., who says the study is funded by the product's maker, TA Sciences. The ongoing observational study included 114 people who took 5 to 10 mg a day of the supplement, derived from a dried Chinese root, Harley says. Some upped their dose to 25 or 50 mg a day over time without signs of adverse effects, Harley says. At the beginning of the study and at three-month intervals through the year, blood samples were drawn and dozens of tests were conducted on telomerase activation. ""Those data showed TA-65 activates telomerase roughly 2- to 3-fold,"" Harley says. He says the percentage of immune cells with short telomeres declined about 10% to 50% in most of the individuals tested, and there was a decrease in the number of aged immune cells of roughly 10% to 20%. ""The basic principle they put forward is if you activate telomerase — an enzyme — you'll have more telomeres and have longer function by protecting chromosomes. They show their activating compound had some effect on telomerase activity, but it wasn't great,"" says John Pascal, assistant professor of biochemistry and molecular biology at Thomas Jefferson University. But Pascal says telomere maintenance and research is certainly a valid area of scientific study. ""It's definitely a very pertinent topic because it seems to play a role in regulating how long the cell can continue to replicate and function normally,"" Pascal says. Frederick Vagnini, medical director of Heart, Diabetes and Weight Loss Centers of New York, says he has had as many as 20 patients on the supplement, including himself. ""I look at it as a cellular protectant and boosting immunity,"" says Vagnini, who says a drawback is that it can carry up to an $8,000 annual price tag, depending on daily dose. But others, including Alzheimer's disease expert Nilufer Ertekin-Taner, an assistant professor of neurology and neuroscience at the Mayo Clinic, suggest caution with studies of this type and note that the study should be considered preliminary. ""It could get peoples' hopes up and yet we have so little to work off of,"" Ertekin-Taner says. Guidelines: You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

"En Español  By Steven Reinberg  HealthDay Reporter  TUESDAY, July 20, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- The cancer drug Avastin, when used in combination with standard chemotherapy, is safe and can effectively treat an advanced form of one of the most common lung cancers, researchers report.  Previously it had been thought that this combination might have serious adverse side effects, including life-threatening bleeding, for patients with non-squamous non-small-cell lung tumors. However, this phase 4 trial, which used Avastin (bevacizumab) plus chemotherapy in a large population found these problems were minimal.  Phase 4 trials are done after a drug is on the market, to look for any new problems.  ""Today we have a new option to treat non-squamous lung cancer, incorporating Avastin in chemotherapy regimens and in maintenance therapy,"" said lead researcher Dr. Lucio Crino, director of medical oncology at S. Maria della Misericordia Hospital in Perugia, Italy.  ""The practical implication is the possibility to incorporate Avastin with any chemotherapy regimen in the frontline therapy of metastatic non-squamous lung cancer,"" he added.  The report, which is funded by the maker of Avastin, F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., is published in the July 20 issue of The Lancet Oncology. The funder was involved in study design, coordination of data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, and writing of the report, the journal noted.  Advanced non-small-cell lung cancer is a common cancer that kills 1.18 million people every year worldwide, according to background information in the study. Avastin is a so-called monoclonal antibody that works by blocking vascular endothelial growth factor A, which stimulates the growth of the tumor's blood supply.  When used as an adjunct to chemotherapy, Avastin had already shown cancer-fighting activity in two phase 3 trials, the researchers noted.  For the study, Crino's team studied Avastin in more than 2,200 patients with advanced or recurrent non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. The patients were treated at centers in 40 countries around the world.  These patients were given the drug every three weeks along with standard chemotherapy, for up to six cycles. Patients were then treated with Avastin alone until the cancer began to progress (""maintenance"" therapy).  The researchers reported few clinically significant adverse events, meaning that most were no greater than what one would expect in the general population. One percent of patients experienced bleeding in the lungs and 4 percent had bleeding, Crino's group found.  Overall, 3 percent of the patients died due to adverse events associated with Avastin. These included 1 percent who had blood clots and 1 percent who suffered bleeding.  Other serious adverse events associated with Avastin were blood clots in the lungs and nosebleeds, low white blood cell counts, fever along with a low white blood cell count and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), all of which occurred in 1 percent of the patients.  Dr. Robert Pirker, from the department of medicine at the Medical University of Vienna in Austria, and author of an accompanying journal editorial, said that Avastin ""can be safely given when certain precautions are taken.""  However, several issues remain to be determined, including the optimal dose and the role of maintenance therapy with Avastin, he said.  ""In addition, it is unknown whether bevacizumab [Avastin] increases survival when added to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer,"" Pirker said.  Overall, Avastin, like several other targeted agents have led to therapeutic advances in lung cancer, he added. ""Hurdles in clinical development do occur but -- as shown for bevacizumab -- can be overcome,"" Pirker said.  Another expert, Dr. Norman H. Edelman, chief medical officer at the American Lung Association, and professor of preventive medicine, internal medicine, physiology & biophysics at Stony Brook University in New York, called the study ""very good bread-and-butter clinical research.""  The efficacy of the drug has been proven previously, he noted, but this study provides an in-depth analysis of Avastin's safety profile under ""real life"" conditions, he added.  ""Too often this step is shortcircuited in the rush to market of a new drug and we have to await the laborious collection of after-market data to find the real dangers of many new drugs,"" Edelman said.  ""So, the researchers and sponsors are to be congratulated for doing this study. They find that there are real deleterious side effects but that they are manageable, and conclude the drug is worth using under the proper circumstances,"" he said.  Avastin is in the spotlight Tuesday for another reason, as well. U.S. regulators could rescind approval of the drug for the treatment of breast cancer, based on follow-up studies reported Friday that failed to show the medication shrank tumors or extended lives, according to published reports.

Yvonne Felix’s eyes don’t work well enough on their own for her to read, recognize faces or cross the street without help. But when the Toronto-based artist and mother puts on a new kind of camera-equipped headgear, she looks at me like no one has before.  The visor that allows legally blind people to see is no longer Star Trek fiction. Leaps in augmented-reality technology are being used to help people with severely low vision gain back enough sight to function, and then some.  Ms. Felix, who has Stargardt disease, wears a device from a company called eSight. The eSight 3—which weighs less than a quarter of a pound and is operated by hand-held remote—captures the world through a camera system and then displays it on OLED screens that sit very close to the eyes. Legally blind people like Ms. Felix have some limited vision, and eSight’s displays are tuned to make use of it. By dialing up contrast and allowing users to zoom in, it can dramatically amplify sight without a surgical procedure.  “Being able to see that people’s pupils actually dilate and contract is quite amazing,” she says. The gear has allowed Ms. Felix to get a desk job and travel on her own. She’s also become a spokeswoman for eSight.  Efforts to make noninvasive vision tech started decades ago with bulky TV-like devices that magnify and increase the contrast on books. In the 1990s, NASA developed space goggles with a camera and two black-and-white cathode-ray-tube screens.  To Star Trek fans, this system recalls the blind “Next Generation” series character who wore a vision visor. “I remember thinking that Geordi La Forge was my hero and that one day there would be something like that and when it came out, I wanted to try it,” says Ms. Felix, who is 36.  The eSight visor, in development for 10 years, is reaching a level of maturity. The third-generation, which debuts this week, weighs less, has a wider field of view and just looks cooler. ESight—along with other makers of head-mounted low-vision aids such as Orcam and Nu-Eyes—is taking advantage of tech that is cheaper, smaller and faster because of popular gadgets like smartphones and virtual-reality headsets.

The battery lasts about 6½ hours.  Using the hand-held controller, users can zoom and pan, like on a street sign, or plug in a TV feed directly. Because of those capabilities, Ms. Felix said in some cases eSight probably lets her see better than me.  “There is no device that’s a magic solution for all problems,” says Walter Wittich, an assistant professor at the University of Montreal’s School of Optometry, who is part of the first independent research project into the tech. Still, Mr. Wittich says it can be useful for the people with low vision who benefit from magnification, for whom most current options are hand-held.  Not everyone feels equally comfortable operating the gear. Mr. Wittich plans to release initial results from the study in May, and says one thing that is clear is that people who click with eSight immediately see a boost in quality of life. “It is working very well for some people already, and there is still quite a bit of potential in both the design and electronic capability,” he says.  ESight says its tech has worked for about three quarters of the people who have tried it. Their biggest hurdle is getting the technology paid for. They have sold about a thousand to date, and this new visor costs $10,000. While the device has FDA clearance as a Class I medical device, most insurance doesn’t cover it.  “That is a battle we are starting to wage,” says eSight Chief Executive Brian Mech. Some employers and other third parties have picked up the tab, he says, but the challenge is to reach users who have limited resources because their vision challenges keep them from work.  The eSight 3 handheld controller lets the user zoom in or pan across signs and other objects.

While the National Federation of the Blind estimates there are 1.3 million legally blind people living in the U.S., Mr. Dagnelie thinks at least a hundred thousand people could benefit from eSight’s tech.  For an artist like Ms. Felix, it has offered more than routine improvement. She worked for decades in sculpture and thick paint, because she felt her work as much as she saw it. Her favorite artist was Vincent van Gogh, because he also likely suffered from vision problems.  She recalls the first tim	0
