BREAKING: Darren Wilson named as officer who fatally shot #MichaelBrown in #Ferguson	2
#Breaking: The officer involved in the shooting of Michael Brown is named Darren Wilson, #Ferguson police chief says.	2
BREAKING: #Ferguson police chief just announced that officer Darren Wilson shot the unarmed teen, Michael Brown.	2
The name of the officer who shot #MikeBrown has been named. His name is Darren Wilson, a 6-year veteran of the #Ferguson police department.	2
URGENT: Darren Wilson is the police officer who shot Mike Brown http://t.co/RZ1eYcKpiY #Ferguson http://t.co/D2HyKchWvq	2
BREAKING - #Ferguson's police chief has announced Darren Wilson as the cop who shot and killed #MikeBrown. (not the guy named by Anonymous)	2
First, #MikeBrown was accused of shoplifting. Now, it's a robbery? It's very telling how the #Ferguson PD keeps spewing lie after lie.	2
BREAKING: #Ferguson police have identified Darren Wilson as the cop who shot and killed Michael Brown. More details to come...	2
BREAKING: #Ferguson police chief names Darren Wilson in killing of unarmed teen	2
JUST IN: #Ferguson police identify officer who shot Michael Brown http://t.co/ynEjjl1uD1	2
Question for #Ferguson police chief? If OFFICER DARREN WILSON was in pursuit of a robbery suspect, why tell kids to get out of the road? LIE	2
"That was very ""SLICK"" of the Police Chief to create a narrative that #MikeBrown was a ""suspect"" in a robbery!  #Ferguson"	2
Let's be clear, #Ferguson PD never said Officer Darren Wilson was responding to robbery call before contact w/ #MikeBrown until today.	2
Police name the officer who shot #Ferguson teenager #MichaelBrown. Watch: http://t.co/O76WptH1nE  http://t.co/R6bxjsY9CZ	2
7) #MikeBrown was approached for mouthing off to a cop (both  #Ferguson PD &amp; eyewitness testimonies reflect this). NOT as a robbery suspect	2
Darren Wilson is a six year veteran of the #Ferguson Police and had no disciplinary actions against him.	2
Because, of course, when someone commits a robbery they stroll down the middle of the street where everyone can see them. #Ferguson	2
REMINDER: #MikeBrown was a kid who just wanted to walk down a street. And for that, HE IS DEAD. Those are the facts. #Ferguson	2
today #MichaelBrown would've completed his 1st week of college &amp; #Ferguson police chief spent most time suggesting he's the criminal	2
"Police reports released this morning indicate Mike Brown was a suspect in a ""strong-armed"" robbery in #Ferguson"	2
Hold on while Chief Jackson sprinkles a little crack on that Mike Brown crime scene ... #Ferguson	2
#MikeBrown wanted to walk down the street. And he is dead. And the #Ferguson PD is using his silence in death to make him a criminal.	2
BREAKING NEWS: According to documents released to the press, #MikeBrown was connected to an earlier robbery #Ferguson http://t.co/LuCR9711S0	2
I personally don't trust St. Louis County PD, and I think they waited all this time to forge and falsify evidence. #Ferguson #MikeBrown	2
Oh, a suspect in a robbery? That changes everything. Everyone knows summary execution is the penalty for suspicion of robbery #Ferguson	2
Every time the police talk, their story changes. I hate it. #Ferguson	2

"So the angel Michael Brown who is 6'4"" 290 is the robber of the convenience store! #Ferguson http://t.co/d81cQPHzbi"	2
The surveillance tape the police have on TV DOESNT even look like anything near Canfield Green apts. #MIKEBROWN #Ferguson	2
The info given today seems to line up with this witness account, even the alleged theft: http://t.co/7hjBIrf1a3  #Ferguson #MikeBrown	2
If there is surveillance of a robbery why release stills and not the video itself? #Ferguson	2
#Ferguson police hand out info to make Michael Brown seem like a thug. But nothing on how he was actually killed, interaction with officer.	2
I'm NOT believing this story because I know how the police lie and will keep lying and will organize together AND LIE. #MIKEBROWN #Ferguson	2
It's not #MikeBrown in those #Ferguson police video stills. Not unless he changed his shoes after the robbery but before he met the officer.	2
If Dorian Johnson is a suspect in a robbery that justified #DarrenWilson killing #MikeBrown, why hasn't Dorian been arrested? #Ferguson	2
"""Police in #Ferguson, once charged a man with destruction of property for bleeding on their uniforms while four of them allegedly beat him."""	2
Update: #Ferguson police release stills from convenience store footage showing robbery http://t.co/rl0RgIphUp http://t.co/PHUofG7mJR	2
Bottom line: cops are supposed to use deadly force only when lives are at risk. You don't shoot robbery suspects. #Ferguson	2
So police narrative in #Ferguson is unarmed teen suspected in unarmed robbery was shot to death. We've still got a problem, Chief.	2
#Ferguson Police apparently has a history of fabrication.  http://t.co/x1d3QTfEBx	2
MORE: #Ferguson police chief identifies Darren Wilson as cop who shot Michael Brown http://t.co/Qojlgp8mlc http://t.co/mwZBmZjAst	2
Being shot 10 times in the street for stealing cigars is due process? No arrest. No trial. No conviction―just immediate execution. #Ferguson	0
the police version is also that #MikeBrown approached the officer. But if he had JUST robbed a store, why approach police?? #Ferguson	2
An observation from yrs in practice - if it takes you 5 days to get your story out &amp; it doesn't make sense, it's probably not true #Ferguson	2
.....for a cover-up to be successful....you must first discredit the victim.....  #Ferguson	2
And I feel silly for pointing this out but...  In America we don't have  executions by gunfire for alleged robberies. #Ferguson #MikeBrown	2
So lets recap. No dashboard cam of the incident. But definitely photos of Michael Brown in a store. Funny how that happens #NMOS14 #Ferguson	2
"Cops were extra aggressive to incite fear and cause chaos, giving the #Ferguson PD time to destroy and/or manufacture any ""evidence"" needed"	2
The police chief is a 5 star general in projection, imagination and deflection...took a week to hatch this theory #Ferguson	2
Just did a google map search. There are 2 Quick Trips in #Ferguson and they are on opposite ends of the town. Did #MikeBrown teleport?	2
basically #Ferguson PD did an opposition research dump on mike brown, and not their jobs	2
Did anyone think of comparing the clothes that #MikeBrown was wearing when he was laying on the street to the security footage? #Ferguson	2
In 2009 #Ferguson PD beat a black man, then charged him for getting blood on their uniforms http://t.co/Y1QTm1BZyt http://t.co/KcuZ5VFMOn	2
so #MikeBrown's hat disappeared and he changed into shoes right? #Ferguson http://t.co/2zu5sUH84S	2
so if he was with #DorianJohnson at the robbery why wasn't he in custody? All media outlets interviewed him before the police #Ferguson	2
The selective release of information by #Ferguson PD tells us nothing about the shooting. Instead appears to be a basic smear job.	2
Here's the police report. Somehow #Ferguson cops valued a box of Swishers at nearly $50. Time to stop smokin I guess http://t.co/8ZkvrHkApc	2
#Ferguson cops beat innocent man then charged him for bleeding on them: http://t.co/u1ot9Eh5Cq via @MichaelDalynyc http://t.co/AGJW2Pid1r	2
This is simple: IF #MikeBrown was a robbery suspect, why didn’t #Ferguson police say that on DAY ONE? Why wait six days?	2
#Ferguson PD releases robbery incident report smearing #MikeBrown but not shooting incident report. Did they think we wouldn’t notice?	2
These surveillance images were taken at a convenience store 10 min. Before #MichaelBrown was shot Sat. #Ferguson http://t.co/mnReDcRfzz	2
DARREN WILSON MURDERED AN UNARMED TEEN LEFT HIS BODY IN THE STREET FOR 4 HRS  Anything else is irrelevant. #MikeBrown #Ferguson #CoverUp	2
Let's not forget that even if Mike Brown did shoplift, that's not why police said he was stopped or why he was shot. #mikebrown #ferguson	2
So basically #Ferguson PD hijacked what was supposed to be a press conference about Darren Wilson to call Michael Brown a criminal #NMOS14	2
If Mike Brown was engaged in a robbery before being shot, why isn't his alleged accomplice under arrest? #Ferguson http://t.co/upMLU4bbK4	2
The surveillance photos, the police report, and this witness account. #Ferguson http://t.co/Sbx9tfA5FA http://t.co/JGgtaXYOxz	2
So in 5mins mike brown shaved his head and changed his scandals to shoes. I think your being lied too #Ferguson http://t.co/GSaYdYUhJr	2
Assuming #MichaelBrown and #DorianJohnson were involved in robbery, when can we expect President Obama's apology to the #Ferguson PD? #tcot	2
Looks like #Ferguson PD spent their whole week on a smear campaign against #MikeBrown instead of investigating or being at all helpful.	2
So a large Negro robbed a store and then the cops saw a large Negro.  WHAT WERE THEY SUPPOSED TO DO?!?!  Perhaps not execute him. #Ferguson	2
I'm not retweeting the pic of #MikeBrown's body, but evidently he lost the hat and changed his shoes and shorts. And lost ~40 lbs. #Ferguson	2
Photos of alleged robbery involving Michael Brown in #Ferguson (via police) http://t.co/gr83XTGO1t http://t.co/7V34OtGYcn	2
Look at his arrive time on the report. This man was still in the store. Exlplain this. #Ferguson #FergusonShooting http://t.co/caOWNddXxa	2
The other day I asked a manager at the #Ferguson Market if police had requested surveillance video. She said no.	2
Cigarettes on Staten Island. Cigars in #Ferguson. Are these seriously enough to take a life?	2
"Witness to #Ferguson shooting atty confirms Brown took cigars from store.  Client told FBI he ""did take cigarillos"" http://t.co/j9BARBU0c7"	2
So in #Ferguson, robbing a convenience carries the death penalty. Got it.	2
Arrived in Crestwood where officer Darren Wilson lives. When I knocked police officer rolled up and told me Wilson left days ago #Ferguson	2
It took the police 5 days to concoct this tale and this is what they came up with? #ninjaplease #ferguson	2

"Possible ""robbery"" took place and BAM! Like magic it's as if another UNARMED black youth being murdered has been forgotten #smh #Ferguson"	2
Even if #MikeBrown was running down the street with a bag full of boosted goods, he deserved a trial. Not a street execution. #Ferguson	2

"Every incident report I've seen says ""the suspect was X,"" ""the suspect did Y."" On the #Ferguson report, #MikeBrown is ALREADY NAMED. HOW??"	2
Do you understand what I'm saying? How had they already determined #MikeBrown was the suspect when the #Ferguson report was written?	2

Chief Jackson: initial contact between officer and #MikeBrown was not related to robbery. #Ferguson	2
#Ferguson police chief just confirmed that officer's interaction with Michael Brown NOT related to the robbery.	2
#Ferguson Police Chief: The initial contact between #DarrenWilson and #MikeBrown was NOT related to the alleged theft of cigars.	2
Why release the report about the robbery if it's not related to the contact with the cop who shot him? This all stinks. #Ferguson	2
"WOW RT @themarkberman: ""The initial contact between the officer and Mr. Brown was not related to the robbery,"" #Ferguson police chief says"	2
"""I know his initial contact was not related to the robbery,"" #Ferguson chief says. ""It was related to blocking the road."""	2
BOMBSHELL: #Ferguson chief says the police officer might not have even known about the robbery when he shot and killed Michael Brown.	2
Chief Jackson: officer was not aware that #MikeBrown was a robbery suspect. #Ferguson	2
Chief seems to make it very clear that shooter did NOT write an incident report. 5th Amendment. #Ferguson	2
#Ferguson Police Chief confirms when officer stopped #MikeBrown, he was not aware he was a suspect in a robbery.	2
"Q: Why did he stop Michael Brown? ""Because he was walking down the middle of the street,"" #Ferguson chief says."	1
The #Ferguson police chief confirmed the stop of #MikeBrown had absolutely nothing to do with the alleged convenience store robbery.	2
The officer who shot #MikeBrown did NOT know he was a suspect in a robbery, according to #Ferguson police chief. They were not related.	2
This #Ferguson PD chief press conference is AMAZING... he just ADMITTED Darren Wilson stopped him bc of the jaywalking.	1
Police chief said officer who shot Brown didn't know about any robbery #ferguson	2
Exactly. Why release the video if stopping Mike Brown was not related to the robbery? JESUS CHRIST THIS IS BAD. #Ferguson	2
"Q: ""why did he stop Michael Brown?""   #Ferguson Police Chief: ""because they were walking down the middle of the street blocking traffic"""	1
Lawyers for police in bad shootings often advise shooters not to write reports or even speak to commanders or investigators. #Ferguson	2
#Ferguson police chief says he released the robbery video because he was getting FOIA requests for it. How did anyone know to request it?	2
"Asked why he released surveillance video of robbery, Chief Jackson responds, ""because the press asked for it."" #MikeBrown #Ferguson"	2
Chief Jackson: officer Darren Wilson stopped #MikeBrown initially because he was in the street and blocking traffic. #Ferguson	1
the media didn't even know the video existed, but he just said they requested it? DUDE. #Ferguson	2
Wow! What was the point of bring out the robbery footage today if it had nothing to do with Michael Brown being stopped? #Ferguson	2
so ... they clearly released that video  only to shame &amp; blame the victim. #Ferguson #MikeBrown	2
So since we now know the officer knew nothing abt a robbery, we must ask why those tapes were released? #Ferguson. But we know why.	2
Key point: Officer Wilson was not aware that #MikeBrown was a robbery suspect. It will be key in establishing his state of mind. #Ferguson	2
"shorter #ferguson pd: ""damn, we thought we could dirty up this guys name, we didn't think you guys would CHECK"""	2
Ferguson PD now admits that Darren Wilson didn't know anything about the store robbery when he stopped Mike Brown! This is bad! #Ferguson	2
Cop who shot Brown did not know he was a robbery suspect, #Ferguson police chief says http://t.co/9pWsMI9HOj http://t.co/urxcAQk7Uy	2
The #Ferguson police chief just basically confirmed #MikeBrown was gunned to death for the crime of walking in the street?  Horrific.	2
What's so frustrating is that now we are talking about a robbery and not the killing of an unarmed kid. #ferguson	2
They released that information this morning about the robbery KNOWING #MikeBrown wasn't stopped for it? Explain why. EXPLAIN. WHY. #Ferguson	2
So, to sum up: 1) Darren Wilson KNEW NOTHING of the robbery, 2) shot #MikeBrown over jaywalking, and 3) was allowed to escape #Ferguson.	2
#Ferguson chief said the officer was unaware of any robbery &amp; stopped #MikeBrown for jay walking. #TheJig http://t.co/uLWzIJH5WJ	1
Are we supposed to be cool &amp; remain calm when the police after MURDERING a teenager SLANDER him to hide the killing behind racism? #Ferguson	2
#Ferguson police chief says officer Darren Wilson didn't know #MikeBrown was a robbery suspect http://t.co/SbpxzwwZWs	2
They desecrated #mikebrown's body then they desecrated his memory and plight for justice.   EXPLAIN THIS.   #Ferguson #DONTSHOOT	2
I'm so disgusted. #Ferguson RT @ZandarVTS: This has now devolved into the worst police shooting cover-up attempt in US history.	2
Report: #Ferguson cop identified as unarmed teen's killer skipped town days ago http://t.co/5GQvgcw3LJ	2
VIDEO Police release surveillance tape from #Ferguson store related to #MichaelBrown: http://t.co/hEIdfPTX60 http://t.co/CIM7L6TJND	2
Increasingly seems like #Ferguson police dept. spent all week playing dress-up, couldn't even be bothered to get its story straight	2
In what world do you let a cop who killed someone leave town? http://t.co/T0A3rn2PeL #Ferguson	2
#Ferguson Police Chief says #MikeBrown was stopped because he was walking in road NOT because he was suspected of stealing cigars.	1
Oh, whoops, the robbery had nothing to do with #MikeBrown being stopped, but at least now half of America thinks it did. - #Ferguson PD	2
.@CNN KEEPS playing the video while saying it has nothing to do with the murder of #MikeBrown this is PSYCHOLOGICAL WARFAE. #FERGUSON	2
If anyone's looking for a reason to murder me execution-style in the street, I stole a coke from a Walmart when I was 19. #Ferguson	2
UPDATE - Shooter #DarrenWilson didn't know #MikeBrown was a robbery suspect: #Ferguson http://t.co/p05krSfaXL http://t.co/R8CJVoTvex	2
This is what #Ferguson PD did to #HenryDavis in 2009 when they mistook him for a man with an outstanding warrant http://t.co/ZdHpyHfrCh	2
Since FBI is investigating the shooting, isn't Darren Wilson a fugitive &amp; the cops who let him leave accessories after the fact? #Ferguson	2
to be clear: an unarmed teenager POSSIBLY stealing a box of cigars does not warrant being shot to death by the police. #Ferguson	2
People got even angrier after the admission that the #Ferguson store theft had nothing to do with why Brown was stopped by Wilson.	2
"#Ferguson PD charged #HenryDavis w/ ""destruction of property"" for bleeding on their uniforms: http://t.co/qQWPClW3tG http://t.co/5U3nMoMiF2"	2
"Oh. So NOW the #Ferguson police chief says the cop didn't know about the robbery when he stopped #MikeBrown. The kid was ""jaywalking""? BS!"	1
Anybody else thinks the #Ferguson police chief is just making this up as he goes along? This is beyond embarrassing. It's shameful!	2

#Ferguson police: Officer involved in fatal shooting of Michael Brown didn't know he was suspect in alleged robbery. http://t.co/L6bieyrz2a	2
Officer in shooting death of MIchael Brown was unaware he was a suspect: #Ferguson police http://t.co/ZdxP58Ptqt http://t.co/ypfN4DmMZi	2
Report: #Ferguson police beat up wrong suspect then charged him for getting blood on uniforms in 2009 http://t.co/Mck8FYYOpp	2
#ferguson police engaged in character assassination to cover up actual assassination. you. simply. don't. shoot. unarmed. teenagers. EVER.	2
now shameful #ferguson police say Brown wasn't even a robbery suspect when he was shot. he was just an unarmed kid walking down the street.	2
WOKE. #Ferguson #mikebrown RT @ChamNature: 10 mins RT @DragonflyJonez: 6'4 290. In sandals. RT @_TheSpeakEasy: Hmm http://t.co/urAzIWRNI6	2

#ThatAwkwardMoment when the #Ferguson police chief admits that #MikeBrown was stopped for walking in the road.  #p2 http://t.co/6giGtKQgaB	1
"Everybody was orgasming about a white cop killing an ""innocent"" black kid. Reality kicked them in the nuts. #Ferguson http://t.co/hUx29W6P10"	2
#Ferguson chief let most of day go by b4 disclosing (after repeated Qs) that cop who killed #MikeBrown knew nothing about robbery. DANGER	2
Store owner told @FOX2now Monday that there was a theft, but said it was not MichaelBrown; said it was someone else #Ferguson	2
FACT. We know more about how #MikeBrown allegedly stole cheap cigars than how and why a #Ferguson police officer shot and killed him.	2
The press conf makes #Ferguson PD look like they've gone from stonewalling to counter punching. We give up a name, we drag his thru the mud.	2

Is the Police Chief in #Ferguson changing the story?  https://t.co/8ujqp0lpb5	2
MSNBC is literally reporting that Police Chief CLEARLY said it was about jay walking.   This is a fucking clown show. #Ferguson	1
Police in #Ferguson once charged a man for bleeding on their uniforms after 4 of them beat him http://t.co/op11jbVEUq http://t.co/crECAGF4t0	2
Remarkably, despite the military-style police presence in #Ferguson, a known killer was able to skip town http://t.co/lDGjp6Wt1j	2
Americans are 8 times more likely to be killed by a police officer than by a terrorist. #Ferguson	2
Shot ten times. Unarmed. What else is there to talk about? #StopTheSmear #Ferguson	0
I refuse to call the #Ferguson police chief incompetent when it is so clear the release of that video was calculated and brazen. #MikeBrown	2
