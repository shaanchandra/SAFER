Malia Obama may have done irreparable harm to her career this morning when she decided to join a gang of thugs in Chicago for a day of drinking, drugs and dogfighting at a public park in Chicago. Malia was arrested along with seven others and charged with wanton endangerment of animals, public intoxication and possession of a controlled substance.  She was found in the company of mostly older men when police arrived after being called by a concerned citizen complaining about a loud group of people watching dogs fight in the park. According to a witness:  “They was all just right out there in the open drinkin’ and lettin’ their dogs go at it. I saw some smoking weed. Some were doing other things I don’t know. All those dudes had that baggy pants thing. They weren’t the types of people you’d expect that girl to be with.”  According to the Secret Service, Malia had slipped away late last night after being told open air parties at public parks were too dangerous. She wasn’t seen again until she showed up in the 12th precinct jail. Her parents have not been available for comment.  Public records show she was released on her own recognizance and given a court date of later this month for arraignment.	0
Representative Bob Goodlatte will miss out on the fun of issuing a subpoena. Photo: Pete Marovich/Bloomberg via Getty Images  Peter Strzok, the FBI agent who sent anti-Trump messages to a colleague while leading the investigation of Hillary Clinton’s emails and Russia’s involvement in the Trump campaign, has said he’s willing to testify before the House Judiciary Committee, or any other committee that wants to talk with him. This could lead to dramatic hearings, as Strzok could expose more information about those probes, and is central to President Trump’s effort to discredit Special Counsel Robert Mueller’s investigation.  Reports last week indicated that House Judiciary chairman Bob Goodlatte was preparing to subpoena Strzok as part of the House investigation into the FBI’s conduct during the 2016 election. Strzok’s lawyer, Aitan Goelman, said in a letter to Goodlatte released Sunday that the move would be unnecessary, as Strzok “intends to voluntarily appear and testify before your committee and any other Congressional committee that invites him.”  The letter noted that Strzok cooperated fully with the DOJ inspector general, who issued a report last week that was highly critical of the agent. In the lead-up to the 2016 election Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were having an affair, exchanged anti-Trump messages on their FBI-issued phones. In one, Page asked if Trump might become president and Strzok replied, “No. No he won’t. We’ll stop it.” The inspector general found no evidence connecting their views with “specific investigative decisions,” but said that comment and others “implies a willingness to take official action.”  Strzok and Page said he meant Trump wouldn’t be elected, and noted that they did not do anything to hurt Trump’s odds, like leaking the existence of the Russia probe before the election. Goelman told the Washington Post on Sunday that there’s “no question” that Strzok regrets sending the messages, but that “I think what he was doing is expressing his political opinions in what he thought was a private text conversation, and he regrets that this has been weaponized by people with political motivations to try to discredit the Mueller investigation.”  Mueller removed Strzok from his investigation several weeks after it started following the discovery of the texts.  Goelman said that if asked to testify, Strzok would be willing to testify without immunity, and would not invoke his Fifth Amendment rights. He said the agent “intends to answer any question put to him, and he intends to defend the integrity of the Clinton email investigation, the Russia collusion investigation to the extent that that’s a topic, and his own integrity.”  Trump reiterated his thoughts on the matter on Sunday night, which are not supported by the inspector general’s findings. The report did not cover the Russia probe, though that did not stop Trump’s allies from calling for Mueller’s immediate suspension.  Why was the FBI’s sick loser, Peter Strzok, working on the totally discredited Mueller team of 13 Angry & Conflicted Democrats, when Strzok was giving Crooked Hillary a free pass yet telling his lover, lawyer Lisa Page, that “we’ll stop” Trump from becoming President? Witch Hunt! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018  “The highest level of bias I’ve ever witnessed in any law enforcement officer.” Trey Gowdy on the FBI’s own, Peter Strzok. Also remember that they all worked for Slippery James Comey and that Comey is best friends with Robert Mueller. A really sick deal, isn’t it? — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 18, 2018  Strzok still works for the FBI, but it’s unclear what he does now. The inspector general referred him, Page, and three other people to the FBI office that handles disciplinary action.	0
Liberal menace and purveyor of lies, Nancy Pelosi (D-California), was just taken from her office in handcuffs by the United States Secret Service. While little information is available as of yet, one agent did tell a reporter for the Washington Examiner that the arrest came at the direct order of the president:  “Mrs. Pelosi’s arrest order comes directly from the Oval Office,” said Special Agent Matthew Derpmore, “She’s wanted for questioning in a possible coup attempt against the president. That’s all we’re authorized to say at this time.”  The White House OIP has confirmed that report, calling Pelosi a usurper and a threat to the office of President Trump:  Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi’s arrest for conspiacy to overthrow the office of the President is being taken very seriously. She is said to be at the head of a select group of congressmen who have set in motion plans to use the president’s allegedly unlawful actions to begin imeachment hearings. Without evidence and with a clear denial from the president of these allegations such actions warrant charges of conspiracy and possibly even treason.  Pelosi’s office hasn’t issued a statement yet. According to records obtained by Breitbart, three other congressmen are also wanted and are currently having warrants against them served. We’ll keep you updated as the story progresses.	0
Joint DHS and ODNI Election Security Statement  Friday, October 07, 2016  DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE  WASHINGTON, DC 20511    October 07, 2016    Joint Statement from the Department of Homeland Security  and Office of the Director of National Intelligence  on Election Security  The U.S. Intelligence Community (USIC) is confident that the Russian Government directed the recent compromises of e-mails from US persons and institutions, including from US political organizations. The recent disclosures of alleged hacked e-mails on sites like DCLeaks.com and WikiLeaks and by the Guccifer 2.0 online persona are consistent with the methods and motivations of Russian-directed efforts. These thefts and disclosures are intended to interfere with the US election process. Such activity is not new to Moscow—the Russians have used similar tactics and techniques across Europe and Eurasia, for example, to influence public opinion there. We believe, based on the scope and sensitivity of these efforts, that only Russia's senior-most officials could have authorized these activities.Some states have also recently seen scanning and probing of their election-related systems, which in most cases originated from servers operated by a Russian company. However, we are not now in a position to attribute this activity to the Russian Government. The USIC and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) assess that it would be extremely difficult for someone, including a nation-state actor, to alter actual ballot counts or election results by cyber attack or intrusion. This assessment is based on the decentralized nature of our election system in this country and the number of protections state and local election officials have in place. States ensure that voting machines are not connected to the Internet, and there are numerous checks and balances as well as extensive oversight at multiple levels built into our election process.Nevertheless, DHS continues to urge state and local election officials to be vigilant and seek cybersecurity assistance from DHS. A number of states have already done so. DHS is providing several services to state and local election officials to assist in their cybersecurity. These services include cyber “hygiene” scans of Internet-facing systems, risk and vulnerability assessments, information sharing about cyber incidents, and best practices for securing voter registration databases and addressing potential cyber threats. DHS has convened an Election Infrastructure Cybersecurity Working Group with experts across all levels of government to raise awareness of cybersecurity risks potentially affecting election infrastructure and the elections process. Secretary Johnson and DHS officials are working directly with the National Association of Secretaries of State to offer assistance, share information, and provide additional resources to state and local officials.	1
"Aury Terriquez, left, 6, whose parents are from Guatemala, and Lucia Jimenez, 5, whose parents are from Bolivia, joined immigration advocates to call on the Obama administration to mitigate the child migrant crisis. (Tom Williams/CQ Roll Call)  The House GOP task force charged with making recommendations to colleagues on the influx of unaccompanied, undocumented immigrant children at the U.S.-Mexico border might suggest controversial changes to a 2008 trafficking law — and at least one Democrat wants to go that route as well.  Rep. Henry Cuellar of Texas, a fiscally conservative Blue Dog Democrat who made headlines on Wednesday for blasting President Barack Obama's failure to visit the border during a fundraising trip to the area, said he would soon introduce legislation to allow all children apprehended at the southwest border to qualify for ""voluntary return"" to their home countries.  A law known as the ""William Wilberforce Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act"" gave that right only to children from counties ""contiguous"" to the United States, namely Mexico and Canada. Given the droves of unaccompanied minors trying to enter the country illegally from Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador — among other parts of Central America — Cuellar said tweaking the 2008 act would ease conditions at the border, with fewer children having to wait long periods for deportation hearings at overcrowded detention centers if they would just as soon return to their homes on their own terms. ""All the protections under the law would be kept in, asylum, credible fear, victim of a sex crime,"" Cuellar told a group of reporters. ""The only thing we change is that aspect of it, that allows them to [be deported] on a voluntary basis.""  Members of the Republican task force also said in a statement late Wednesday that revisiting the act is one of their recommendations to remedy the border crisis.  ""We agree with the President that [children] must be returned to their home countries in the most humane way possible,"" they wrote, ""and that will require a revision of the 2008 Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act.""  Cuellar said that he had not yet begun to make the rounds to colleagues to garner co-sponsors for his bill, but that a certain senator from Texas with ""a little bit of experience"" — a nod to senior Texas Sen. John Cornyn, a Republican — would be moving forward with companion legislation on his side of the Capitol.  Obama has also said there should be some re-evaluation of the law, enacted in the waning days of the George W. Bush administration to protect children against sex trafficking.  But most Democrats are likely to bristle at the prospect of touching the law, fearful that any tinkering would leave young people vulnerable.  ""I think there's ample evidence that children who are potential victims are being returned without adequate inquiry,"" said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif. ""I think [Cuellar] has very few people in the Democratic caucus who would agree with him.""  Rep. Raúl M. Grijalva, D-Ariz., said that he and 10 other members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus immigration task force met earlier on Wednesday — and dispersed with the resolve to be oppose any revisions to the trafficking law.  He said he had ""suspected all along"" that Cuellar might be cooking something up on his own. But the CHC task force meeting focused on the issue in the context of what changes Republicans might want to pursue, either in standalone legislation or more likely as a policy rider in Obama's pending request for Congress to appropriate $3.8 billion to bolster resources at the southwest border.  ""We need to take a position that protects children,"" Grijalva said, ""and a Republican effort ... to undo the 2008 law, that would be something we would fight.""

A transcript of an Oval Office interview Friday with President Donald Trump by AP White House Correspondent Julie Pace. Where the audio recording of the interview is unclear, ellipses or a notation that the recording was unintelligible are used.  AP: I do want to talk to you about the 100 days.  TRUMP: Good.  AP: I want to ask a few questions on some topics that are happening toward the end of the interview.  TRUMP: Did you see Aya (Hijazi, an Egyptian-American charity worker who had been detained in the country for nearly three years) ...  AP: Can you tell me a little bit about how that came about?  TRUMP: No, just — you know, I asked the government to let her out. ...  TRUMP: You know Obama worked on it for three years, got zippo, zero.  AP: How did you hear about this story?  TRUMP: Many people, human rights people, are talking about it. It’s an incredible thing, especially when you meet her. You realize — I mean, she was in a rough place.  AP: Did you have to strike a deal with (Egyptian President Abdel-Fattah) el-Sissi over this?  TRUMP: No. No deal. He was here. He — I said, “I really would appreciate it if you would look into this and let her out.” And as you know, she went through a trial. And anyway, she was let go. And not only she, it was a total of eight people. ...  ___  TRUMP: Yeah, it’s funny: One of the best chemistries I had was with (German Chancellor Angela) Merkel.  (Crosstalk) AP: Really?  TRUMP: Chancellor Merkel.  TRUMP: And I guess somebody shouted out, “Shake her hand, shake her hand,” you know. But I never heard it. But I had already shaken her hand four times. You know, because we were together for a long time.  AP: Did you expect you would have good chemistry with her?  TRUMP: No. Because, um, I’m at odds on, you know, the NATO payments and I’m at odds on immigration. We had unbelievable chemistry. And people have given me credit for having great chemistry with all of the leaders, including el-Sissi. ...  TRUMP: So it was a great thing to see that happen.  ___  AP: Do you feel like you have changed the office of the presidency, how the presidency can be used to effect change?  TRUMP: I think the 100 days is, you know, it’s an artificial barrier. It’s not very meaningful. I think I’ve established amazing relationships that will be used the four or eight years, whatever period of time I’m here. I think for that I would be getting very high marks because I’ve established great relationships with countries, as President el-Sissi has shown and others have shown. Well, if you look at the president of China, people said they’ve never seen anything like what’s going on right now. I really liked him a lot. I think he liked me. We have a great chemistry together. ...  TRUMP: I’ve developed great relationships with all of these leaders. Nobody’s written that. In fact, they said, “Oh, well, he’s not treating them nicely,” because on NATO, I want them to pay up. But I still get along with them great, and they will pay up. In fact, with the Italian prime minister yesterday, you saw, we were joking, “Come on, you have to pay up, you have to pay up.” He’ll pay.  AP: Did he say that? In your meeting? Your private meeting?  TRUMP: He’s going to end up paying. But you know, nobody ever asked the question. Nobody asked. Nobody ever asked him to pay up. So it’s a different kind of a presidency.  AP: Do you feel like that’s one thing that you’ve changed, that you maybe are actually asking the direct questions about some of these things?  TRUMP: Yeah. Let me give me an example. A little before I took office there was a terrible article about the F-35 fighter jet. It was hundreds of billions of dollars over budget. It was seven years behind schedule. It was a disaster. So I called in Lockheed and I said, “I’m sorry, we’re going to have to bid this out to another company, namely Boeing,” or whoever else. But Boeing. And I called in Boeing and I started getting competing offers back and forth. ...  TRUMP: I saved $725 millio	1
Pope Francis urged political leaders on Monday to defend migrants, saying their safety should take precedence over national security concerns and that they should not be subjected to collective deportations.  His challenge to politicians, made in a comprehensive position paper on migrants and refugees, again appeared to put him at odds with the restrictive policies of a number of governments dealing with growing popular anti-immigrant sentiment.  “Solidarity must be concretely expressed at every stage of the migratory experience – from departure through journey to arrival and return,” he said in a message ahead of the Roman Catholic Church’s World Day of Migrants and Refugees.  Calling for “broader options for migrants and refugees to enter destination countries safely and legally,” he said the human rights and dignity of all migrants had to be respected regardless of their legal status.  “The principle of the centrality of the human person … obliges us to always prioritize personal safety over national security,” he said.  This appeared to be a reference to fears voiced in many European countries that refugees inflows could lead to security problems in their host countries. He said it was necessary “to ensure that agents in charge of border control are properly trained.”  He called for “alternative solutions to detention” for illegal immigrants and said “collective and arbitrary expulsions of migrants and refugees are not suitable solutions”.  Francis said migrants should be seen as “a true resource for the communities that welcome them” and be given freedom of movement, access to means of communication, access to justice and everyday rights such as opening a bank account.  Francis, an Argentine who has made defense of migrants a major plank of his papacy, has criticized anti-immigrant stands by national leaders including U.S. President Donald Trump. Last year, Francis condemned then-candidate Trump’s intention to build a wall on the border with Mexico.  Migrant children deserved particular protection, the pope said. They “must be spared any form of detention related to migratory status,” guaranteed access to primary and secondary education and have the right to remain when they come of age.  Francis’s message immediately drew the ire of the right-wing Northern League party in Italy because it implicitly supported a controversial law proposal that would grant citizenship to children who are born in Italy of immigrant parents.  “The universal right to a nationality should be recognized and duly certified for all children at birth,” the pope said.	0

An Israeli airplane in Syria has dropped the first nuclear bomb deployed in armed conflict since the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945, according to local reports.  The nuclear blast targeted an ammunitions depot in Hama, Syria and was so powerful it caused a 2.6 magnitude earthquake recorded close to Taqsees, Hama, Syria at 10:40 pm local time Sunday, at the same time Syrian TV reported several explosions in the same area.  Moments later, videos of a massive set of explosions, reportedly at a Syrian military base at Jabal al-Bukhut 47, some 10 miles south-east of Hama, began to appear on social media.	0

Clint Eastwood says his doctors have put him on notice to get his affairs in order and prepare for that final trip in one of those limousine station wagons we call a hearse. The famous actor, 89, says he’ll be lucky to see 2019:  “I’ve had a good run. They say I’m probably gonna be on the list of dead people at the awards show next year. Me and that damned empty chair. Guaranteed. Why can’t folks just let that go?”  Eastwood, always in good spirits, says that he’s made a good life for his family and taken care of them with trust funds, homes and large insurance policies and that he’d like to see his personal estate go to something…bigger:  “I have been able to sit here in this magnificent ranch watching as President Trump made America great again in just a few months. He’ll persevere through the witch hunt and I will do what I can to make his journey easier.”  Eastwood is donating his Northern California ranch, 40K acres of grazing land in Nevada and more than $7 million in cash and other assets to Trump’s 2020 campaign. The campaign has said they will be delighted to accept the donation and will use the ranch as a command center for the entire Pacific Northwest:  “We’ll be able to sit up there, far from the prying eyes of Obama and the deep state and the deep levels of corruption still inside the Justice department and FBI, and strategize without worrying about being called before a federal prosecutor for it.”  Clint Eastwood will be remembered for a lot of things after he’s gone, but this may be the biggest. Thanks for a lifetime of entertaining us, Clint!	0
"AMANPOUR: Madam Speaker, thank you so much for joining me.  PELOSI: My pleasure.  AMANPOUR: Can I ask you about some of the important news that's been made this week, particularly in -- in the House and that would be on Afghanistan.  Last year, 32 Democrats voted against the funding of the war in Afghanistan. This year, 102 Democrats voted against. That seems to be a dramatic rejection from the president's own party of his major strategic goal.  PELOSI: Well, not quite. You have to put the votes in perspective.  Our president came in. He was president maybe two months, three months, by the time we took the vote last year. And the Republicans said they weren't going to vote for the funding. And so it took all Democratic votes.  I persuaded my members to give this president a chance, to give him room in order to have time to implement his plan. And in -- and in the course of time -- now the Republicans said they would vote for it, it gave my members the freedom to express themselves on the war in Afghanistan.  AMANPOUR: Now, you didn't vote.  PELOSI: No.  AMANPOUR: I know the speaker doesn't have to vote.  PELOSI: Right.  AMANPOUR: But how would you have voted?  PELOSI: Well, we brought the bill to the floor. And that was a statement that said that we knew that our troops needed to have what was -- what they needed to have would be provided for them. So we will never abandon our men and women in uniform. On the other hand, it gave our members a chance to express their view.  AMANPOUR: How long do you think you can keep your skeptical members, as you call them, on side?  PELOSI: Well, again, we have a -- varying degrees of expression here. We are there, we've taken an oath to defend the constitution and therefore the American people. And that's what people will be looking at -- how does this figure into our protecting the American people?  Is it worth it?  AMANPOUR: Well, is it worth it?  PELOSI: Yes.  AMANPOUR: Is it worth it?  PELOSI: That's the question.  AMANPOUR: But that's my question to you.  PELOSI: Well, we will -- as I said, we will see the metrics as they unfold in the next few months and certainly by the end of this year.  AMANPOUR: But what does your gut tell you?  PELOSI: in my visits to afghanistan, the last time i was there was over mother's day weekend to visit the troops///and the four metrics that we have always used year in and year out on these visits have been about security. And the military tells us this cannot be won militarily solely.  Secondly, governance and ending corruption.....  AMANPOUR: I'm just trying to figure out, for instance, you know, what you think is the right thing to do in Afghanistan at the moment. Look, ""Time"" magazine, this week, has this as its cover -- a girl whose had her nose and ears cut off by the Taliban.  You know, to put it right down to its basics, is America going to abandon the women of Afghanistan, the people of Afghanistan again?  PELOSI: Well, first of all, we're in Afghanistan because it's in our strategic national interests to be so for our own national security, to stop terrorism, to increase global security. The women of Afghanistan have been a priority for many of the women in Congress -- and men, too, but the women have taken a special interest.  When I was there in -- around Mother's Day, I went to a province in Southern Afghanistan and visited with women.  And we talked about the education of their children, the health of women and the rest. And they -- especially their daughters.- they said we want that, but that can't happen without security. And these women in this remote province told us and that can't happen without the end of corruption.  So what we would like to see is for President Karzai be a more reliable, a stronger partner, ending the corruption, increasing -- improving the governance  AMANPOUR: Vice President Biden, talking about the dead line for the transition, which is summer of 2011, he said on this program a week or two ago that there's going t"	1
Insiders in Senate Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi’s office tell the Army Times that there might be an open spot “as early as next week” following the bombshell allegations leveled at Pelosi this past week.  While the mainstream media continues to ignore Pelosi’s scandals, Breitbart reported on Thursday that “at least five men and one woman have complained about Pelosi making unwanted advances in the past, but it always got swept under the rug.”  According to the publication, two sources have confirmed that they were “incentivized” to transfer out of her office — one with a promotion and one with a lump sum cash payment of $15,000.  According to insiders, Pelosi “has determined that she has no choice but to step down, though she wholeheartedly denies the allegations.”  Three of Pelosi’s accusers, all male, are former interns and pages, while the others worked as a clerical aide and a member of the cleaning staff..  Pelosi has been attacking Roy Moore lately for his alleged consensual affair with a young woman, but was simply her covering up her own misdeeds with fake outrage.  It’s time for that old bat to retire anyway, but it’s good to see her go sooner rather than later. Now it’s time for a Republican to take her seat.	0
The city of Houston has already seen enough tragedy due to the catastrophic flooding from Hurricane Harvey, and unfortunately things took a turn for the worst today when a U.S. Navy ship collided with a building in the downtown area.  The ship was eventually identified as an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer belonging to the Navy’s 7th fleet.  It is unclear why this ship was over 20 miles inland and trying to navigate through a major metropolitan area or was not able to see the building and take evasive action.  “I had climbed up on my roof due to dem risin’ flood waters, when I saw a big ship sailin’ down the street. I says to myself ‘Oh Lawdy, someone’s done come to rescue us!’ and then it sails right past my house and smack straight into that yonder building,” said Georgia Brown, a resident who witnessed the incident.  Following incidents involving the USS Fitzgerald, USS John S. McCain, and the USS Ted Kennedy, this marks the fifth collision incident this summer for destroyers from the Navy’s besieged 7th fleet.  Even though the Navy declined to comment on the cause of the collision due to an ongoing investigation, it did say that the captain had been relieved of his command.  A senior defense official theorized that the ship had likely veered off course from its patrol route in the South China Sea, despite reserve from the Navy.  Navy officials have stated that they are planning a number of PowerPoint trainings related to urban maritime navigation.	0
London (CNN) Britain's Queen Elizabeth II has lost the last descendant of her original corgi after 14-year-old Willow was put down at Windsor Castle on Sunday following a battle with cancer, according to UK media reports.  Willow was the last in a long line of royal corgis owned by Britain's longest-serving monarch, reported British newspaper the Daily Mail.  Buckingham Palace declined to comment on the dog's death, telling CNN it was a private matter.  The Queen's fondness for corgis is well known, with Willow and the monarch even appearing beside James Bond actor Daniel Craig for a sketch shown during the 2012 London Olympic opening ceremony.  Queen Elizabeth II has reportedly owned more than 30 corgis during her reign.  While the Queen still reportedly owns several other dogs, Willow was the only remaining descendant of Susan, the original corgi given to then-Princess Elizabeth on her 18th birthday in 1944.

It’s not a good day for Democrats.  Democrat House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi suffered what her staff is calling a “breakdown” this morning and was transferred via ambulance to Bethesda. Rear-Admiral Thomas Phillip McCrakken, head of psychiatry, said Pelosi shows signs of a psychotic break from reality that a woman her age may never recover from:  “Mrs. Pelosi is in an advanced stage of disengagement from reality. She’s under the impression that Democrats still have say in how our country is governed, for example, which is, quite frankly, just silly. She also believes, as she told me personally just yesterday, that Barack Obama is coming back to lead us into midterms where he will win the White House and she will be Speaker again.”  Well that’s just sad. While Obama will probably hit the campaign trail pretty hard for the Democrats in 2018, there won’t be any winning for them. They’ll continue to lose until they figure out how to shut down the will of the people the likes of whom frequent websites like ours.  Real Patriots who love their president. No. Matter. What.	0
Donald Trump took a major step toward securing the Republican presidential nomination following the mogul’s Super Tuesday victory, and faced with the prospect of a President Trump, Miley Cyrus turned to Instagram Tuesday to tell her 38.1 million followers, “Donald Trump is a fucking nightmare!”  Cyrus wrote the caption next to a publicity photo of Trump; Cyrus’ Instagram burn has gained 239,000 likes since it was posted Tuesday. On Wednesday, the Dead Petz singer continued lobbying against the GOP frontrunner with a photo of Trump’s delegate totals over Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and a caption where Cyrus playfully threatened to move out of the country if Trump is elected and a hashtag #aintapartyindausaanymo.

Cyrus isn’t the only artist to lament a possible future with Trump as commander in chief: Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Flea recently told Rolling Stone, “I can’t take Donald Trump or anything he says seriously. I just think that he’s a silly reality-show bozo and blustering guy who likes getting attention. I don’t think he wants to be president, and I don’t think he has a chance to be the president. He’s just some egotistical, silly person whose main concern in life is getting a blowjob. He wants to be on TV and he wants everyone to thinks he’s important.”	0

It’s been a rough day for Trump’s extended family as White House adviser Jared Kushner‘s has officially had his security clearance downgraded from Top Secret to the Secret level, a major sign of disrespect to the young adviser.  Kushner, who is President Trump’s son-in-law, will no longer be able to access top-secret intelligence, Politico confirmed, noting three sources close to the situation.  Sources explained to the publication that a memo was released last week to Kushner and other White House aides informing them that their security clearances would be downgraded from the Top Secret/SCI level to the Secret level.  According to Politico, the memo he was sent was not personally signed by chief of staff John Kelly.  White House chief of staff John Kelly is reportedly furious with first daughter Ivanka Trump‘s job performance within the administration, according to a recent report by CNN.  Sources revealed to the news network that Kelly thinks that Trump has failed to have an objective perspective on the first daughter and senior adviser to the president.  Kelly has reportedly explained to others privately that the first daughter is “playing government,” while branding her child tax credit as “a pet project.”  The shocking report comes after Trump’s trip to the closing Olympic ceremonies in Pyeongchang, South Korea last week, which has raised concerns among several in the White House, including Kelly.  “This isn’t like going to Italy. The stakes are far higher and more complex,” a source close to President Trump explained to CNN.  Kelly reportedly expressed his worries behind closed doors about the first daughter’s utter lack of experience, however, the White House assured this past Monday that he was in support of her visit.

The two officials were reportedly on their way to deliver a search warrant on the Clinton Presidential library, when they were tortured and killed.  The particulars of the crime were incomplete but the one thing that was for sure was that whoever managed to do it, was clearly a professional since they allegedly left absolutely no clue behind. Trey Gowdy had nothing to comment about this, for safety reasons. However he reportedly released a statement from his office in which he was held up by United States Marshals for protection. “The incident in Arkansas is just the latest in a vast conspiracy to cover up crimes by one of the most corrupt families in human history. No, we have no evidence. There’s never any evidence. What we do have, however, is a mole. Someone inside my own committee cost those men their lives by leaking their travel plans. I intend to find out who that mole is and have them waterboarded as an enemy of the state until they give up their boss.” CLICK THE VIDEO BELOW:  video	0
The only person allowed to cast a ballot that counts in the Democratic People’s Republic of Korea is dead of an apparent high-powered gunshot wound to the head. North Korean State Television says the bullet came from the sniper rifle of an American positioned more than a mile away.  The report comes shortly after North Korea successfully tested a long-range ICBM capable of reaching Alaska and possibly Hawaii. Trump promised swift and appropriate action. This seems to be it. Liberals will cry murder and say we don’t have the right just before they remind us of how many civilians died in Iraq when a president refused to use a single bullet to end Saddam Hussein and instead dragged us to war for a decade.  loading...  The Trump administration, State Department, Pentagon and any general or admiral available all deny the allegations, calling Kim a “despicable man” with “a world full of enemies.” President Trump hasn’t answered the allegations at all, simply telling a reporter from CNN that they’re better off “making up fake news rather than trying to understand how policy works.”  For now, the family that runs North Korea is trying to figure out the next step. Installing the next in the line without properly addressing the issue could end with no Kims left to hold power.	0
WASHINGTON – U.S. Representative Evan Jenkins (R-W.Va.) is continuing to push for passage of his legislation to ensure federal opioid epidemic funding goes to the states most affected, like West Virginia.  The federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Administration announced on Monday that West Virginia will be receiving $330,000 in additional funding, as our state has the highest overdose death rate in the nation.  This supplemental funding was needed because the formula for funding under the 21st Century Cures Act sent large amounts of funding to populous states, while states most impacted saw smaller amounts and had unmet needs.  “I appreciate and welcome this additional funding to help our state combat the drug crisis. Federal agencies must prioritize aid to the states struggling the most, and West Virginia must be at the very top of the list. President Trump unveiled his opioid response plan this week, and it is time for Congress to pass my legislation to make sure that West Virginia and other states hardest hit by the drug crisis get the resources they need to truly make an impact in combating this epidemic. We must to everything possible to help people in need find recovery and stop the flood of opioids and other drugs into our communities,” Rep. Jenkins said.  The 21st Century Cures Act, bipartisan legislation signed into law in 2016, included $1 billion in funding to address the drug crisis. In distributing these funds, the U.S. Health and Human Services Department and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration relied on a funding formula that benefited states with larger populations.  The Federal Opioid Response Fairness Act, introduced by Jenkins and Rep. Annie Kuster (D-N.H.), would make clear that per capita overdose deaths should be a part of the formula used to distribute 21st Century Cures Act funding. The introduction of this bill followed an announcement by the U.S. Health and Human Services Department and SAMHSA that there would be no change in the funding formula for the distribution of opioid State Targeted Response grants.	1

CNNews– A 10-year-old young boy who had eaten a banana his mom acquired at a Walmart in Tulsa, Oklahoma, was hurried to the emergency clinic due to fever, chills and tiredness simply seven days after usage. After a thorough examination, blood tests and scans the young boy tested favorable for the HIV virus. His mother certainly in shock. However, the 10-year-old child was not the only one admitted to the medical facility for the very same concern. Eight kids, all under the age of 17, have actually been identified as HIV-positive within the month of March. Exactly what is the something they share? Getting bananas from The Tulsa, Oklahoma Walmart.  In accordance with the moms and dads, they sent several foods their kids had been consuming to medical professionals for screening, along with documenting the different places they had visited within the month. They discovered that 8 children had consumed bananas from the superstore. The facility, LHC Laboratories, evaluated the bananas which all came up positive consisting of the HIV virus. Scientists are still attempting to understand how the infection might have gotten in the bananas, remained active, and contaminated the kids through consumption.  In the meantime, bananas are being managed the racks in Walmart stores across the United States. According to many media outlets, the CDC is motivating Americans to discard any leftover bananas and to call your doctor if you experience any of the following signs:  Fever  Chills  Rash  Night sweats  Muscle aches  Aching throat  Tiredness  Inflamed lymph nodes  Mouth sores  These signs might be an indication that you have actually contracted the HIV virus and have to look for medical attention immediately.	0

Senate Democrats Demand Supreme Court Nominee Not Be Unduly Influenced By U.S. Constitution  WASHINGTON, D.C.—Still reeling from Trump’s previous Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, Democrats plan to scrutinize any new nominee to ensure that he or she isn’t yet another crony of something called “The Constitution,” Senate Democrats announced Friday.  “Time and time again, we find progressive laws getting struck down,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a Senate address. “And it’s always — always — the ones the Constitution is against. These right-wing judges don’t think for themselves, they just do whatever the Constitution says. And it’s time for that to end.”  Senate Democrats have vowed to make sure that any new nominee isn’t going to be beholden to outside influences like the Constitution, the founding fathers, or the rule of law. “We need judges to be advocates of progressive laws,” Senator Elizabeth Warren added. “Not people who will bow to the whims of the Constitution, pitting its extremist values of freedom of speech and freedom of religion against our agenda.”  “We’re sick and tired of the Constitution sitting in the National Archives, manipulating everything we do,” stated Senator Cory Booker, trying to emote for the cameras but failing. Booker then called a ten-minute recess for him to refresh his supply of fake tears before he could continue.  Asked about their concerns, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he “doesn’t care” and plans to “completely ignore” the Democrats in the nomination process since “there’s nothing they can do” and he is “literally unstoppable.”	0
Lisa Page, former FBI lawyer under James Comey and Andrew McCabe, has become the latest rat to depart the sinking ship.  According to testimony given by Page during two days of closed-door House hearings, former bosses at the FBI instructed her to cover-up the fact that China, not Russia, hacked the DNC server.  Truepundit.com reports: The embattled Page tossed James Comey, Andrew McCabe, Peter Strzok and Bill Priestap among others under the Congressional bus, alleging the upper echelon of the FBI concealed intelligence confirming Chinese state-backed ‘assets’ had illegally acquired former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton’s 30,000+ “missing” emails, federal sources said.  The Russians didn’t do it. The Chinese did, according to well-placed FBI sources.  And while Democratic lawmakers and the mainstream media prop up Russia as America’s boogeyman, it was the ironically Chinese who acquired Hillary’s treasure trove of classified and top secret intelligence from her home-brewed private server.  And a public revelation of that magnitude — publicizing that a communist world power intercepted Hillary’s sensitive and top secret emails — would have derailed Hillary Clinton’s presidential hopes. Overnight. But it didn’t simply because it was concealed.  FBI bosses knew of the breach yet did nothing to investigate, seemingly trying to run out the clock on the alarming revelations to protect Hillary during her heated presidential campaign with Trump. So instead of investigating the hacking of Clinton’s server, FBI bosses sat quietly.  And did nothing to confirm the Chinese assets were linked to their government. Or assess the damage such a tremendous breach posed to national security. Did the Chinese government access Hillary’s emails? The FBI didn’t care enough to investigate at the risk of besmirching Clinton and further soiling her during the election.  Hundreds of top secret documents and even the president’s daily travel and security itineraries were on that server — and intercepted by a communist country — yet the FBI sat on the evidence. Likewise, all of Clinton’s and her inner circle’s outgoing emails were compromised as well, sources confirmed.  Even the Inspector General had tipped off the FBI — specifically Strzok — about the foreign breach. Still, no timely case was pursued.  That same cover-up pattern fits FBI bosses who time after time stalled and concealed other criminal intelligence on Clinton in the weeks prior to the election.  We could write more detail here and ramble on and on but at this point, we simply ask.  Is anyone going to go to prison for politicizing the FBI and covering up countless crimes committed by FBI personnel in a variety of coordinated schemes to protect Hillary and the Democrats?	0
The pro-life movement in the United States has long advocated their stance that human life begins at conception and that the human fetus is a person and therefore has a right to live. However, a new argument has taken flight over the last month that is taking the abortion debate to the next level. The variety in opinion on the issue of abortion is reflected in the diverse views of religious groups, but now pro-lifers are declaring “ejaculation is murder” and they want strict laws against the practice.  “Life begins BEFORE conception. This is why the Catholics do not believe in birth control,” said Rachel Stratt, pro-life activist. “God made men’s semen for a purpose, and you can just “waste” that purpose by gratifying yourself whenever you want to. Every time you do, you are literally killing thousands of babies! Ejaculation is murder and every sperm cell is a life!”  Stratt and her group of protesters are calling for a law that will make ejaculating for self gratification illegal in every state across the country. “Millions upon millions of innocent lives are wasted every day while men have lustful thoughts or watch those sick pornos on PornHub. We have got to put a stop to this as a human race. Save the sperm, save the children!” A petition on Change.org to stop the ‘needless wasting of sperm through self gratification’ has already received 85,000 signatures in less than three weeks. The petition needs 100,000 signatures before it is reviewed and responded by the White House. This week, 38 White House conservatives say they would pass the bill if given the opportunity to do so – all 38 of them are women.	0

"    Return to Transcripts main page  CNN LIVE EVENT/SPECIAL  Democratic Candidates Compassion Forum  Aired April 13, 2008 - 20:00 ET  THIS IS A RUSH TRANSCRIPT. THIS COPY MAY NOT BE IN ITS FINAL FORM AND MAY BE UPDATED.    BROWN: Good evening, everybody, to our viewers in the United States and around the world. Welcome to Messiah College in Grantham, Pennsylvania. I'm Campbell Brown.  Tonight, we bring you something different in this already extraordinary campaign year. We are calling it the Compassion Forum, an evening with the Democratic presidential candidates to focus on the issues of faith and compassion and how a president's faith can affect us all.    The focus tonight is to take the conversation beyond the candidate's standard policy points. And some of these questions tonight will be deeply personal.    We are here before a distinguished, bipartisan audience of faith leaders from around the country, from the head of the Southern Baptist Convention to the head of Catholic charities to rabbis and lay leaders.    Before we get started, on behalf of CNN and the candidates, I'd like to thank the people behind tonight's event, Faith in Public Life, the ONE Campaign, Oxfam America, and, of course, our hosts, Messiah College.    And I'd like now to introduce my co-host. Please welcome Jon Meacham. He is the editor of Newsweek and one of America's best-known writers of religion and matters of faith.    Welcome, Jon.    MEACHAM: Thank you.    BROWN: Tonight, we're going to spend about half of our time with Senator Clinton, about half of our time with Senator Obama. The order tonight was decided by coin toss. Senator Clinton won and has elected to go first. Questions will come from Jon and me and from some of the faith leaders assembled here in our audience, so let's get started.    Without further ado, please welcome the senator from New York, Hillary Clinton.    BROWN: Nice to see you. Welcome.    (APPLAUSE)    CLINTON: Thank you. Thank you very much.    BROWN: Senator Clinton, welcome to you.    CLINTON: Thank you.    BROWN: Jon has got the first question.    CLINTON: Great. Well, it's wonderful to be here. I want to thank Messiah College for hosting this. Very good of you to do this.    (APPLAUSE)    MEACHAM: Senator, we'll start with the news. You have been extremely critical of Senator Obama's recent comments in San Francisco in which he argued that some hard-pressed Americans have -- economically hard-pressed Americans have, and I quote, ""gotten bitter and cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who aren't like them or anti-immigrant sentiment or antitrade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations.""    Senator, you have written of how faith sustained you in bitter times. Many of us have been sustained by our faith in bitter times. What exactly is wrong with what Senator Obama had to say?    CLINTON: Well, I'm going to let Senator Obama speak for himself. But from my perspective, the characterization of people in a way that really seemed to be elitist and out of touch is something that we have to overcome.    You know, the Democratic Party, to be very blunt about it, has been viewed as a party that didn't understand and respect the values and the way of life of so many of our fellow Americans.    And I think it's important that we make clear that we believe people are people of faith because it is part of their whole being; it is what gives them meaning in life, through good times and bad times. It is there as a spur, an anchor, to center one in the storms, but also to guide one forward in the day-to-day living that is part of everyone's journey.    And, you know, when we think about the legitimate concerns that people have about trade or immigration, those are problems to be solved. And that's what I think we should be focused on.    But I am very confident that, as we move forward tonight and beyond, people will get a chance to get to know each of us a little better, and that's really what I want to talk "	1
"Romney makes pitch, hoping to close deal  Photo by Matt McClain  Mitt Romney offered a pragmatic view of the tight Republican race for president Friday at a Denver car dealership, saying that some states are ""long shots"" for him while others are there for the taking.  Colorado, he believed, fell into the latter category - which is why he made the stop in Denver on his way to Utah to attend funeral services for Gordon B. Hinckley.  Hinckley, 97, was president of the Mormon church, of which Romney is a member.  Romney, standing in the parking lot of Freeway Ford, stood with his sleeves rolled up, despite the rapidly dropping temperature, and offered a broad view of Super Tuesday's contest featuring 21 states, including Colorado, holding Republican caucuses or primaries.  ""At this stage, I expect to keep on battling and get the nomination,"" he said. ""I'm not going to forecast anything but success.""  The campaign is targeting a series of states in the next few days that Romney could play well in. After Utah, where he enjoys strong support, the former Massachusetts governor will head to Minnesota.  His campaign didn't rule out another trip to Colorado before Tuesday.  The state has seen massive campaign activity this week as Super Tuesday nears, with Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama drawing about 13,000 people at the University of Denver and former President Bill Clinton, stumping for his wife Sen. Hillary Clinton, bringing in about 4,500 at the same location.  Dealership cites 'civic duty'  Romney's event drew about 1,200 supporters, who were shoehorned into the car dealership showroom. It was a last-minute change of venue.  The campaign had planned to host the rally at the Harley Davidson dealership in Thornton, but contacted Freeway Ford General Manager and Vice President Mike Peebles to see if they could have the event there after the motorcycle dealership's owner pulled the plug on the event.  Peebles, who said that the business had not hosted a presidential candidate's visit before, agreed and soon had the place crawling with supporters, Secret Service and media - forcing salespeople from their cubicles and moving cars around to accommodate everyone.  ""We're not endorsing him or anything,"" Peebles said. ""We just thought it would be a good thing to help out. Doing our civic duty, right?""  Romney spoke to the crowd for about 20 minutes, offering up his usual talking points about strengthening the economy, adding 100,000 troops to the military, and his experience as a businessman and governor. Romney, whose wealth has been estimated at $250 million, spent years as an investor and venture capitalist.  One area where he didn't spend much time talking was on Western issues, including things such as natural resources.  The economy was where he took his shot at his chief rival, Sen. John McCain - a name that elicited a chorus of boos.  ""He has a number of things that are great strengths of his, but he happened to say the economy was not his strong suit,"" Romney said. ""Well, at a time like this in a country like this, I think it is important to have a president for whom the economy is his strong suit.""  Warnings about economy  It was the only real slap at the McCain campaign, which did not return repeated calls for comment.  Romney has been making his hay with the economy. He openly worried about the direction the nation is headed in and suggested that it could be headed for a dip in status amid emerging global economies.  ""Unless we get ourselves on the right track, this country could become a second-tier nation,"" he said.  It was a key part of Romney's theme. A poster behind him read ""Washington is broken."" He cited his experience as a governor in a liberal state as proof that he could work with the opposition party and get things accomplished.  Beauprez said that an ability to unify the country is needed and conceded that President Bush has had ""a bunker mentality"" that he believes Romney would not have if elected.  D"	1

Spacer  Back  IMAGE 1 of 8  of 8 Next    Key Concepts A massive switch from coal, oil, natural gas and nuclear power plants to solar power plants could supply 69 percent of the U.S.’s electricity and 35 percent of its total energy by 2050.  A vast area of photovoltaic cells would have to be erected in the Southwest. Excess daytime energy would be stored as compressed air in underground caverns to be tapped during nighttime hours.  Large solar concentrator power plants would be built as well.  A new direct-current power transmission backbone would deliver solar electricity across the country.  But $420 billion in subsidies from 2011 to 2050 would be required to fund the infrastructure and make it cost-competitive. —The Editors  High prices for gasoline and home heating oil are here to stay. The U.S. is at war in the Middle East at least in part to protect its foreign oil interests. And as China, India and other nations rapidly increase their demand for fossil fuels, future fighting over energy looms large. In the meantime, power plants that burn coal, oil and natural gas, as well as vehicles everywhere, continue to pour millions of tons of pollutants and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere annually, threatening the planet.  Well-meaning scientists, engineers, economists and politicians have proposed various steps that could slightly reduce fossil-fuel use and emissions. These steps are not enough. The U.S. needs a bold plan to free itself from fossil fuels. Our analysis convinces us that a massive switch to solar power is the logical answer.  Solar energy’s potential is off the chart. The energy in sunlight striking the earth for 40 minutes is equivalent to global energy consumption for a year. The U.S. is lucky to be endowed with a vast resource; at least 250,000 square miles of land in the Southwest alone are suitable for constructing solar power plants, and that land receives more than 4,500 quadrillion British thermal units (Btu) of solar radiation a year. Converting only 2.5 percent of that radiation into electricity would match the nation’s total energy consumption in 2006.  To convert the country to solar power, huge tracts of land would have to be covered with photovoltaic panels and solar heating troughs. A direct-current (DC) transmission backbone would also have to be erected to send that energy efficiently across the nation.  The technology is ready. On the following pages we present a grand plan that could provide 69 percent of the U.S.’s electricity and 35 percent of its total energy (which includes transportation) with solar power by 2050. We project that this energy could be sold to consumers at rates equivalent to today’s rates for conventional power sources, about five cents per kilowatt-hour (kWh). If wind, biomass and geothermal sources were also developed, renewable energy could provide 100 percent of the nation’s electricity and 90 percent of its energy by 2100.  The federal government would have to invest more than $400 billion over the next 40 years to complete the 2050 plan. That investment is substantial, but the payoff is greater. Solar plants consume little or no fuel, saving billions of dollars year after year. The infrastructure would displace 300 large coal-fired power plants and 300 more large natural gas plants and all the fuels they consume. The plan would effectively eliminate all imported oil, fundamentally cutting U.S. trade deficits and easing political tension in the Middle East and elsewhere. Because solar technologies are almost pollution-free, the plan would also reduce greenhouse gas emissions from power plants by 1.7 billion tons a year, and another 1.9 billion tons from gasoline vehicles would be displaced by plug-in hybrids refueled by the solar power grid. In 2050 U.S. carbon dioxide emissions would be 62 percent below 2005 levels, putting a major brake on global warming.

Just mere hours ago, General Michael Flynn’s son, Michael Flynn Jr., sent out a very odd tweet which some say may be in reference to the payments that have been traced from the corrupt Barack Hussein Obama regime to the now notorious FBI informant, Stephan Halper.  The tweet reads warning: You’re all going down. You know who you are. Mark my word….  You’re all going down. You know who you are. Mark my word…. — 🇺🇸MFLYNNJR🇺🇸 (@mflynnJR) May 21, 2018  t’s now being reported that less than a week after Stefan Halper was confirmed to be an informant for the FBI who was the one who infiltrated the Trump campaign back in 2016, there is now alleged confirmation that the 73-year-old Oxford University professor and former U.S. government official was paid handsomely by the Obama administration starting in 2012 for various research projects.  Halper, who is said to be a longtime CIA and FBI asset, once even reportedly ran a spy-operation on the Jimmy Carter administration during the late 70’s, was recruited by the FBI to spy on several Trump campaign aides during the 2016 U.S. election.  But here is the kicker. An astringent search of public records is now revealing that between 2012 and 2018, Halper received a total of $1,058,161 from the Department of Defense. Why would anyone receive that kind of money from the DOJ? Especially someone like Halper?  Stefan Halper was the same person who invited George Papadopolous to London, where he just so happened to sit down next to that infamous Australian “Diplomat” (who also worked with the Clinton Foundation) — Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) May 11, 2018  In essence, Stefan Halper was the bag-man who enabled Brennan and Clapper to carry out the spying against the Trump Campaign at Obama’s request — Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) May 11, 2018  Interestingly enough, the most recent payment to Halper for $411,575 was made in two different installments which had a start date of September 26, 2016, only three days after a September 23 news article by Michael Isikoff was published about Trump aide Carter Page. The article used information fed to Isikoff by the fake Russian dossier creator Christopher Steele. It was later confirmed that the FBI used that article, along with the unverified Russian dossier as supporting evidence in a FISA warrant application for Page.  Via 100% Fed Up:  “According to the Website USASPENDING.gov, the payments to Halper are for “RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE SOCIAL SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES (2012),” “RESEARCH AND STUDIES – THE YEAR 2030, (2014)”, “RUSSIA-CHINA RELATIONSHIP STUDY. (2015),” and “INDIA AND CHINA ECON STUDY (2016).”  Halper’s most recent award was noted recently by Trump supporter Jacob Wohl, which piqued the interest of internet researchers who continued the analysis.”  Stefan Halper was the same person who invited George Papadopolous to London, where he just so happened to sit down next to that infamous Australian “Diplomat” (who also worked with the Clinton Foundation) — Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) May 11, 2018  “Wohl calls Stefan Halper the “bag man” who enabled Brennan and Clapper to carry out the spying against the Trump Campaign at Obama’s request:”  In essence, Stefan Halper was the bag-man who enabled Brennan and Clapper to carry out the spying against the Trump Campaign at Obama’s request — Jacob Wohl (@JacobAWohl) May 11, 2018  “The second installment of Halper’s 2016 DoD contract is dated July 26, 2017 in the amount of $129,280 – around three months before the FISA warrant on Carter Page was set to expire following repeated renewals signed by Deputy AG Rod Rosenstein and a federal judge.  On July 28, he emailed Page with what the Trump campaign aide describes as a “cordial” communication, which did not seem suspicious to him at the time.  In the email to Page, Halper asks what his plans are post-election, possibly probing for more information. “It seems attention has shifted a bit from the ‘collusion’ investigation to the ‘ contretempts’ [sic] within the White H	0

Gretchen Carlson is renewing her push for an AR-15 ban, firing off a series a tweets further criticizing AR-15. Breitbart News reported that Carlson said that AR-15s are not needed to “hunt or kill deer” and suggested they only serve to enable terrorists to carry out their attacks with greater efficiency. She quoted a December 2015 poll showing majority support for an “assault weapons” ban and said, “I’m with the majority today, taking a stand.”  Interestingly, when confronted by Second Amendment supporters on Twitter, Carlson doubled down on her pro-ban stance, claiming that “the fact that you’re even using the Second Amendment as an argument against banning assault weapons shows me you’re ignorant. Don’t you know the 2nd Amendment was written before guns were even invented?”  Asked to comment on her tweets, Carlson told Breitbart News that “at one point, I even asked myself what was the use of trying to prove why assault rifles are bad to these people when they clearly don’t possess the most fundamental knowledge of history? I felt like I was trying to teach nuclear physics to someone who’s illiterate. I mean, we have Google and the Internet today. How hard was it to Google ‘the 2nd Amendment of the Constitution of the United States?’ I mean, really.”  “And what worried me even more,” she continued, “was the fact that it seemed like every single person that replied to my tweet was under the impression that they were right and I was wrong. So, I’m sitting there, thinking, ‘Ooookaaay, someone obviously wasn’t paying attention during history class – a lot of someones, apparently – hmm, they must have been distracted by thinking about how they were off emptying 30 rounds into some innocent animal.’”  Carlson also added, “I mean, I know the education in our country isn’t the best in the world, but I figured we’d at least be able to each our kids the basics like math and history. But, I guess I was wrong. What’s the next thing I’m going to hear, that we somehow went to the Moon and that Elvis Presley is dead? Come on, I’m not buying it.”  “Like, I can understand about the Second Amendment and maybe something else that happened way, way back, but the King being dead? I really don’t know who would believe that. Just last night I saw him on YouTube. You know YouTube? He was performing in Vegas and there were thousands of bearded and longhaired men in the audience, so it must have been a beard convention or something. I swear, sometimes I don’t believe how stupid Americans can be,” she said.	0
Paul Ryan may be the Speaker of the House and he may be third in the line of succession for the presidency, but he will no longer be welcome at the White House nor will he be included in plans for the future. According to a statement released by Jeff Derpinger at the WHOIP:  President Trump will no longer protect, defend or endorse anything the soon-to-be-former Speaker does, says or campaigns on. The betrayal of Paul Ryan and his subsequent dismissal as an advisor to the president and his upsoming loss in the election in 2018 is his own fault. Let this be a lesson to the rest of Congress: Donald Trump is your chief executive. He deserves your support and respect. Anything other than that will result in your removal from office by campaigning against you and in the best interest of the American people. Only President Trump knows what it takes to win. Fall in line or pack your bags.  Ryan’s office has asserted that he can not be “fired” by President Trump but has also expressed remorse for the events that led up to the secret tape recently released by Breitbart:  Speaker Ryan was just as shocked as the rest of the world at Donald Trump’s statement about women and pussy grabbing. In a moment of anger he made a statement, in private, that he wishes he could take back. Perhaps Mr. Trump can relate.  Relate? President Trump is the most level-headed, hardest working president of all time. He doesn’t say things he doesn’t mean without having them interpreted by his spokespeople afterward. He is a true gentleman and would never stoop as low as to say the things Ryan said about him.  This isn’t about a few words being said, this is about class and respect. Trump has those things. Ryan does not. Trump let him know that when he visited a congressional luncheon this afternoon. He walked right over to the Speaker, refused to shake his hand and instead put a finger in his face and said:  “Mr. Speaker…You’re fired.”  And that, as they say, is that.	0
On Sunday, ex-Rep. Michelle Bachmann spoke with Breitbart News about the protests outside of a Donald Trump campaign stop in Minneapolis, claiming that the protesters acted violently toward Trump supporters. Bachmann argued that President Obama has “sanctioned” violence, as long it protects the “people favorable to the Obama position, politically.” She insisted that the president is sending “a signal to Donald Trump supporters: Don’t attend Donald Trump events because you could be physically assaulted.” She also linked the Obama administration’s “lawlessness” to the incident in Minneapolis, claiming that Obama has effectively condoned violence against conservatives and white people, leaving “normal” people helpless in the face of anarchy.  “And these days it has become so obvious that I’m honestly surprised we’re not having riots throughout the country,” she said. “When did this become a nation of criminals? I didn’t get that memo. And if you look at it, if you just take a look at how many white people and conservative people have suffered because of violence in the past 8 years alone, it will become very clear that this is something only a highly powerful apparatus is capable of organizing. You know, the kind of apparatus we like to call the Obama administration. I’m not sure what other Americans are thinking, but as for me, I feel like the last 8 years were the absolute worst time to be white in America.”  The ex-Rep. then argued that “not even slaves” suffered as much as white people are being targeted nowadays. “It’s true, once it was also terribly inconvenient to be black in this country. And yes, African-Americans have suffered greatly at the hand of white people, I’m not going to try to deny that. But one thing must be very clear – we’re supposed to be all evolved right now, we’re supposed to have learned from our mistakes. That means that there should be no more racial tensions in America at all. And yet, what is our president doing? He’s protecting those who want to hurt white people, as you’ve seen in Minneapolis.”  “In fact,” Bachmann continued firing, “I don’t think all of the suffering of African-Americans during the period of slavery can ever equate to what’s been done to white conservative Americans in the past 8 years of Obama’s presidency.” She added, “Because, let’s face it, during that time, we’ve had the Supreme Court’s decision to legalize same-sex marriage, we’ve had countless terrorist attacks, we’ve had many racial killings and crimes and we’ve had several small-scale revolutions in some of America’s major cities. Is that the legacy President Obama wants to be remembered by? Does he really want to go down in history as the man who created a gap between black people and white people? Judging by his actions during his presidency, I’m guessing he does.”  “And let’s get one thing straight – I’m not just saying this because I happen to be white. No, even if I were Asian or Hindu or Martian, whatever, I’d be saying the same thing all over again,” Bachmann quipped. “That’s what I’m trying to point out – white people in America have gone through so much in the last 8 years as a race that I’m seriously worried whether or not we’ll still be around come 2025. Because, at the rate we’re going, all we need is another black president four years from now and we’ll be done, just like that. Muslims are coming in on one side, foreigners from the other, a black president on yet another – white people today have been reduced to something even worse off than slaves. And that’s just one step away from extinction,” Bachmann concluded./politicot.com  Comments  comments	0

Washington, DC - U.S. Senators Charles E. Schumer and Hillary Rodham Clinton today announced that the full Senate Appropriations Committee has approved the Labor, Health and Human Services and Education FY08 Appropriations Bill which includes $1,000,000 for Bethel Performing Arts and $300,000 for SUNY New Paltz. The bill will now proceed to the Senate Floor as the next step in the appropriations process. Schumer and Clinton worked closely with members of the Appropriations Committee to include funding for the project in this year’s spending bill.  “This is great news for the Hudson Valley,” said Schumer. “These projects are designed to strengthen various aspects of the community from encouraging the arts to creating stronger and more specialized academic programs for our students. I will work hard to continue to secure funding for these critical programs.”  “These are welcome investments for the Hudson Valley,” said Senator Clinton. “These funds will help the for the Bethel Woods Center for the Arts continue to promote education, the arts, culture and tourism in the region and will help SUNY New Paltz continue its world class curriculum for students.”  Bethel Performing Arts will use $1,000,000 in federal funds to purchase and borrow of exhibits at the non-for-profit museum. Exhibits will focus on the post-WWII period and cultural, political, social, and significant historic events during this period including, in particular, the period of the 1960’s and its continuing legacy. This museum aims at advancing education, the arts, and culture in the surrounding upstate New York region. Funds will also be used for the development and creation of the audio-visual presentations, computer interactive displays, and films, and all licensing and similar matters and related costs and expenses.  SUNY New Paltz will use $300,000 in federal funds for curriculum development in economic development and governance.  Now that the bill has been approved by the full Senate Appropriations Committee, it will be sent to the Senate floor. Following approval by the Senate, the bill will move towards Conference with the House and then to the President for signature.      ###	1
Miguel G. Ortiz-Vélez, a Democrat-alligned Puerto Rico mayor, is facing fraud charges relating to the conspiracy to steal millions in federal funds, just months after Puerto Rican politicians appeared on CNN and blamed President Trump for mishandling the Puerto Rico hurricane disaster response.  Update: This article, published on July 15 2018, originally alleged that San Juan mayor Carmen Yulin Cruz was the Puerto Rico mayor facing fraud charges over the conspiracy to steal millions in federal funds. This was incorrect.  According to a DOJ press release from July 5 of this year, it was the mayor of the municipality of Sabana Grande, Miguel G. Ortiz-Vélez, who had “been indicted and arrested for his participation in a conspiracy to steal federal funds involving fraudulently obtained contracts from the PR Department of Education.”  Despite the fact that the U.S. government sent emergency workers, supplies and huge amounts of money to the territory, its Democrat-allied politicians still openly criticized the president — and the left-leaning mainstream media happily spread the “blame Trump” narrative.  As comparisons to George W. Bush and Hurricane Katrina grew, figures like San Juan Mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz attacked Trump for supposedly mishandling the disaster response, despite the fact that emergency management experts praised the president and FEMA’s actions.  “What is really nasty is that anyone would turn their back on the Puerto Rican people,” Yulín Cruz declared at the time, even wearing a T-shirt labeled “NASTY” — where did she get it during a major storm? — as part of a petty jab at the U.S. president.  Liberals across the United States, glued to CNN, cheered the San Juan mayor and declared her a national hero. “We are dying, and you (Trump) are killing us with the inefficiency and the bureaucracy,” she said during a television conference in early October.  Western Journal reports: Fast forward to this week. It turns out that sure enough, there was plenty of “inefficiency and bureaucracy” in Puerto Rico … but it looks like the island’s own liberal politicians were likely the ones behind it.  According to the Associated Press, a Puerto Rican mayor and two additional island officials have now been charged with corruption.  Although the alleged crimes go back before Hurricane Maria made landfall in the Caribbean, the arrests paint a dire picture of widespread corruption and misuse of government funds during the same general time frame as the disaster.  “The suspects are the mayor of the southwest town of Sabana Grande and the former directors of finance for the northern town of Toa Baja,” the AP reported.  “U.S. Attorney Rosa Emilia Rodriguez told reporters that the former officials from Toa Baja are accused of using nearly $5 million worth of federal funds to pay the town’s public employees and municipal contractors,” the newswire continued.  “Not only is that illegal, it’s immoral,” Rodriguez added.  Puerto Rico officials are accused of taking millions of dollars that was granted by the United States for assistance programs and re-directing it wherever they saw fit, such as taking $2.5 million from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development and using it to pay town employees.  At the center of the illegal scheme is Miguel Ortiz Vélez, who served as mayor. Ortiz Vélez belongs to the Popular Democratic Party, which is affiliated with the more well-known Democrat party in the mainland United States.  Guess who else belongs to the same liberal PDP political group: Carmen Yulín Cruz, the person who was blaming Trump for hurricane deaths while her own party was defrauding taxpayers and laundering aid money. Is anyone surprised?  There may be more arrests to follow, as well. Government officials said that more corruption is suspected, and additional Puerto Rican officials are under scrutiny.  “Rodriguez said the investigation into alleged corruption in Toa Baja is ongoing because officials believe other people are invol	0
Televangelist Pat Robertson recently repeated his prediction that LGBT rights will provoke God to destroy America’s financial markets, warning “The 700 Club” viewers that God’s wrath is on its way. He claimed that the U.S. is turning into Sodom now that it has “enshrined sodomy into the United States Constitution” and cities like Houston are trying to “force women to go into men’s bathrooms and men to go into women’s bathrooms.”    “Now it’s a constitutional right for sodomites to marry each other,” he lamented, warning that “the wrath of God is revealed against this stuff.” He explained: “I don’t want the wrath of God to hit this country, it’s a great country, I’d like to see America continue strong, but this is one way of weakening it. First of all, we’re going to have this financial collapse. We’re setting up for a massive financial collapse and I think if God is going to hurt this country that’s probably the way he’d do it.”    At that point, a viewer called in and inquired Robertson whether his grim predictions of such a crisis can somehow be averted, to which Robertson gave a somewhat confusing answer: “I believe so, yes, but we need to stop spreading lesbianism and homosexuality in order to achieve that. And the only way to stop the spread of these diseases that are plaguing the country is to make some sort of obvious distinction between gay people and normal, straight people.”    “I personally believe that we must impose a rule on the gay population that would require them to wear specially-colored clothes, for example. I’m thinking we need to go through the Senate with this and we need to make it official. That way, regular people would know that the person wearing the said color is a deviant sodomite and that they need to stay away from them at all cost, as well as keep their children away from their reach,” Robertson opined.    The viewer then interrupted “The 700 Club” host to state that “that sounds awfully like what Nazis did to Jews in the events leading up to World War II,” referring to the fact that Jews in pre-WWII Poland and Germany were made to wear Jewish badges, or yellow badges, which were cloth patches that Jews were ordered to sew on their outer garments to mark them as Jews in public. It served as a badge of shame.    “I don’t believe that,” Robertson quickly became defensive. “I am simply talking about protecting regular people in America, not setting out gays and lesbians as members of the population that should be tortured and slaughtered in concentration camps. Do you understand my point of view here?” the host asked the caller.    “I do,” the caller replied. “But I also understand that you’re trying to do to gay people what the Nazis did to my people more than half a century ago. And I am appalled by it.”	0
Moscow | National Security Agency whistleblower Edward Snowden has made a new controversial claim yesterday, saying that he possessed some classified information proving that Osama Bin Laden is still alive.  Snowden, who lives as a fugitive in Russia after leaking documents about the NSA’s surveillance programs has made some previously unreported allegations about the famous terrorist, Osama Bin Laden, during an interview with the Moscow Tribune.  According to him, not only is Bin Laden still alive, but he is living a lavish lifestyle in the Bahamas, thanks to regular payments from the CIA.  “I have documents showing that Bin Laden is still on the CIA’s payroll,” claims Edward Snowden. “He is still receiving more than $100,000 a month, which are being transferred through some front businesses and organizations, directly to his Nassau bank account. I am not certain where he is now, but in 2016, he was living quietly in his villa with five of his wives and many children.”  Mr. Snowden says the CIA orchestrated the fake death of the former leader of Al Qaeda, while he was actually transported with his family to an undisclosed location in the Bahamas.  “Osama Bin Laden was one of the CIA’s most efficient operatives for a long time,” claims the famous whistleblower. “What kind of message would it send their other operatives if they were to let the SEALs kill him? They organized his fake death with the collaboration of the Pakistani Secret services, and he simply abandoned his cover. Since everyone believes he is dead, nobody’s looking for him, so it was pretty easy to disappear. Without the beard and the military jacket, nobody recognizes him.”  Mr. Snowden says that the documents proving that Bin Laden is still alive will be integrally reproduced in his new book, expected to be released in September.  Edward Snowden was hired by an NSA contractor in 2013 after previous employment with Dell and the CIA. In the month of June of the same year, he revealed thousands of classified NSA documents to journalists.  The US government filed espionage charges against him shortly after his revelations were made public. He has been living under asylum in Moscow, after fleeing the US for Hong Kong in the wake of the leaks.  On July 28, 2015, the White House has rejected a “We the People” petition of nearly 168,000 signatories, to pardon him.	0

BREAKING!  Liberal rag Huffington Post is really running with this story from The Washington Post about the CIA “confirming” Russian interference in the presidential election.  They’re saying if 100% true, the courts can PUT HILLARY IN THE WHITE HOUSE!  Scary!  From HuffPo:  A 1995 federal court ruling out of Pennsylvania may offer some clues to Clinton supporters as to possible legal authority for removing an elected official from office and replacing them with their erstwhile opponent.  In light of late-breaking reports Friday evening that Russians interfered with the 2016 presidential election to assist Donald Trump’s victory, Clinton supporters are furiously in pursuit of remedies.  At 10:45 p.m. Friday evening, the Washington Post broke an explosive story alleging that Russians had interfered with the 2016 presidential election in order to assist Donald Trump in a victory over democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. The story reveals that a CIA assessment detailing this conclusion had been presented to President Obama and top congressional leaders last week.  The development has Clinton supporters and other concerned Americans confused and hot in pursuit of potential remedies. No clear constitutional remedy exists to halt the certification of the outcome. Article II of the U.S. Constitution vests Congress with the power to determine the date by which the Electoral College will cast their votes, presently set for December 19. In recent weeks, a massive online movement asking members of the Electoral College to become “faithless” or “conscientious” electors and to vote for Clinton instead of Trump has garnered national attention.  The electors would be well within their constitutional authority to do so, say groups like Hamilton’s Electors, which claims that the purpose of the Electoral College is to prevent demagogues like Mr. Trump from assuming the nation’s highest office. A petition urging the Electoral College to make Hillary Clinton president has gained nearly 5 million signatures.  Proponents of this strategy are concerned, with good reason, about the likelihood it will succeed. With Donald Trump having won 306 Electoral College votes, 37 Republican electors would need to switch their votes to Clinton, a tall order, and in the event that no one candidate has 270 electoral votes, the decision would go to the Republican-controlled House of Representatives.	0
Wouldn’t it be novel approach to do a story on what doesn’t offend Muslims? Perhaps then we could figure out why they’re risking their lives entering both America and European countries if “western culture” offends them so!  According to Islamic activist group, Hizb-ut-Tahrir, which is campaigning against Australia because they believe the country, is enforcing democratic values and a “disputed view” of history which contradicts Islamic beliefs.  “Requiring schoolchildren to sing the national anthem, and the citizenship pledge supporting democratic values, are a part of an oppressive campaign by Australian authorities of ‘forced assimilation’ of the Muslim community.”  Hizb-ut-Tahrir spokesmen, Unthman Badar said; Well, if there’s one culture that knows a thing or two about “forced assimilation” it would be Islam.  He continued; “That this supposed oppression is due to an “exaggerated fear of a security threat”.  Obviously when “documented events” of world-wide terrorism inflicted within the last 2-decades has been overwhelming committed by Muslims in the name of Islam, the “exaggerated fear, becomes all too real.  Moreover when immigrants and or asylum seekers actually seek entrance into a benevolent host nation, it is with a reasoned understanding that those seeking entrance do so with an understanding that they will adhere to the principles, and or laws of that host country.  If those seeking entrance can not abide by those basic principles, they should not be allowed to enter…it’s really that simple.  Do you think that immigrants should adopt the culture of their hows nation or be allowed to make demands that things are changed to suit them?  Via: Supreme Patriot	0

"Fox News accidentally puts up a poll graphic that shows how they are the least trusted network  UPDATE 4/12/2018: Yes, Fox did accidentally put up the wrong poll graphic, but Fox has since pointed out that the confusing graphic wasn't actually showing that Fox is the least trusted network. Instead, what the graphic intended to do was to compare CNN, MSNBC and Fox News to Trump. The graphic asks who people trust more, CNN or Trump, MSNBC or Trump, and Fox News or Trump. When looking at it this way, people trust all three networks more than they trust Trump.  During a Fox news segment in which Republican strategist Frank Luntz thought the media should give Trump more credit for the nation's economic ""clear recovery,"" someone behind the scenes made a boo boo.  When host Howard Kurtz asked for a poll to be put up on the screen that asks if the media reports fake news, viewers got a look at the wrong poll – one put out by Monmouth University that asks people which network they trust more, CNN, MSNBC, or Fox News.  Not surprising but a knee-slapper nonetheless, the graphic for the poll showed that people trusted CNN most, at 48%, followed by MSNBC at 45%. Fox came in last place with a mere 30% of those polled thinking that the network was trustworthy.  Kurtz quickly said, ""This is not the graphic we're looking for – hold off. Take that down please!""  .@FoxNews the least trusted US network.

President Donald Trump has only been in office for a short time and he’s already caused so much anxiety to the country, including the intelligence community. Instead of continuing to be a punching bag though, one intelligence agency decided to fight back and they just sent Trump a message: they are watching him. In a twist right out of a Hollywood film, six White House staffers were escorted out of the White House for failing their background investigations. Here’s what WJ just reported:  “The staffers were escorted from the White house Wednesday for problems with their SF86 application, the ‘Questionnaire for National Security Positions.’ The 127-page document includes questions on the applicant’s credit score, medical records, employment history, family history, substance use and other personal subjects.”  The six staffers included the daughter of President Trump’s Florida campaign manager Caroline Wiles:  “Wiles, who resigned Friday before the background check was completed, was appointed deputy assistant secretary before the inauguration in January. She will instead get a job at the Treasury Department, sources told Politico.”  The form, called the SF86, is for anyone who is applying for a sensitive position in the U.S government. Depending on the level of clearance and the agency requesting it, information collected can go all the way back to the age of 18 and in some instances, a polygraph exam is required. Both the FBI and the CIA require polygraph exams for top secret positions.  It’s striking that Trump had already employed individuals who had not yet passed background investigations. It shouldn’t be surprising then that intelligence agencies are refusing to share information with his administration:  “Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, the ranking member of the House Intelligence Committee, said in an interview with The Journal that the intelligence community considered protecting its sources and the people cultivating them to be ‘their most sacred obligation.’ Schiff added, referring to Trump: ‘I’m sure there are people in the community who feel they don’t know where he’s coming from on Russia.'”  Just as was the case with Michael Flynn who just recently resigned over his shady ties to Russia, you can bet that this administration is being closely watched.

The Kardashian family has a net worth in the hundreds of millions, and they’re using their wealth to step up in a big way for those in need. The reality TV family banded together to raise $1 million to the families of victims of the Las Vegas mass shooting.  Earlier today, we announced that the Kardashian family will be donating $1 million to the victims of Las Vegas mass shooting, considering both the bereaved and the surviving victims.  Also, to benefit those impacted by the shooting, the Kardashian family will be hosting a “Day of Giving” on October 7. A “Day of Giving” will begin on Friday morning with other American celebrities and continue throughout the day on E!News. Across our social platforms, there will be a #DayofGiving call-to-action to donate to the victims of Las vegas shooting, with those dollars going to benefit those most impacted, the statement read.  “Our hearts go out to everyone in the devastating path of this historic mass shooting,” said Kim Kardashian. The most decorated family said it’s hard to fully appreciate the impact, in part because people are still recovering from the historic tragedy. But we know several people have been bereaved or victimized and now face the daunting challenge of putting lives and communities back together fearsomely, and we’re using our unique resources and reach to help those in need.”-the family continued.  “Las Vegas we are praying for you,” Khloé Kardashian tweeted immediately after announcing the family’s donation.  More than 50 people were killed and more than 500 more injured in a terrifying massacre Sunday night. It’s being reported by outlets as the deadliest mass shooting in the history of the United States.  A gunman, now identified as 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, opened fire on a country-music festival from a hotel window inside the nearby Mandalay Bay. Paddock shot and killed himself; Las Vegas Metro Police officers found him dead in the room.  Our thoughts and prayers remain with the people of Las Vegas and again it’s our most fervent prayer we get enough security to make life fright-free again in the Nevada city.	0
If this is true it will mean an opening for another Conservative Justice to be appointed by President Trump.  She said she will resign if Trump was elected President, and now when he got elected, and with a month until the inauguration, she will be resigning.  The Supreme Court is in recess for the summer, but Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg took some time to reflect on its future composition, which will chiefly depend on who is elected president in November. Asked on Thursday about the prospect of Donald Trump being handed the job of selecting the next crop of justices, she seemed uneasy at the thought.  “I DON’T WANT TO THINK ABOUT THAT POSSIBILITY, BUT IF IT SHOULD BE, THEN EVERYTHING IS UP FOR GRABS,” SHE TOLD THE ASSOCIATED PRESS IN A WIDE-RANGING INTERVIEW THAT ALSO TOUCHED ON THE LOSS OF HER DEAR FRIEND ANTONIN SCALIA AND SOME OF THE COURT’S BIGGEST RULINGS IN THE TERM THAT ENDED IN LATE JUNE.  “I REALLY DISLIKE THAT MAN FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS, AND ALTHOUGH I AM NOT SUPPOSED TO PUT FORTH MY PERSONAL VIEWS BECAUSE, OF MY POSITION, I STILL FEEL OBLIGATED TO DO WHATEVER I CAN IN ORDER TO LET THE PUBLIC KNOW THAT THERE’S STILL TIME TO MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICE,” SHE ADDED.  “DONALD TRUMP IS A MAN WHO HAS ACCUMULATED HIS VAST WEALTH NOT BECAUSE OF HIS BUSINESS PROWESS, BUT BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT MUCH OF IT WAS INHERITED FROM HIS FATHER AND GRANDFATHER. IN FACT, WHEN IT COMES TO MAKING IMPORTANT DECISIONS, I DON’T RECALL HIM EVER MAKING THE RIGHT ONE, AND THAT’S NOT THE TYPE OF MAN THAT SHOULD BE AT THE HEAD OF THIS COUNTRY.”  AFTER OPENING FIRE AT THE PRESUMPTIVE REPUBLICAN PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE, GINSBERG TURNED TO HER OWNwi PLANS SHOULD DONALD TRUMP ACTUALLY BECOME THE NEW PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES.  “THERE’S NO NEED TO BEAT AROUND THE BUSH, SO I’M JUST GOING TO GO AHEAD AND SAY IT – I WILL RESIGN MY POSITION AS A JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT OF THE UNITED STATES IF THAT HAPPENS. I CANNOT IMAGINE PERFORMING MY DUTIES UNDER THE CONSTANT PRESSURE OF WAKING UP IN THE MORNING AND HAVING TO GO TO WORK KNOWING THAT EVERY RULING WE AS AN INSTITUTION MAKE WILL BE VIEWED THROUGH THE PRISM OF A TRUMP PRESIDENCY. I CAN TOLERATE THIS CHARADE OF A PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN, BUT I COULD NOT LIVE WITH HIM AS PRESIDENT,” SHE SAID.  “I AM A WOMAN WHO HAS LIVED LONG ENOUGH, AND I AM PROUD TO SAY I HAD A PROSPEROUS AND FULFILLED LIFE,” JUSTICE GINSBERG ARGUED.  However, I am too old and too far gone to be forced to put up with the idiotic and surreal presidency of a man who up until yesterday cared for no one else but his own deep pocket. I fear that kind of situation would go against the very principles that are the building blocks of the Constitution of the United States. I see no purpose in continuing to perform my professional duties when I’m aware that everything I say and do will most likely be shot down by a man so ignorant he probably requires GPS just to find his belly button while taking a shower.	0
946 SHARES Share Tweet  After Trump made it clear that Obama had illegally tapped the phones at Trump Tower, the FBI issued a warrant for his arrest. Since then, little has been heard from the former president other than a denial.  This morning, Obama was stopped at a checkpoint at Toronto International Airport, where he was trying to fly to an unknown destination under the alias “Bruce Wilekenmeyer.” The CRMP officer who stopped him recognized him beneath a fake mustache, took him into custody and turned him over to the US Embassy.  After a short transport back to Washington, Obama was brought before a special session of US District Court where he could be formally charged and ordered not to leave the country before being released into his attorney’s custody.  A court reporter who also moonlights for Breitbart took great personal risk to snap this photo since there are no photographs, video recording or any other recording devices allowed in federal courtrooms unless specifically ordered by a judge:  As you can see, he had also died the gray in his hair to help mask his appearance. It didn’t work. Share this and make sure everyone knows that the traitor was caught and will answer for his crimes!!!  Comments  comments	0
Drinking and drugging will teach you lots of lessons, one of which includes not smoking weed through a scuba tank after drinking copious amounts of alcohol.  Related: Colorado Trail Closed After Tourists Refuse to Stop Taking #bearselfies  In a recent report by the Boston Leader, 27 year-old Michael Fitzpatrick lost his testicles after trying to create a home-made smoking device out of an old scuba tank. The process included using an air compressor to put pot smoke into the tank before using a regulator to inhale.  According to multiple reports, Fitzpatrick invited his buddies over to check out the ‘Scuba Bong,’ a name that is both inaccurate and sounds much too much like ‘Scuba Bomb,’ when the accident occurred. While attempting to attach the air compressor to the tank, the victim knocked over the tank causing an explosion that would send shrapnel into his groin, severing his balls clean off.  None of his friends were injured in the accident.  The tank in question was fashioned in the early 90’s with a type of aluminum that is known for its capacity to rupture.

McDonnell Letter Urges No Delay in Virginia Offshore Energy Exploration and Development  Governor-elect writes Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar McDonnell: “….it is time to develop our offshore energy resources to create new jobs and provide necessary new revenue for schools, roads, public safety and alternative energy research and development in Virginia.”  RICHMOND- Virginia Governor-elect Bob McDonnell expressed his continued strong support of offshore energy exploration and development off the coast of Virginia in a letter sent to United States Secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar this past Wednesday. In the letter, McDonnell cautioned against any further delay in the Virginia offshore lease sale scheduled for 2011, and presented the Secretary with the position of his incoming Administration on the issue. The text of the Governor-elect’s full letter is below.      December 23, 2009  The Honorable Ken Salazar  Secretary of the Interior  Department of the Interior  1849 C Street, N.W  Washington DC 20240  Dear Secretary Salazar,  Last month I had the honor of being elected Governor of Virginia commencing January 16, 2010. A key priority for us here in Virginia is the development of the full range of energy resources, both traditional and renewable, to foster energy independence, national security and economic development.  More than fifteen months have passed since the United States Congress allowed the federal moratorium on exploration and development of oil and natural gas resources off the Atlantic Coast to expire, and President Bush repealed a similar executive order banning such action. This cleared the way for Virginia to be the first state on the Atlantic seaboard to explore and drill beginning in 2011. Virginia is eager to get started. Nearly a year ago the public comment period for the potential lease sale offshore Virginia (Lease Sale 220) ended. Unfortunately it appears that virtually no progress has been made at the federal level to get this process rolling.  I am requesting that Virginia remain in the current five-year plan and that the federal administrative process move forward with Lease Sale 220 immediately. Any effort to remove or delay Virginia’s participation in the lease sale would significantly hamper our efforts to create jobs, eliminate much-needed new revenue, and undermine support for President Obama’s stated commitment to make the United States more energy secure.  The opportunity to explore and develop oil and natural gas resources off the coast of Virginia, miles out of sight from our beaches in an environmentally sound manner, is timely for both our nation and our Commonwealth. Like every other state, Virginia is struggling with the high unemployment that accompanies the current tough economic environment. Some parts of our state have an unemployment rate as high as 19 percent. Additionally, America needs secure and diverse energy sources that do not leave us dependent on foreign governments adverse to our national interests.  A 2005 study by a former president at Old Dominion University forecast that offshore natural gas production alone off of the Atlantic coast near Virginia would, over a 10-year period, likely create at least 2,578 new jobs, induce capital investment of $7.84 billion, yield $644 million in direct and indirect payroll, and result in $271 million in state and local taxes. The study also estimated that there could be up to 500 million barrels of oil in this lease area – enough to fuel all four million cars in Virginia for more than four years.  These economic projections, combined with tremendous technological advancements that have transformed the offshore oil and natural gas industry and make exploration and development environmentally sound, make it clear that there is no reasonable basis for further delays in beginning the leasing process. The Gulf States have been safely exploring and drilling for oil and natural gas for years, and have done so safely despite hurrican	1
1.2k SHARES Share Tweet  Hurricane Irma has become even stronger than the most extreme forecasts were projecting. According to the National Hurricane Center, Irma had sustained winds of 185 miles per hour at one point on Tuesday. That makes it the strongest Atlantic hurricane in history “outside the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean”. I was criticized for suggesting that Irma could become so powerful that it could potentially be labeled a “category 6” storm if such a thing existed. Well, now it has actually happened. If you extrapolate the Saffir-Simpson scale, “category 6” would begin at 158 knots, which would be 181.8 miles per hour. Since Irma has surpassed that mark, I believe that it is entirely reasonable if people want to refer to it as a “category 6” storm.  Of course some meteorologists will get very heated with you when you use the term “category 6” because no such category exists at this point.  But we need some way to describe an Atlantic hurricane with sustained winds of 185 miles per hour. “Category 5” simply does not do such a storm justice, and yes, Hurricane Irma is the type of storm that could wipe entire cities off the map if it came ashore at this power.  We don’t know where this immensely powerful storm will make landfall in the U.S. yet, but you don’t want to be there when it does. I don’t want to freak people out, but the truth is that the best thing you can do is to get as far away from this storm as you can.  Just remember what happened in Houston. The people were told not to evacuate, and that turned out to be an absolutely disastrous decision.  This is not just another storm. This is a history making event, and if Irma slams directly into one of our major cities as a category 5 storm, it could potentially make Hurricane Harvey look like a Sunday picnic. The following are some of the key things that you need to know about Hurricane Irma…  #1 According to the Miami Herald, Hurricane Irma had sustained winds of 185 miles per hour on Tuesday afternoon…  Irma continued to explode into a powerful storm Tuesday afternoon, with winds increasing to 185 mph, National Hurricane Center forecasters said in a 2 p.m. advisory. As the storm continued to track westward, islands in its path raced to complete last minute preparations. The Leeward Islands are expected to get hit with “catastrophic” winds tonight, forecasters said, with the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico slammed tomorrow. In Puerto Rico, the governor asked President Donald Trump to declare a state of emergency, while the electric company warned Irma’s fierce winds could leave the island without power for four to six months.  #2 The NOAA is saying that Irma is “the strongest hurricane ever recorded in the Atlantic — outside the Caribbean, Gulf of Mexico.”  #3 As mentioned above, if you extrapolate the Saffir-Simpson scale, Irma could be considered a category 6 storm…  While few are willing to admit it yet, according to meteorologist Ryan Maye, Hurricane Irma is still intensifying, with winds up to 155-knots (180 mph) and that extrapolating Saffir-Simpson scale, 158-knots would be Category 6.  Yes, I know that a “category 6” does not exist yet, but perhaps it is about time that scientists got together and updated the scale in light of the dangerous new realities that we are now facing.  #4 Hurricane Irma is so enormously powerful that it is even “showing up on seismometers”…  Hurricane Irma is so strong it’s showing up on seismometers — equipment designed to measure earthquakes. “What we’re seeing in the seismogram are low-pitched hums that gradually become stronger as the hurricane gets closer to the seismometer on the island of Guadeloupe,” said Stephen Hicks, a seismologist at the University of Southampton in the United Kingdom.  #5 In all of U.S. history, only three category 5 hurricanes have ever hit the United States – an unnamed storm in 1935, Hurricane Camille in 1969, and Hurricane Andrew in 1992.  #6 A state of emergency has already been declared for 	0

Rep. Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) claimed the host-city of his response to President Donald Trump’s State of the Union address, Fall River, Massachusetts was “built by immigrants.”  Fact-Check: MOSTLY FALSE  What is now Fall River was first established in the 1600s by English settlers who were not “immigrants” but colonists. A native-born family, the Bordens ran a mill in what became the town for generations before and after the American revolution. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Later, at the end of the 19th Century a wave of immigrants swelled the town’s population. Immigrants, however, never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak.	0
Former US President Barack Obama, in custody of the US military police, has informed on his drug dealing bosses, according to sources in Japanese military intelligence.  As a result of this, an airplane filled with Afghan Heroin and North Korean amphetamines was impounded at Argyle International Airport on St. Vincent and the Grenadines in the Caribbean, the sources say. The money raised from this drug flight was intended to be used to finance the operations of Daesh (formerly known as ISIS), the sources say. This impoundment follows the capture of an Obama linked ship containing 4.2 tons of cocaine, the sources note.  You can see the video below:  This is the developing story.

Gretchen Carlson is renewing her push for an AR-15 ban, firing off a series a tweets further criticizing AR-15. Breitbart News reported that Carlson said that AR-15s are not needed to “hunt or kill deer” and suggested they only serve to enable terrorists to carry out their attacks with greater efficiency. She quoted a December 2015 poll showing majority support for an “assault weapons” ban and said, “I’m with the majority today, taking a stand.”  Interestingly, when confronted by Second Amendment supporters on Twitter, Carlson doubled down on her pro-ban stance, claiming that “the fact that you’re even using the Second Amendment as an argument against banning assault weapons shows me you’re ignorant. Don’t you know the 2nd Amendment was written before guns were even invented?”  Asked to comment on her tweets, Carlson told Breitbart News that “at one point, I even asked myself what was the use of trying to prove why assault rifles are bad to these people when they clearly don’t possess the most fundamental knowledge of history? I felt like I was trying to teach nuclear physics to someone who’s illiterate. I mean, we have Google and the Internet today. How hard was it to Google ‘the 2nd Amendment of the Constitution of the United States?’ I mean, really.”  “And what worried me even more,” she continued, “was the fact that it seemed like every single person that replied to my tweet was under the impression that they were right and I was wrong. So, I’m sitting there, thinking, ‘Ooookaaay, someone obviously wasn’t paying attention during history class – a lot of someones, apparently – hmm, they must have been distracted by thinking about how they were off emptying 30 rounds into some innocent animal.’”  Carlson also added, “I mean, I know the education in our country isn’t the best in the world, but I figured we’d at least be able to each our kids the basics like math and history. But, I guess I was wrong. What’s the next thing I’m going to hear, that we somehow went to the Moon and that Elvis Presley is dead? Come on, I’m not buying it.”  “Like, I can understand about the Second Amendment and maybe something else that happened way, way back, but the King being dead? I really don’t know who would believe that. Just last night I saw him on YouTube. You know YouTube? He was performing in Vegas and there were thousands of bearded and longhaired men in the audience, so it must have been a beard convention or something. I swear, sometimes I don’t believe how stupid Americans can be,” she said.	0
UPDATE: Hillary Clinton Leaves The Country As Mueller Indictment Is AnnouncedAnyone else think its weird that Hillary Clinton hopped on a jet and flew to the Ukraine last night?On Friday night, Clinton was seen with her husband Bill hopping aboard an aircraft to Lviv at the Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport.This announcement comes after speculation and rumors that one of the indictments handed down by Robert Muellers grand jury were for her.With recent news breaking that Clinton paid a Russian agency for information on Donald Trump, it is unsurprising that Mueller would target Clinton, nor is it really shocking that she would high-tail it out of the country just in case she is one of the people he is coming after on Monday.The interesting thing about the Ukraine is that the country has no extradition agreement with the United States, meaning that she can not be forced to return if indeed she is slated to be arrested Monday.This seems the likeliest scenario, former FBI agent Andrea Hawley told Fox News Saturday. Its worth noting that Hillary Clinton had no scheduled trips to the Ukraine or any reason to go there.Spokespeople for the Clintons have so far refused comment according to Fox and other news organizations.Read More: UPDATE: Hillary Clinton Leaves The Country As Mueller Indictment Is Announced | Morning Herald My Thoughts:IF THEY'RE THERE...WE CAN'T TOUCH THEM...

"Last night, a twitter account by the name of @solikearose tweeted out a surprising image of CNN broadcasting porn instead of Anthony Bourdain’s scheduled show Parts Unknown. And then without really much questioning, a bunch of news sites ran with it, claiming that the network showed the footage for about 30 minutes. Here are some screenshots grabbed by Mediaite.  It looks like the chaos all started when The Independent wrote up a story from this person’s tweets, which was then tweeted out by the Drudge Report. After that, it spread fast. Mashable, The New York Post, The Daily Mail, Esquire, and Variety have all published a story, and pretty much all of these articles are based on one or two tweets from @solikerose. Plus, many of the original stories didn’t include statements from CNN or RCN, the cable company that supposedly aired the porn.  Fact-checking largely didn’t begin until the stories were published. The @solikearose account has since turned private, and there don’t seem to be any reports of porn airing on CNN last night. RCN also released statements on twitter saying there is no evidence that porn was aired last night in Boston, where @solikearose is supposedly based. ""We are in the process of researching this incident but see no evidence our CNN network feed was compromised last evening in Boston,"" Jeff Carlson, SVP and general manager of RCN Boston, said in a statement to multiple outlets.  CNN has also released a statement: “The RCN cable operator in Boston aired inappropriate content for 30 minutes on CNN last night. CNN has asked for an explanation.” But that still doesn’t really verify that anything occurred.  @solikearose 800-746-4726. We have not had any reports of the programming issue you mentioned on CNN in Boston. If you're still having an — RCN (@RCNconnects) November 25, 2016  @solikearose issue with that channel, please DM us your address so we can troubleshoot when you're home. Thanks, Melissa — RCN (@RCNconnects) November 25, 2016  The appeal of the story is obvious: a network news may have aired porn for a full 30 minutes. Hilarious! And the CNN program that was supposed to be on was Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown. It’s a layup for body-part puns.  This is exactly how fake news spreads  But this is exactly how fake news spreads. Even if porn was aired on CNN, it’s clear that a lot of publications ran with a story based on tweets from one person before verifying the facts. Many of the headlines already implicate CNN, claiming the channel aired 30 minutes of porn without giving any context.  The stakes might not seem very high in this case, but fake news seems to have played a major role during the 2016 presidential campaign. Mistakes like this won’t be very funny when they cost us more than a laugh."	0
318 SHARES Share Tweet  President Trump is about to end the longstanding abuse of the American welfare system and ban migrants from getting free money and handouts for five years. The immigration rules will prohibit migrants from coming to the country and taking advantage of free American welfare money right away. It will slow down, or stop, chain migration while protecting American workers and potentially saving taxpayers money.What used to happen is that people would migrate to America and just live on the free money they received. That’s called welfare abuse. America is open to migrants, but perhaps we don’t want migrants who can’t fend for themselves. Maybe it’s better if people who are self-sufficient migrate to the country so that we can reduce the amount of citizens living off the system.President Trump wants to introduce a merit-based Green card system in which migrants compete for Visas. Migrants can earn points for themselves by learning to speak English, gaining job training or job offers, or doing something else that is considered a benefit to the America. The idea seems to be that in order for America to grant Visas or citizenship, the migrant has to give something back to the country. It’s as though the government wants to stop people coming to America and living off the system and would prefer people coming to the country to be contributors. Do something for America and America will do something for you.Migrants to those countries must compete for a limited number of visas by gaining points for English proficiency, competitive training, a job offer or another major achievement that benefits the host country.The concept, which is modeled after similar programs from Australia and Canada, is taking harsh criticism from activists. It’s like they want an open border policy where everyone gets free welfare money, but that would just be the downfall of America. If we observe what’s happening in Germany, with Merkel’s “come on in” policy, then we see a mass increase in horrible crimes like gang rape. Do we want mass amounts of migrant gang rape in America? There’s already enough trouble with crime in sanctuary cities that protect illegal immigrant criminals. Those folks should be deported because of their bad behavior and often violent crimes they commit on American people and even other immigrants.If America prevents immigrants from getting free benefits for five years, then that makes people think twice about coming here. If a family who thinks about crossing the border to start a new life knows that they cannot live for free, then they may not come at all. If they have possible jobs lined up and will be almost instantly integrating successfully with society, then that’s a great match. America is the land of the free, but not the land of the free money.Migrants who enter the United States cannot receive welfare during their first five years in the country, President Trump revealed from his upcoming immigration overhaul.“Just this week, we announced a historic immigration bill to create a merit-based Green Card system that ends the abuse of our welfare system, stops chain migration, and protects our workers and our economy,” he stated on his weekly radio address. “As an example, you cannot get welfare for five years when you come into our country.”“You cannot just come in like in past weeks, years, and decades, you come in immediately and start picking up welfare. For five years, you have to say you will not be asking or using our welfare systems.”Compare that to Germany, where Chancellor Angela Merkel opened the border to millions of unvetted migrants who can’t speak German and lack employable skills, which dooms them to perpetual welfare paid by German taxpayers – and boredom that manifests into terrorist attacks against, once again, German taxpayers.Last year the German government admitted that only 2.8% of over 1.2 million migrants had gotten a job – but even then those statistics might be exaggerated, according to	0
Max Pixel  Conspiracy theorists have sparked fears over an apocalyptic collision between Jupiter and Venus, set to plunge Earth into 15 days of darkness this month.  Just when you thought it couldn’t get darker or colder outside, the fear-mongering conspiracy theorists are here to tell you you’re wrong…  If you can suspend reality long enough to believe Jupiter and Venus will collide on Monday in an ‘astronomical’ space collision and subsequent global blackout, just because they said so in their falsified NASA statement.  ESO  According to the identity stealing so-called experts, writing on the website Dinos Mark as well as Reflection of Mind, the two brightest planets in our solar system will crash into each other and could even be visible from the naked eye.  The far-fetched claim continued:  According to the [NASA] report, Venus and Jupiter will engaged in a close parallelism, only being separated by one degree.  NASA  Now, to fan the flames of this fabricated fire, some clever cloggs has even gone as far as to publish a false statement.  The statement purported to be written by NASA official Charles Boden – who must be pretty angry right now – ‘confirmed’ the world would be plunged into darkness from November 15 and November 29.  NASA  The statement read:  NASA has confirmed that the Earth will experience 15 days of total darkness between November 15 and November 29, 2017. The event, according to NASA, hasn’t occurred in over 1 Million years. Astronomers from NASA have indicated that the world will remain in complete darkness starting on Sunday, November 15, 2017 at 3am, and will end on Monday, November 30, 2017 at 4:15 p.m. According to officials, the ‘November Black Out’ event will be caused by another astronomical event between Venus and Jupiter.

NASA has denied it will happen time and time again, stating in over one million years, an event like this has never occurred.  The overactive imaginations of conspiracy theorists must be commended, but perhaps next time, put it into a work of science fiction rather than try and pass it off as a NASA-confirmed fact.  Craig Hamilton-Parker / Youtube  Meanwhile, on the Internet, other theorists are gearing up for their psychic predictions for 2018, like Craig Hamilton-Parker, the self-proclaimed modern day Nostradamus.  A self-proclaimed prophet, who wants to seemingly shatter your dreams, hopes and aspirations for next year with his special potion of unproven alarm and fear-mongering mysticism.  Hamilton-Parker, who shares all his best work on YouTube and psychics.com from his home in Southampton, foresees a US attack on North Korea, a chemical attack on a European city and an attempt to impeach Trump.  Getty  He doesn’t reveal his sources, but it seems he’s really keeping up with current affairs in his mission to pull predictions out of his backside.  For 2018 he’s bookmarked in his calendar the following world crises: US forces striking North Korea by blowing up a key trade route, Kim Jong-un being overthrown by his own people, a failed attempt to impeach Donald Trump and the sinking of a US warship.  Getty  The good news is there’s absolutely no proof this guy has any more insight into what’s going to happen to the global political and social climate in 2018, than he does into what I’m going to have for my dinner.  Considering my fridge is empty, my stomach’s growling and I make erratic supermarket decisions when I’m hungry, I’d like to see him try.	0
UPDATE: Consistent with our subsequent coverage of the California wildfires, this story has been updated to clarify that Jesus Fabian Gonzales is not suspected of the recent Sonoma County fires that killed 40 residents.  The U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) issued a detainer request on the Sonoma County Jail for Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, who was arrested Sunday on suspicion of arson in Wine Country fires.  Breitbart News reported earlier this week that Sonoma County Sheriffs had arrested Jesus Fabian Gonzalez, 29, at Maxwell Regional Park in Sonoma County after a series of reports of ongoing fires in the region. Mr. Gonzalez was observed around 3:00 p.m. PDT wearing a jacket and walking “out of the creek area and a plume of smoke behind him,” according to the Santa Rosa Press Democrat.  Mr. Gonzalez, who is homeless and reportedly known by law enforcement to have been living under a nearby bridge, claimed he was cold and had lit the fire to stay warm. But it was a balmy 78 degrees when he and the plume of smoke were first observed.  Mr. Gonzalez was booked into the Sonoma County Jail for suspicion of felony arson. His bail was set at a steep $110,000, according to the Sonoma County Sheriff Public Information Officer.  Sargent Spencer Crum told Breitbart that Mr. Gonzalez is also on a U.S. Immigration & Customs Enforcement Agency (ICE) detainer request, despite Sonoma County declaring itself as a “sanctuary county” in May 2014. The county only cooperates with “ICE holds” if the prisoner has been convicted of a felony or any misdemeanor offence that falls within the Trust Act within the last five years. Mr. Gonzalez’s immigration status has not yet been announced.  The American Civil Liberties Union argues detainers are a violation of “unreasonable searches and seizures” under the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment.  The Sonoma County Sheriff Department’s “1.0 Policy Statement” reads: “No person shall be held solely on the basis of their immigration status.” The policy adds that “the immigration status of a person, and the lack of immigration documentation, should have no bearing on the manner in which Sheriff’s Office personnel execute their duties.”  According to ICE documents, Sonoma County declined 491 detainer requests in 2014 and 2015. During the 2017 period from January 28 through February 3, when President Donald Trump issued his immigration Executive Order 13768 to require all federal, state and local government to comply with ICE detainers, Sonoma County still denied detainers.  Sonoma County fires have killed dozens. 172 are still missing and 102,000 residents have been dislocated — about one-fifth of the entire population. The latest financial losses include 3,819 unincorporated parcels with 100 structures valued at $2,016,962,239, and 2,907 homes and 86 commercial units lost in the city of Santa Rosa valued at $1.18 billion.	0
MR. WILLIAMS: Senator Clinton, we're here in Ohio. Senator Obama is here. This is the debate. You would agree the difference in tone over just those 48 hours was striking.  SEN. CLINTON: Well, this is a contested campaign. And as I have said many times, I have a great deal of respect for Senator Obama, but we have differences. And in the last several days, some of those differences in tactics and the choices that Senator Obama's campaign has made regarding flyers and mailers and other information that has been put out about my health care plan and my position on NAFTA have been very disturbing to me.  And therefore, I think it's important that you stand up for yourself and you point out these differences so that voters can have the information they need to make a decision.  You know, for example, it's been unfortunate that Senator Obama has consistently said that I would force people to have health care whether they could afford it or not. You know, health care reform and achieving universal health care is a passion of mine. It is something I believe in with all my heart. And every day that I'm campaigning, and certainly here throughout Ohio, I've met so many families -- happened again this morning in Lorain -- who are just devastated because they don't get the health care they deserve to have. And unfortunately it's a debate we should have that is accurate and is based in facts about my plan and Senator Obama's plan, because my plan will cover everyone and it will be affordable. And on many occasions, independent experts have concluded exactly that.  And Senator Obama's plan does not cover everyone. It would leave, give or take, 15 million people out. So we should have a good debate that uses accurate information, not false, misleading, and discredited information, especially on something as important as whether or not we will achieve quality, affordable health care for everyone. That's my goal. That's what I'm fighting for, and I'm going to stand up for that.  MR. WILLIAMS: On the topic of accurate information, and to that end, one of the things that has happened over the past 36 hours -- a photo went out the website The Drudge Report, showing Senator Obama in the native garb of a nation he was visiting, as you have done in a host country on a trip overseas.  Matt Drudge on his website said it came from a source inside the Clinton campaign. Can you say unequivocally here tonight it did not?  Advertisement Continue reading the main story  SEN. CLINTON: Well, so far as I know, it did not. And I certainly know nothing about it and have made clear that that's not the kind of behavior that I condone or expect from the people working in my campaign. But we have no evidence where it came from.  So I think that it's clear what I would do if it were someone in my campaign, as I have in the past: asking people to leave my campaign if they do things that I disagree with.  MR. WILLIAMS: Senator Obama, your response.  SEN. OBAMA: Well, first of all, I take Senator Clinton at her word that she knew nothing about the photo. So I think that's something that we can set aside.  I do want to focus on the issue of health care because Senator Clinton has suggested that the flyer that we put out, the mailing that we put out, was inaccurate. Now, keep in mind that I have consistently said that Senator Clinton's got a good health care plan. I think I have a good health care plan. I think mine is better, but I have said that 95 percent of our health care plan is similar.  I have endured over the course of this campaign repeatedly negative mailing from Senator Clinton in Iowa, in Nevada and other places suggesting that I want to leave 15 million people out.  According to Senator Clinton, that is accurate. I dispute it, and I think it is inaccurate. On the other hand, I don't fault Senator Clinton for wanting to point out what she thinks is an advantage to her plan.  The reason she thinks that there are more people covered under her plan than mine is 	1
President Donald Trump has finally given Congress the authorization to pursue charges against Hillary Clinton.  Jason Chaffetz, the Chairman of the United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, informed the committee that he had a meeting with President Trump who gave him permission to investigate whatever he wants. Chaffetz also hinted that charges against Hillary could be happening soon.  Here is what Chaffetz said:  “President Trump visited Philadelphia when we were at our planning and strategy session. I went backstage with the President. Here’s what he said: ‘You do a great job. Listen, I understand I’m the president and you have a job. You do the oversight. Don’t slow down. Go after everything you want to go after. You look at everything you want to look at.’ If you sat there and heard what he said to me about pursuing oversight and government, you would be inspired. And for him to convey a message of ‘don’t slow down,’ I think was a good message.”  WATCH:  The news that President Trump supports the investigation comes just days after the Oversight Committee ordered James Comey, (now former) FBI Director, to release the contents of Hillary Clinton’s email server. This means that the lawless and reckless behavior of Hillary Clinton hasn’t yet escaped from a full-blown investigation.  Without Obama and Comey to cover her back now, Hillary Clinton may finally be indicted. It’s about time she is held responsible for her countless crimes and for betraying our country. She has to answer for that, and now that President Trump is in control, she won’t make it out of this investigation so easily.  What do you think about this?

Read original article here  Liberals sure are afraid of Roy Moore. Not only did they push a woman in front of the cameras to cry and lie about some stuff that allegedly happened 35 years ago she’s just now remembering to mention (we refuse to repeat the salacious allegations because they are 100% verifiable fake news) but when the fake 14-year-old didn’t work for them, the Democrat Party did something even worse: they doubled down on the story, introduced a new actress, and had her tell an even more horrible lie.    Fiona Dourif says she was 11 years old when Moore “groped her in the alley behind the” church they both attended in 1957. “It was the most horrifying moment of my life,” she told MSNBC’s Rachel Maddow on Friday night. She then described the series of events that allegedly happened, including the obviously false allegation that he baited her into the alley with candy. “Roy Moore definitely did all of those things and more,” she said looking into the camera, dry-eyed.    Maddow then interviewed Dourif’s parents, who said that they knew of the alleged abuse but didn’t say anything until he was running for Senator because they “feared for their lives.” Of course, if that was the case they would not have waited until he had more political power and wealth than he did when this allegedly happened.    One piece of information Dourif failed to mention is that she is currently employed as a housekeeper for Michelle Obama at the D.C. mansion “she” and her “husband” Barack share. This information was uncovered by Gateway Pundit’s Charles C. Johnson, who notes in his report that “Dourif is paid extremely well according to public documents, which report a $250,783.33 annual salary for Dourif.”    “Why would Barack and Michelle Obama’s housekeeper suddenly remember that she was molested by someone who is running for public office – someone of the opposing party,” Johnson writes. “This stinks more than Malia Obama’s dorm room after one of her reefer parties.”    What exactly is going on? Ever since it her employer was revealed, Dourif has gone dark, removing all of her social media presences and refusing to respond to interview requests from any source.	0

In the Senate, the bill is assigned to another committee and, if released, debated and voted on. Again, a simple majority (51 of 100) passes the bill. Finally, a conference committee made of House and Senate members works out any differences between the House and Senate versions of the bill. The resulting bill returns to the House and Senate for final approval. The Government Printing Office prints the revised bill in a process called enrolling. The President has 10 days to sign or veto the enrolled bill."	0
WASHINGTON – U.S. Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, today spoke on the Senate floor in support of religious freedom. Flake invoked the nomination of Professor Amy Barrett, whose nomination to the federal bench has grown contentious due to insinuations on the part of Democrats and special-interest groups that her Catholic faith would affect her ability to be a judge.      “It is no better for Democrats to evaluate a judicial nominee based on how many books are in the Bible on which she swears her oath, than it is for Republicans to judge a congressman for the Quran on which he does the same. To suggest that somehow a Roman Catholic judge would disregard the Constitution in favor of Church doctrine—when she has emphatically and repeatedly said she would not—is as wrong as suggesting that a Muslim judge would be somehow be forced to follow sharia law over the Constitution. Religious liberty must not depend on the religion in question.”    When Barrett’s religion came up in her confirmation hearing, Flake was quick to argue that line of questioning was both inappropriate and bordered on a religious test.

Barrett was confirmed by a vote of 55-43.  To view Flake’s speech, click here.  A transcript of the prepared remarks can be viewed below.

In particular, I would like to continue to urge this body to respect our Constitutional values and avoid any hint of applying religious tests to those who heed the call of government service.  Freedom of religion is as foundational a principle as we have in this country, yet some in this chamber want to take a cabined view of it: If you’re a judicial nominee, it’s fine to attend the occasional worship service, but don’t let on that you take it too seriously.  That is unacceptable.  From the inception of our republic, religious believers have chosen to serve their country in countless ways. Whether through the armed forces, holding elected office, or sitting on the courts, Americans of faith have always answered the call. We should welcome this service. And we should not sit idly by while others question the propriety of their service by suggesting a de facto religious test. The Framers of the Constitution were fearful of this very thinking.  They understood the importance of religious participation and foresaw the benefits religious believers of all backgrounds would contribute to the common good. They also knew from centuries of war and suffering in Europe the high costs of religious intolerance. That’s why they made it clear in Article VI of the Constitution that no public officers could be subject to a “religious test.” This edict is entirely unambiguous in its language and intent. This country is to be served by people of all faiths, committed to the Constitution and the common good.  It is up to us to question the qualifications and jurisprudence of nominees, not their religious views. Unfortunately, that is not what is happening to Professor Barrett.  I was at her confirmation hearing, where she faced inappropriate questions and objections based on her religious views. I witnessed a citizen heeding the call to serve her country, face inquiries into her religious beliefs that bordered on ridicule. My friends on the other side of the aisle defend their questions and their conduct, and I don’t doubt their sincerity. But there is little comfort in the defense that it doesn’t matter that Professor Barrett is a Catholic--but somehow it matters what sort of Catholic Professor Barrett is. These are unconstitutional distinctions without	1
President Donald Trump and U.S. Congress voted yesterday on a bill that could change the world. Child support claims have said to come to an end and many officials are not happy about it.  President Trump claims he will no longer for any party of parent to pay child support. Trump also says that ant reports of abuse or negligence to a child from either party will result in the child automatically being turned over to the State Child Welfare.

"10 things to know about McCain  For all the coverage this week of Senator John McCain's background, there are some important things you won't learn about him from the TV networks. His carefully crafted positive image relies on people not knowing this stuff—and you might be surprised by some of it.  Please check out the list below, and then forward it to your friends, family, and coworkers. We can't rely on the media to tell folks about the real John McCain—but if we all pass this along, we can reach as many people as CNN Headline News does on a good night.  Click here to tell us how many people you can pass it on to—and to see our progress nationally:  http://pol.moveon.org/mccain10/  10 things you should know about John McCain (but probably don't):  John McCain voted against establishing a national holiday in honor of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Now he says his position has ""evolved,"" yet he's continued to oppose key civil rights laws.1 According to Bloomberg News, McCain is more hawkish than Bush on Iraq, Russia and China. Conservative columnist Pat Buchanan says McCain ""will make Cheney look like Gandhi.""2 His reputation is built on his opposition to torture, but McCain voted against a bill to ban waterboarding, and then applauded President Bush for vetoing that ban.3  McCain opposes a woman's right to choose. He said, ""I do not support Roe versus Wade. It should be overturned.""4 The Children's Defense Fund rated McCain as the worst senator in Congress for children. He voted against the children's health care bill last year, then defended Bush's veto of the bill.5 He's one of the richest people in a Senate filled with millionaires. The Associated Press reports he and his wife own at least eight homes! Yet McCain says the solution to the housing crisis is for people facing foreclosure to get a ""second job"" and skip their vacations.6 Many of McCain's fellow Republican senators say he's too reckless to be commander in chief. One Republican senator said: ""The thought of his being president sends a cold chill down my spine. He's erratic. He's hotheaded. He loses his temper and he worries me.""7 McCain talks a lot about taking on special interests, but his campaign manager and top advisers are actually lobbyists. The government watchdog group Public Citizen says McCain has 59 lobbyists raising money for his campaign, more than any of the other presidential candidates.8 McCain has sought closer ties to the extreme religious right in recent years. The pastor McCain calls his ""spiritual guide,"" Rod Parsley, believes America's founding mission is to destroy Islam, which he calls a ""false religion."" McCain sought the political support of right-wing preacher John Hagee, who believes Hurricane Katrina was God's punishment for gay rights and called the Catholic Church ""the Antichrist"" and a ""false cult.""9 He positions himself as pro-environment, but he scored a 0—yes, zero—from the League of Conservation Voters last year.10  John McCain is not who the Washington press corps make him out to be.

On March 24, 2018, one month and ten days after the February 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida, student-led pro-gun control “March For Our Lives” demonstrations took place across America, including in Washington, D.C.  The word “Our” in March For Our Lives refers to students.  From Wikipedia:  March For Our Lives was a student-led demonstration in support of tighter gun control that took place on March 24, 2018, in Washington, D.C., with over 800 sibling events throughout the United States and around the world. Student organizers from Never Again MSD planned the march in collaboration with the nonprofit organization Everytown for Gun Safety. The event followed the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, which was described by many media outlets as a possible tipping point for gun control legislation.  Never Again MSD (MSD refers to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School) is a group started on social media as a movement “For survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting, by survivors of the Stoneman Douglas Shooting” using the hashtag #NeverAgain.  The MSD student survivors who formed Never Again MSD include the now-famous David Hogg, Emma Gonzalez, and Cameron Kasky.  Public demonstrations, especially those that are large-scale like March For Our Lives, require a permit from the police department of the city in which the demonstration will take place.  European political researcher Ole Dammegard contacted the Metropolitan D. C. Police Department concerning the permit for the March For Our Lives demonstration in Washington, D.C.  Dammegard received this email from Officer Scott C. Earhardt of the Homeland Security Bureau of the Metropolitan Police Department:  Good morning, In reference to your inquiry concerning the March For Our Lives Demonstration, here in the District of Columbia on March 24, 2018. MPD received a permit application several months prior to the actual event, and there was several months of planning for this large event. If your are requesting additional information reference this event, please follow the below steps to file your Freedom of Information Act request: https://foia-dc.gov/App/Index.aspx If your have any additional question sor concerns, please feel free in contacting me directly. Officer Scott C. Earhardt, Badge No. 2372 Homeland Security Bureau  Special Operations Division  Planning and Logistics  Metropolitan Police Department  2850 New York Ave., N.E.  Washington, D.C. 20002  202-671-6529 (Office)  202-671-6522 (Planning)  202-671-6511 (Station) Scott.Earhardt@dc.gov  Below is a screenshot of the email (source: Professor James Fetzer):  According to the PDF document, Metropolitan Police Department, Washington.D.C., Scott Earhardt indeed is a detective there. Here’s a screenshot I took from page 6 of the 65-page document:  Here are some facts:  The shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas (MSD) High School occurred on February 14, 2018. A day after the shooting, on February 15, 2018, MSD students formed the group, Never Again MSD. On March 24, 2018, March For Our Lives demonstrations took place in Washington, D.C. (and other cities). Among the organizers of March For Our Lives is Never Again MSD , which had not existed before February 15 . The D.C. Metropolitan Police Department received a permit application for March For Our Lives demonstration “ several months prior to the actual event”.  Questions:  How can Never Again MSD apply for a permit “several months” BEFORE the group had even been formed? How can an application be made for a permit for a “March For Our Lives” demonstration “several months” BEFORE the Parkland MSD school shooting that galvanized MSD students to form the Never Again MSD group that organized the demonstration?

Bill O’Reilly was reportedly minding his own business at a bagel shop in New York City this morning when he was approached by two women and three men who said they were “disgusted” by his behavior towards women at Fox News. O’Reilly, who has never been afraid of anyone, turned and told the group to grow up and leave him alone. That’s when the “tolerant” liberals got violent.  One of the men grabbed O’Reilly and dragged him out into the street, according to witnesses, where the other two men proceeded to kick him until he was unconscious and bleeding. The 5 perpetrators, who are still at large, ran off like the cowards they are. The police arrived within minutes and called for medical help.  O’Reilly was taken to St. Vincent’s where he is in critical condition with 4 broken ribs and a punctured lung. Doctors also fear that he had a cardiac event and have him on a monitor. They are hopeful, but with O’Reilly’s age and the extent of his injuries, he may not make it through.  The family is asking for privacy at this difficult time and police are asking for anyone with cell phone pictures or videos of the incident to contact them. So far nobody has come forward other than more New York liberals who say O’Reilly “got what he deserved” for allegedly harassing women in the workplace.  Liberals are always talking about cruel and unusual punishment. They don’t want murderers to be executed or terrorists to be “tortured,” but it’s perfectly acceptable for a man to be beaten within an inch of his life for something nobody has proven he’s done.  Liberalism is truly a mental disorder.	0

"Year 2017 does not seem to be going well for the United States of America. Sources have said that US President Donald Trump will soon issue an executive order to ban Facebook in the country.  On the other hand, even some Republican leaders said that they were opposed to the idea of Facebook — an American corporation — being banned in the country.  Unfazed by the criticism from his own party members, Trump said that this move would fight fake news being circulated on social media websites. ""Inside, we both know what's been going on. We know the game and we're gonna play it,"" said Trump.  Governance involves taking difficult steps, said the US president, adding that despite Facebook taking action against fake news, a lot of false stories and 'alternative facts' were still being circulated on the site.  Other social websites like Twitter and Instagram, though, will be excluded from the executive order.  The people working for Facebook are not happy about this selective exclusion.  Rick Rowlinson, a source from Facebook, said that even if the ban on Facebook was actually meant to fight against fake news, the President's ""commitment"" should have not just been limited to Facebook. ""You know the rules and so do I. A full commitment's what I'm thinking of,"" Rowlinson said. ""You wouldn't get this from any other guy,"" he added, shaking his head.  In California, where Facebook is based, a large section of people have already begun protesting against this move.  Courts in the US had earlier blocked Trump's travel ban executive order.  Keen on supporting the President, Vice President Mike Pence has also said that he will support the executive order if it is passed by Trump.  Reacting to this proposed order, Facebook co-founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said that Facebook will continue to run its operations from California even if the site is banned in the US.  On Trump's claim to fight fake news, Zuckerberg said that an outright ban was not the correct way to fight false news.  Last month, reports were saying that a court in Pakistan was mulling action against Facebook over 'blasphemous content'.  Lately, there have been some countries speaking out against social media websites. If Trump's executive order is passed, US will join the list of those countries.  Employees of Facebook are planning to start a signature campaign against the order if it gets passed.  Donald Trump's remarks on Facebook and Zuckerberg's response has gone viral.

The city of Houston has already seen enough tragedy due to the catastrophic flooding from Hurricane Harvey, and unfortunately things took a turn for the worst today when a U.S. Navy ship collided with a building in the downtown area.  The ship was eventually identified as an Arleigh Burke-class destroyer belonging to the Navy’s 7th fleet.  It is unclear why this ship was over 20 miles inland and trying to navigate through a major metropolitan area or was not able to see the building and take evasive action.  “I had climbed up on my roof due to dem risin’ flood waters, when I saw a big ship sailin’ down the street. I says to myself ‘Oh Lawdy, someone’s done come to rescue us!’ and then it sails right past my house and smack straight into that yonder building,” said Georgia Brown, a resident who witnessed the incident.  Following incidents involving the USS Fitzgerald, USS John S. McCain, and the USS Ted Kennedy, this marks the fifth collision incident this summer for destroyers from the Navy’s besieged 7th fleet.  Even though the Navy declined to comment on the cause of the collision due to an ongoing investigation, it did say that the captain had been relieved of his command.  A senior defense official theorized that the ship had likely veered off course from its patrol route in the South China Sea, despite reserve from the Navy.  Navy officials have stated that they are planning a number of PowerPoint trainings related to urban maritime navigation.	0
Instead of a long and drawn-out legal battle, the men at the center of the Philadelphia Starbucks arrest incident have taken an incredibly low settlement from the city with a perk that speaks to their interests. Taking $1 dollar settlements each, Rashon Nelson and Donte Robinson will help spearhead a $200,000 grant program designed to aid young entrepreneurs like themselves.  NBC News reports:  The two black men whose arrest at a Philadelphia Starbucks last month set off a wave of protests against the coffee giant for discrimination have reached a settlement with the city, the mayor’s office said Wednesday.  They will each be paid $1.  In addition, Donte Robinson and Rashon Nelson, both 23, will release the city and employees of all claims in exchange for the creation of a $200,000 fund that, through the help of a nonprofit organization, will assist young entrepreneurs in Philadelphia.  Robinson and Nelson will also serve on a committee to establish and award the grants, which will focus on starting a pilot curriculum for public high school students to attain the skills to become business owners.  Good for Nelson, Robinson, and the city of Philadelphia in turning this into a positive moment.  —  Photo: Getty  Related  Also On The Rickey Smiley Morning Show:	0
James Fields, from Ohio, arrested following attack at ‘Unite the Right’ gathering, and two police officers die in helicopter crash  This article is more than 2 years old  This article is more than 2 years old  A man has been arrested and charged with murder after a car rammed into a group of people peacefully protesting against a white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, killing one person and injuring 19.  Police said a 32-year-old woman had died and that they were attempting to notify her family before releasing more details.  Col Martin Kumer, the superintendent of Albemarle-Charlottesville regional jail, told the Guardian that 20-year-old James Fields, of Ohio, had been arrested following the attack on Saturday.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest James Fields was charged with second-degree murder. Photograph: Albemarle County Jail/AFP/Getty Images  “He has been charged with second degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and failing to stop at an accident that resulted in a death,” Kumer said in an email.  Donald Trump condemned the “violence on many sides”, but faced criticism for failing to directly denounce the far-right demonstrators.  In a separate incident, two police officers died when their helicopter, which was monitoring the far-right rally, crashed outside Charlottesville.  State police said in a statement the helicopter was “assisting public safety resources with the ongoing situation” when it crashed in a wooded area. The pilot, Lieutenant H Jay Cullen, 48, of Midlothian, Virginia, and Trooper-pilot Berke Bates of Quinton, Virginia, died at the scene.  The deaths came at the end of a day marked by violent clashes between far-right nationalists and people who had come to protest against their occupation of a downtown park containing a statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee.  Witnesses said those hit by the car were peacefully protesting against the white supremacist rally and footage showed the vehicle crashing into another car, throwing people over the top of it.  Play Video 1:34 Virginia governor says 'go home' to white supremacists and nazis – video  Charlottesville: far-right crowd with torches encircles counter-protest group Read more  The photographer Pat Jarrett, who witnessed the incident, said: “A gray Dodge Charger plowed into a sedan and then into a minivan. Bodies flew. People were terrified and screaming. Those closest to it said it was definitely a violent attack. The driver, who people later described as a skinny white guy with a straggly beard, reversed out of there and drove off, the front end of his car all smashed up.”  Charlottesville mayor Mike Signer tweeted: “I am heartbroken that a life has been lost here. I urge all people of good will – go home.”  Speaking at a press conference on Saturday evening, the governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, who had earlier declared a state of emergency, told the white supremacists: “Go home … Shame on you. You pretend you are patriots, but you are anything but a patriot.”  The mother of Fields told the Associated Press on Saturday night that she knew her son was attending a rally in Virginia but didn’t know it was a white supremacist rally.  “I thought it had something to do with Trump. Trump’s not a white supremacist,” Samantha Bloom said, before becoming visibly upset as she learned of the injuries and deaths at the rally “He had an African-American friend …,” she said before her voice trailed off.  Responding to the events in Charlottesville from Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump: “We condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides.”  But the Republican senator Marco Rubio tweeted that it was important for Trump to describe the events as a “terror attack by white supremacists”.  The FBI said it was opening a civil rights investigation into the accident along with the justice department’s civil rights division and the district attorney’s office.  The US atto	0
A ship owned and operated by the Clinton Foundation was raided as it arrived from Africa this morning at the Port of Baltimore. The ship, which was supposed to be carrying “emergency supplies,” was actually carrying a cargo that had authorities stunned. BPA Harbormaster Jake Cummings explained to CNN:  “We received a tip that the Clinton Foundation flagship, The Chelsea, was carrying illegal contraband into the United States. We honestly didn’t know what to expect, but what we found was simply…surreal. In the middle of the ship’s large manifest of containers, most of which were empty, we found 14 containing…people. Yes, people. They were all Refugees from places like Yemen and Syria and not a single one had any kind of documentation. We interviewed those who spoke English and were told that for $40K, anyone can catch a ride to the United States on a ship nobody would ever suspect.”  Immigration was immediately called and found that of the 460 people on board illegally, not one had been through any kind of vetting process. After running the men through facial recognition, they found more than a dozen suspected terrorists who are on the US no-fly list. Those men were about to be unleashed on the public for $40K each.	0
The federal government grants some businesses the ability to pay reduced or no taxes because they are set up as a “non-profit.” The NFL is one of those businesses – or was, until Sunday evening when Donald Trump quietly signed an executive order removing the sports league’s non-profit status.  The order notes the un-American attitude displayed by the players, who repeatedly kneel during the National Anthem, burn flags in their locker rooms, and disrespect our country in every way imaginable.  To date, little has been done to stop players from disrespecting our military, our flag, and all they stand for, so President Trump “temporarily” revoked their 401(c)(3) status “until it is clear that players and team owners respect their country.”  The NFL will be classified as a for-profit entity for tax purposes for the 2017 fiscal year, but the order allows the league to re-apply for tax-exempt status in January 2018 “if all of the problems are solved.”  The White House spokeswoman told Breitbart News that the President hopes to see all the “athletes protesting our police and our flag or otherwise using their positions to spread hate” fired and replaced with people who “love and respect America.”  The NFL has thus far refused comment.	0
The resistance against Trump must continue…these aren’t just small ideological differences being played out, or debates where both sides should be calmly and distantly considered. To the contrary, the very foundation and basis of the country we call our own is at stake! That is why this viral guide to getting involved with the opposition is so important…if you haven’t read it yet, you should absolutely do so now!  And things continue to look dire, and it goes even beyond Trump: GOP Rep Rob McCaskill (R-Texas) Twitter feed, much like the Orange one in the Oval Office, is a huge basket full of crazy. He tweets with glee about global warming “hoaxes.” He tweets that Americans should boycott Nordstrom for removing Ivanka’s merchandise (they were, that’s why they pulled the line).  The worst tweet from McCaskill, though, was one from Friday, where he very literally wished for another 9/11 just to prove judges wrong. That’s right, he tweeted “Can’t wait for the next 9/11 so the 9th District circuit ruling judges will wish they didn’t roll over for enemies wishing death on America #MuslimBan.”  Um, seem scary to you? With tweets saying the judges would be responsible for a terrorist attack, the administration is laying the groundwork for a deeper police state or for something we’ve never had in this country, martial law. Trump is a dictator. While McCaskill may not be smart enough to be in on the plan, he’s certainly complicit and he’s demonstrating what nearly all Republicans are guilty of. He doesn’t care about the American people. He only cares about his party.  This is terrifying, and there’s never been a more important time to stand up to fight and defend your country. If you are ready to join the opposition but aren’t quite sure how to get involved, take this grassroots call to action today!	0
USDA approves slaughterhouses producing horse meat for human consumption  You might have to train your taste buds to get used to horse meat soon, because FYI: The U.S. government just approved the operation of horse meat slaughterhouses to produce meat for human consumption.  New Mexico, Missouri and Iowa are just some of the areas where horse meat plants are expected to be approved by the USDA. While horse meat, technically, can’t be legally sold in the United States for human consumption, it may still turn up in the US food supply because it can be sold to Mexico, then re-labeled and shipped back to the USA as a low-cost meat filler. This has already been documented occurring in Europe, where meatballs sold in European grocery stores were found to be made with horse meat.  Where do these horses come from?  While horse meat slaughterhouses were banned during the Bush Administration, the ban expired in 2011 under President Obama’s watch, thereby allowing horse meat slaughterhouses to restart operations.  Reuters claims that around 130,000 horses are slaughtered each year in Canada and Mexico — and it seems the United States wants a huge chunk of that business, as well.  Not-so-fun fact: Most horse meat come from horse owners who decide to have their horses killed for a variety of reasons, such as illness, injury, or simply because they cannot afford to keep their horses fed and cared for anymore.  Many of these owners sell their horses to slaughterhouses for an incredibly low amount. Yep, you read that right: They allow strangers to haul their horses away to a meat packing plant, only to be slaughtered mercilessly around several other screaming horses.  Do keep all this in mind the next time you consider buying a horse for your family. Raising one requires a tremendous amount of effort, so be a responsible horse owner. Don’t let your pet get slaughtered once you get tired of it — because if you do, it might eventually end up on your plate the next time you purchase some meatballs for your spaghetti.

"""I became a Republican sooner in my life than"" Ronald Reagan did in his.  On his Aug. 30 radio program, conservative commentator Sean Hannity noted that Texas Gov. Rick Perry’s years-ago switch from the Democratic to the Republican party Puts him in the same company as the nation’s 40th president.  ""You’re sort of like Ronald Reagan, you feel the Democratic Party left you?"" Hannity asked.  Perry replied that he’d had a conversation with Reagan’s son Michael, a political consultant and former radio host. ""I told Michael Reagan the other day … ‘You know, I love your dad, and he was part of the reason I became a Republican,’ but I said, ‘I became a Republican sooner in my life than your dad did.’ ""  Perry and Hannity shared a laugh over that. But that light moment left unresolved how old each leader was when he made his D-to-R leap. Did Perry beat Reagan to the flip point?  We’ll take a look at Reagan first. In March 2010, PolitiFact Florida rated True the claim that ""Reagan was a Democrat before he was a Republican.""  Historian Edward Yager, author of the 2006 biography Ronald Reagan’s Journey: Democrat to Republican, told PolitiFact Florida that Reagan, who was born Feb. 6, 1911, ""was registered Democrat from the time that he voted for (Democrat Franklin Roosevelt) in 1932, when he was 21.""  Yager said that he hadn’t seen copies of Reagan’s voter registration cards but that ""virtually all the sources that refer to"" Reagan’s party affiliation indicate that he was registered as a Democrat. Yager also noted that Reagan ""has two autobiographies in which he refers to his voting for (Roosevelt) four times"" and then for President Harry Truman, a Democrat, in 1948.  Later, while still a Democrat, Reagan began supporting Republican presidential candidates. Melissa Giller, director of communications and programs at Reagan’s presidential library, told PolitiFact Florida that Reagan endorsed the presidential candidacies of Republican Dwight Eisenhower in 1952 and 1956 — at ages 41 and 45, respectively — and Republican Richard Nixon in 1960 ""while remaining a Democrat.""  Perry and other Republican presidential candidates are scheduled to debate at the Reagan library, in Simi Valley, Calif., on Sept. 7.  The library’s website says Reagan registered as a Republican in the fall of 1962, when he was 51. According to the site, a woman interrupted Reagan while he was speaking in favor of Nixon’s unsuccessful gubernatorial bid in California to ask him whether he had yet to register as a Republican. ""When he said, ‘Well, no, I haven’t yet, but I intend to,’ down the center aisle through the audience came a woman who declared, ‘I’m a registrar,’ and placed a registration card in front of him,"" the site says. ""In front of his audience, Ronald Reagan officially joined the Republican Party.""  In her 2010 email to PolitiFact Florida, Giller pointed to the famous Reagan quip that Hannity echoed on his show: ""I didn't leave the Democratic Party. The party left me.''  Other studies of Reagan also trace his party switch to 1962, including Yager’s book and a 1982 Reagan biography by Lou Cannon, which says Reagan ""was an active Democrat"" in 1952, when he married Nancy Davis, ""and would remain a registered Democrat for another decade.""  In 1962, Cannon writes, when Reagan was approached by California Republicans to help campaign on their behalf, he told them that he ""didn’t want to be a professional Democrat campaigning for the Republicans"" and would re-register as a Republican. ""He did so, at a subsequent political meeting where he spoke on behalf of the ill-fated Nixon campaign against Governor Edmund G. (Pat) Brown,"" Cannon writes.  So, by several accounts, Reagan was 51 when he became a Republican, although he began backing GOP presidential candidates a decade earlier.  How old was Perry, born March 4, 1950, when he made his move?  We’ve looked at Perry’s political past in previous fact-checks, reporting that Perry won his first election as a Democrat, tak"	1
"Western countries are being urged to intervene in a case where 6 young school girls facing execution for acting indecently at a friends house.  Fathima Al Kwaini and her friends that included three male friends have celebrated  Kwaini's  birthday at a friends house. A neighbor supposedly an assistant of an Imam of a mosque close by has reported this to Saudi Arabia's religious police. When the police arrived the girls were dancing with their male friends and they were arrested immediately.          The ultra conservative Arabian nation that has one of the worst human rights records is also a member of the United Nations Human Rights commission and recently got elected to the Women's Rights Commission as well which sparked anger and protest.  According to HRW the girls were detained for more than a year before the trial and never confessed committing any crime. However the verdict of the ""male only"" Sharia panel was that they need o be executed in accordance with the Sharia law. The boys were only advised ""not to be victimized"" the report further states.      Saudi uses methods such as beheading, stoning and crucifixion to execute women for crimes, including adultery, in the strict Islamic country. Beheadings take place in public squares where the headless corpses are later put on display."	0
