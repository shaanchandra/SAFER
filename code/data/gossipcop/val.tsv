"Sofia Vergara and Joe Manganiello would like to make something very clear:  Not only do they comprise a great looking couple, but they are doing just great as a couple as well.  Thanks for not even bothering to ask!  The latest issue of Star Magazine alleges that the Modern Family star was ""caught cheating in Rome"" and has been spotted on numerous occasions without her wedding ring on.  The cover also screams, in all capital letters, that the marriage between Vergera and Manganiello is ""OVER!""  Is it really, though?  In an angry Instagram post, Vergara blasted these infidelity claims, stating that the tabloid Photoshopped the image in which it detailed how her finger was lacking a ring.  ""The editor of this magazine is an idiot,"" the actress wrote simply, going on and on as follows:  ""If he is going to have my ring removed to create fake 'news,' he should have made sure that he removed from social media all the other pictures of that award night in Rome where I'm wearing it.  ""By the way, that's my friend, the producer of the movie Bent, that I was shooting in Rome and who came to spend Easter at my home the week later.  ""#Starmagazinebullies #goinventsh*itaboutyourmother.""  Wait... a supermarket tabloid twisted a harmless photograph to make it appear scandalous?  It used Photoshop? It flat-out lied?  Wow. Tell us more.  And that's exactly what Manganiello himself has done.  The former True Blood star has issued his own spirited post on Instagram, slamming this same cover story and expressing love for his wife.  ""Big surprise everyone but Star created a fake story and then photo shopped my wife's engagement ring off of her finger in order to sell magazines,"" he wrote.  ""They are run by malicious trash. Do the world a favor and don't buy their garbage.""  We agree!  Just visit The Hollywood Gossip instead!  We do not charge a thing to read our celebrity news stories and we (mostly) guarantee that they are never fake.  The 40-year-old actor was mostly known for his amazing body and handsome face prior to falling for Vergara.  He opened up in the April issue of Ocean Drive magazine about being a part of a famous twosome these days.  ""I was never part of a celebrity couple before this, because I never wanted to go through the difficulty that can bring in terms of paparazzi and attention,"" he said at the time.  ""The two of us knew that once it became public that we were together -- and we had conversations about how that would change a lot of thing.  ""[Vergara] is the only woman on the planet that I was willing to go through all of that for, because she’s the greatest.""  Everyone together now: AWWWWWW!  Manganiello added that the attention hasn't harmed their relationship at all.  Quite the opposite, in fact.  ""All that pressure has just brought us closer together,"" he says.  ""It’s not something that we welcome into our lives. We try to stay private.  ""At the end of the day, it’s really nobody else’s business but ours. It’s just that I love her and she loves me and here we are. And there is a price for that when living in the public eye.”"	0
It’s bad enough when you’re out and about and you see someone wearing your exact outfit, but when you’re famous and your accidental twinning goes viral on the Internet, that’s when you know things are kicked up a notch. Just the other day, Gigi Hadid and Lily Collins stepped out in the same pair of jeans, but luckily both ladies looked fab in their own rights so there was no need for the tacky “who wore it better” conversation. Glad that’s over!  The twinning happened last week when both stars coincidentally slipped on the same $150 pair of light-washed Black Orchid jeans. To make matters worse, they also both decided to pair the jeans with white tops, white sneakers and black motorcycle jackets. (Hey, great minds, right?)  Fortunately, the tops were noticeably different: The 22-year-old model (we mean Hadid, of course) sported a cropped band tee under her jacket, while the 28-year-old actress bundled up in a white collared shirt and cream Rails sweater. But, for the most part, the two looked like they could exchange outfits for the day and no one would notice.  So what’s the lesson learned here? 1. That both Hadid and Collins can rock the dopest frayed denim jeans 2. That more than one person can look good AF in the same outfit without getting pitted against each other. Next time, compliment the girl you unintentionally match with. She’s got great taste.	1

The twenty-first century has seen some truly iconic celebrity couples: Brangelina (Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie), Bennifer (both versions: Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez, and Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner), Kimye (Kanye West and Kim Kardashian West), and, of course: Jelena. Back in the day, Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez were the cutest couple around, and for a while, it really looked like those two crazy kids would really make a go of it.  Sadly, we all know how it worked out; seven years of “are they/aren’t they” drama that came to an explosive head last fall. After their widely-publicized Instagram feud, it seemed that the Jelena waters had calmed and everyone was moving on with their lives… until now! We’ve put together an exhaustive history to help you get re-acquainted with the story—and prepare you for its most recent update:  December 2010: Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez are spotted out and about together, but their relationship is only a rumour until…    February 2011: …They make their first red carpet appearance as a couple at the Vanity Fair Oscars party.  November 2011: A (bogus) paternity suit involving Biebs and a fan fuels the first breakup rumours.  May 2012: Selena deletes her Instagram account after posting a photo from a shooting range captioned “releasing some stress today,” which causes some to speculate that Jelena may have split.    June 2012: Breakup rumours are put to rest when they arrive to the premiere of Katy Perry: Part of Me together (wearing colour-coordinating outfits, no less).  October 2012: Justin posts a photo on Instagram with the caption “Lingse,” which many commenters note is an anagram of ‘single,’ but he deletes it and soon replaces it with a self-portrait captioned “just me” (which, honestly, is foreboding in its own way).  November 2012: The pair officially break up after nearly two years together, allegedly due to their conflicting schedules, and Justin begins to be linked to other women: VS model Barbara Palvin, whom he takes a photo with after performing at 2012’s Victoria Secret Fashion Show, and Miranda Kerr (who, at this time, is still married to Orlando Bloom).  December 2012: Justin and Selena are caught kissing at an airport in Salt Lake City, but then reportedly break up again after a big fight at an NYE party in Mexico.  January 2013: Selena posts a photo wearing a hat with the logo of Justin’s hometown hockey team (the Stratford Warriors, née Cullitons).  March 2013: Selena makes a jab at Justin while on the Late Show with David Letterman, when she says “that makes two of us” in response to Letterman’s admission that he had once made Justin cry on the show.    April 2013: Selena reportedly flies to Norway to see Justin, and he posts a quickly-deleted black and white photo of them together where they look very cuddly. The caption is “‘You’ve been makin music for too long babe come cuddle’ –her”.  May 2013: Selena greets Justin with a kiss on the cheek backstage at the Billboard Music Awards. It’s still unclear if they have officially reconciled.  July 2013: They spend the Fourth of July together, but in a subsequent interview Selena claims to be single.    January 2014: Justin posts a sweet photo of the two of them on Instagram captioned “love the way you look at me.”    March 2014: Selena attends a #WeDay party with a group that includes Orlando Bloom, whose ex-wife, you will remember, was rumoured to have gotten very close to Justin back in 2012.    April 2014: Justin and Selena have a fight at Coachella, allegedly due to the fact that Selena found photos of Kylie Jenner on Justin’s phone. Shortly after this, Selena is linked to Orlando after they are photographed sitting on a curb together outside a Chelsea Handler concert.    May 2014: Justin is linked romantically to various women, including Kylie, Adriana Lima, and Yovanna Ventura. He also previews a song that is almost definitely about Selena titled “It’s Working” (which, FYI, he never released).    June 2014: Jus	0
"Emily Ratajkowski wants to ""celebrate"" female sexuality.  The 26-year-old model and actress has said she wants to help women feel confident in their own skin and ""understand their sexuality"" without having to worry about the ""patriarchal male gaze"".  She said: ""I believe in sexuality. I think it's a wonderful thing and, if anything, I want women to understand their own sexuality outside of a patriarchal male gaze. We're the core of sexual beings, and I think that's something that should be celebrated rather than attacked.""  And the brunette beauty credits actress Emma Watson with shaping her idea of feminism, and making her realise the movement is a ""choice"".  She added: ""To start saying that certain people need to have a license to be feminist is insane. Emma Watson said feminism isn't some kind of tool to beat other women with, it's supposed to be a freedom of choice.""  The 'We Are Your Friends' actress believes that for women in Hollywood, there is a need to ""prove"" themselves to be ""dynamic"", as she claims her ultimate goal is to stop being cast as the 'hot girl' and become a more versatile actress.  Speaking to the August issue of Glamour UK magazine, Emily said: ""That's basically my strategy...and part of the reason I'm so grateful I have modelling and so many other things that I'm doing - because if I didn't have other ways of making money, I'd be like, 'OK, I guess I'm doing the bathing-suit-girl role.' You really have to prove yourself in this industry and I'm very much up for the challenge. It takes a really long time to not only prove yourself, but also prove that you're more dynamic than just this one part of you that they see."""	1

"With hits such as ""Vision of Love"" and ""I Don't Wanna Cry,"" pop diva Mariah Carey holds the record for most No. 1 debuts in Billboard Hot 100 history.  Who Is Mariah Carey? Mariah Carey was born March 27, 1970, in Huntington, Long Island, New York, and began taking voice lessons at age four. At 18 she signed with Columbia Records, and her first album had four No. 1 singles, including ""Vision of Love"" and ""I Don't Wanna Cry."" Carey went on to generate several more albums (later with other studios) and top singles, becoming one of the most commercially successful artists of all time with 18 No. 1 hits and more than 200 million records sold.  Early Life Singer Mariah Carey was born March 27, 1970, in Huntington, Long Island, New York, to Alfred Roy Carey, a Venezuelan aeronautical engineer; and Patricia Carey, a voice coach and opera singer. She has two older siblings: a brother, Morgan, and a sister, Alison. Carey's parents divorced when she was three years old. She stunned her mother by imitating her operatic singing as early as age two, and was given singing lessons starting at age four. Eventually, Carey would develop a voice that spanned five octaves. After graduating in 1987 from Harborfields High School in Greenlawn, New York, Carey moved to Manhattan where she worked as a waitress and a coat check girl and studied cosmetology, while writing songs and actively pursuing a music career at night. Early Music Career: 'Mariah Carey' and 'Emotions' When she was 18 years old, Carey and her friend, singer Brenda K. Starr, went to a party hosted by CBS Records. Starr convinced Carey to bring along one of her demo tapes. She intended to give the tape to Columbia's Jerry Greenberg, but Tommy Mottola, the president of Columbia Records (later Sony), intercepted it before she could hand it to Greenberg. After listening to the tape on the way home from the party, Mottola signed Carey immediately and set her to work on her first album, Mariah Carey (1990), which included four No. 1 singles: ""Vision of Love,"" ""Love Takes Time,"" ""Some Day,"" and ""I Don't Wanna Cry."" Her second album, Emotions, was released in 1992; the title track became her fifth No. 1 single, and included the hits ""Can't Let Go"" and ""Make it Happen."" 'Music Box,' 'Daydream,' 'Butterfly' In March 1992, Carey appeared on MTV's Unplugged. This performance was released as an album and a home video, resulting in another No. 1 single (a cover of The Jacksons' ""I'll Be There""). Her next album, Music Box (1993), cut back a bit on the lavish studio production techniques heard in her previous albums, and included the No. 1 singles ""Dreamlover"" and ""Hero."" Her November 1994 release, Merry Christmas, combined traditional Christian hymns with new songs. In 1995 she released Daydream; its first single, ""Fantasy,"" debuted at No. 1. It also included collaborations with R&B and hip-hop artists such as Wu-Tang Clan and Boyz II Men (""One Sweet Day""). Her 1997 album, Butterfly, included 11 compositions written by Carey, and demonstrated her continued interest in hip-hop and R&B, including the Sean ""Puffy"" Combs-produced ""Honey,"" her 12th No. 1 hit. Carey's 1998 album, #1's, featured her 13 previous chart-topping singles as well as the Academy Award-nominated ""The Prince of Egypt (When You Believe),"" a duet with fellow pop diva Whitney Houston.  'Glitter,' Hospitalization and New Record Deal In July 2001, Carey was admitted into a New York-area hospital and put under psychiatric care after suffering what her publicists called a ""physical and emotional collapse."" Carey had been preparing to promote her upcoming feature film debut, Glitter, and its accompanying soundtrack album, but cancelled all public appearances. The release of Glitter was subsequently pushed back from late August to late September 2001. Carey was released from the hospital after two weeks. In January 2002, Carey and EMI (the corporate owner of Virgin Records, with whom Carey had signed a reported $80 million contract in Apri"	0
R. Kelly isn’t the only one denying rumors that he’s been holding young girls hostage in an abusive sex cult at his homes in Atlanta and Chicago. One of the alleged victims of Kelly’s rumored sex cult is speaking out, saying that the disturbing claims against the music legend are totally untrue.  Jocelyn Savage, 21, whose family accused R. Kelly of holding their daughter hostage, says that she’s perfectly happy and safe — although she won’t reveal her whereabouts. She told TMZ, “I’m 21, I’m about to be 22 in a few days and I just mainly want to say that I am in a happy place with my life and I’m not being brainwashed or anything like that. It just came to a point where it definitely has got out of hand. I’m totally fine. I’m happy where I’m at and everything is okay with me.”  Savage said of her parents, “I’m very heartbroken over what’s going on with this situation because it’s getting to a point where it’s getting too much. It’s just not right.” When asked if she was being held involuntarily, she said, “Oh no, nothing like that. I’ve never felt like a hostage or anything like that.” However, Jocelyn will not confirm whether or not she’s in a relationship or dating the 50-year-old singer.  Her father Timothy believes she is suffering Stockholm Syndrome, a condition which sees hostages grow to love their captors. According to Buzzfeed reporter Jim Derogatis, who first reported the story, R. Kelly is currently being investigated by the FBI.  Watch: R. Kelly’s Alleged Hostage Breaks Her Silence About Sex Cult Accusations was originally published on globalgrind.com	1

This is something they both want. Selena has always liked the idea of being a young mum and Justin is desperate to settle down.” Okay, setting aside that this is rumor is just a rumor, this doesn’t even sound like Selena!

Cathy Yan has been tapped to direct a DC spinoff movie centered on crazed supervillain Harley Quinn. The girl gang movie will be based on the “Birds of Prey” comic, with Margot Robbie attached to star.  Robbie’s LuckyChap is producing with Sue Kroll and her Kroll & Co Entertainment, along with Bryan Unkeless of Clubhouse Pictures.  Yan, a former Wall St. Journal reporter who made her feature debut with Sundance entry “Dead Pigs,” will be the second female filmmaker to direct a DC film, following Patty Jenkins with “Wonder Woman.” She will also be the first Asian woman to helm a movie from the DC Comics universe. DC previously tapped Ava DuVernay to direct “New Gods,” which is still in development.  Christina Hodson, who was recently tapped to pen the “Batgirl” pic, wrote the script. The studio had been weighing several Quinn options, including a “Suicide Squad” sequel with Gavin O’Connor, before picking “Birds of Prey.” Sources add that script is still being worked on, but Yan is likely to take over directing reins once the script is done.  Production is expected to start at the end of the year after Robbie finishes shooting Quentin Tarantino’s “Once Upon a Time in Hollywood,” for which she is currently in negotiations to play Sharon Tate.  The sequel to the Harley Quinn-starring “Suicide Squad” is also expected to begin production in 2018. Gavin O’Connor is on board to write the sequel and is also in talks to direct the film that co-stars Will Smith and Jared Leto.  Yan is repped by CAA. Deadline Hollywood first reported the news.	1

"Something old, something new, something borrowed, something blue. The old English rhyme dictating four good luck charms for a bride on her wedding day is a popular tradition the world over, and the new Duchess of Sussex was no exception.  Meghan's first wedding gown, a Givenchy Haute Couture creation by Clare Waight Keller, was just one ""something new"" for the big day. Also by Givenchy were the veil, which represented all 53 countries of the Commonwealth in its design, and the shoes, pointed pumps in silk duchess satin. Her jewelry, diamond earrings and a bracelet, were by Cartier.  Meghan borrowed her tiara from the Queen, while her Cartier earrings were new. Getty Images  Meghan’s bouquet included Princess Diana’s favorite flower, forget me nots, a sentimental ""something blue"" Getty Images  The diamond and platinum bandeau tiara worn by Meghan with her ceremony gown qualifies as her ""something old"" and ""something borrowed"". The tiara was made for Queen Mary in 1932, with the centre brooch dating back to 1893. It was loaned to Meghan by the Queen for the occasion.  Meghan and Harry's florist, Philippa Craddock, also worked a ""something old"" into the bouquet—sprigs of myrtle from a plant grown from the myrtle used in the Queen’s wedding bouquet of 1947. And as a ""something blue"", Craddock also included forget-me-nots, Princess Diana's favorite flower.  According to rumor, a piece of fabric from Princess Diana's wedding gown was sewn into Meghan's dress. That too would be a fitting ""something old"".  Meghan also incorporated the traditions in her evening look for the wedding reception at Frogmore House. The bespoke Stella McCartney silk crepe gown was, of course, new, as were her shoes by Aquazzura made in silky satin, with nude mesh, and soles painted in baby blue—a ""something blue"".    Meghan’s Stella McCartney evening gown was another ""something new"", while the soles of her shoes were painted baby blue as a ""something blue"". Getty Images  It was a breathtaking aquamarine cocktail ring from Princess Diana's collection that was the most obvious ""something blue"", as well as a ""something old"", and perhaps ""something borrowed"" too, though many are assuming that this ring was not borrowed but gifted to Meghan by her new husband. Princess Diana left her jewelry to the wives of her sons in her will, and given that Meghan wasn't officially a married woman until the end of the ceremony, she may have chosen to wait to wear a piece from Diana's collection until after the marriage was official."	1
"Prince George of Cambridge knows exactly what he wants for Christmas — and he isn't messing around. During Prince William's visit to Finland, he presented Santa Claus with Prince George's Christmas list. Not only does this mean the public gets to experience George's handwriting for the first time, but we also have further insight into the 4-year-old royal's wishes and dreams for the perfect holiday.  In his letter, not only did George circle that he has been ""nice,"" rather than ""naughty"" this year, but he wrote down he wants a ""police car."" He even signed his name (just ""George"") at the bottom.  According to Hello! Canada, William told Santa at the Christmas market in Helsinki, ""I've seen you and I had to give you this letter."" He then added about his son, ""He hasn't written down many requests, so I think one request is probably OK."" William also made sure Santa paid attention to how George was ""nice"" this year. ""He's been a nice boy, a nice boy,"" he said.  George had the opportunity to list five presents he wanted for Christmas, but didn't. He only wrote down one item — and an important one at that. You have you to admire his definitiveness. Unlike many children, he didn't list a bunch of different gifts. Maybe he's hoping that by including one only thing it ensures he'll actually get it?  It's unclear if George is wishing for an actual police car or a toy version, but it seems more than likely he wants the latter — and that's what he'll probably receive on Dec. 25. It's highly doubtful his parents — oops Santa, will gift him with his own police car that he can't even drive.  Either way, the fact that he has only one gift request speaks volumes. He clearly isn't greedy. Yes, he's a prince and is given luxuries that many aren't privy to, so maybe he already had so much stuff that the one thing missing from his life is a police car. Though, William and Kate Middleton seem to be raising their children to be appreciative of what they have in life, all while wanting them to have a ""normal"" of a life as possible.  As William once said about his children in a May interview with British GQ, ""I couldn't do my job without the stability of the family. Stability at home is so important to me. I want to bring up my children in a happy, stable, secure world, and that is so important to both of us as parents."" He then added about his son, ""I want George to grow up in a real, living environment, I don't want him growing up behind palace walls, he has to be out there. The media make it harder but I will fight for them to have a normal life.""  The 35-year-old activist was also quick to recognize he and his family don't live the average life. After being asked, ""But surely you must accept it as an abnormal life?"", he responded, ""Totally, but I can still try to protect them as children.""  Based on George's wish list for Christmas, it's probably safe to say that William's hopes of ensuring both George and Princess Charlotte remain children as long as possible is a reality. So many kids these days want huge gifts, like smartphones, tablets, computers, or video game systems, so to see that George seemingly wants a toy car shows his innocence — and it's truly refreshing.  The fact that George opened up his Christmas gifts early in December 2016, according to Kiss FM DJ AJ King (via Hello!) also shows just how much a kid he remains at heart. ""I had a really nice chat with Prince William who told me that this was their last week at work, as it were, before Christmas,"" King said. ""[William] said they were all really excited about it and that George is already opening his presents. He thought it a quite funny. That's kids for you, even the ones that are princes!""  As for Charlotte, it's unclear what she wants for Christmas. Whatever she's hoping for is probably as sweet and childlike as her older brother's wish."	1
ABC’s revival of “Roseanne” slipped double digits from its premiere last week but still dominated broadcast on Tuesday night in the overnight ratings.  “Roseanne” averaged a 3.9 rating in adults 18-49 and 15.2 million viewers. The first two episodes of “Roseanne,” airing back-to-back last week, stunned industry analysts when they averaged a 5.2 and 18.4 million viewers between them. That means this week’s episode was down 25% in the demo and 17% in total viewers. However, only one episode aired this week and it was always likely that it would see some kind of decline.  The “Roseanne” bump translated into a good night for “The Middle,” which was up significantly airing immediately after the revival with a 2.2 and 8.3 million viewers. That is a new season high in both measures for the comedy series. “Black-ish” (1.5, 5.4 million) and “Splitting Up Together” (1.4, 4.8 million) both came down from the increases they saw thanks to “Roseanne” last week, but were still the top shows in their half hour time slots in the key demo. “For the People” drew a 0.8 and 2.8 million viewers at 10.  For NBC, “The Voice” (1.8, 9.3 million) was even while “Rise” (0.9, 4.5 million) ticked up in the demo, as was “Chicago Med” (1.1, 6.2 million).  On CBS, “NCIS” (1.3, 12.1 million), “Bull” (1.2, 11 million), and “NCIS: New Orleans” (0.9, 8.5 million) were even.  On Fox, “LA to Vegas” (0.7, 2 million) ticked up in the demo while the season finale of “The Mick” (0.7, 1.9 million) was even.  On The CW, a new episode of “Black Lightning” (0.5, 1.5 million) was even.  ABC won the night in the demo with a 1.8 but finished third in total viewers with 6.6 million. CBS and NBC tied for second in the demo with a 1.2 but CBS was first in viewers with 10.5 million. NBC was second in viewers with 6.7 million. Fox was fourth with a 0.6 and 1.9 million. The CW averaged a 0.4 and 1.2 million viewers.	1
Between the viral Making a Murderer on Netflix to the wildly popular American Crime Story: The People v. O.J. Simpson on FX, it’s not hard to see that the true-crime genre is having a moment. A distant cousin of reality TV, true-crime cuts through the manufactured drama of scripted entertainment and brings raw and real and riveting stories to life unlike anything else that’s out there.  “The job of any good documentary filmmaker is to find a good story and don’t [mess] it up,” says Billy Corben, the mastermind the true-crime classic Cocaine Cowboys and a dozen other slick and stylish documentaries. “Just find a good story and tell it well.” Based on Corben’s criteria, now that you’ve finished bingeing Making a Murderer, here are some suggestions for your next true-crime watch.

We dare you not to focus on Ariana Grande‘s impressive engagement ring.  https://www.eonline.com/news/944427/ariana-grande-s-ring-takes-center-stage-for-her-first-public-appearance-since-getting-engaged	1
Is she or isn't she? Katie Holmes is sparking rumors that she might be engaged after stepping out in New Orleans wearing a massive diamond ring on her left hand. And while the bling is very telling, it sounds like the actress, 39, may not be ready for that next step just yet.  Holmes, who is currently filming upcoming movie The Secret, was apparently only wearing the rock for the flick. A rep for Holmes told People the ring is not an engagement ring.  “Katie’s not engaged to anyone besides her fictional movie fiancé, played by Jerry O’Connell,” her rep said.  It's not surprising that fans were speculating about her relationship status: Holmes has been dating actor Jamie Foxx since August 2013, just one year after her split from Tom Cruise. Though Foxx and Holmes have kept their relationship largely private, the two have been photographed together more and more in the past year.  In May, a source told People that the couple are still cautious about being seen together.  “Everyone knows they are dating, but they still want to keep it private,” the insider said. “After the beach pictures, they only spent time together at home and got extra careful. But this year, they have been more social together. They often go to restaurants for dinner dates, or to hang out with friends.”	0

All right, Shondaland fans, the longest-running show of ABC’s TGIT lineup is finally back this week with Season 14 premiere of “Grey’s Anatomy.” We’re breaking down everything you need to know from last season ahead of Thursday episode. Ready to scrub in?  1. Dr. Edwards quits  Let’s start with Dr. Stephanie Edwards (Jerrika Hinton), since her storyline ended with a literal bang, and her absence from the show will leave a snark-shaped hole in our hearts. After getting perpetually hounded by Dr. Minnick (Marika Dominczyk), she was put on leave until completing therapy.  Edwards convinces Dr. Webber (James Pickens Jr.) to sign off on her return just in time to help Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), Maggie Pierce (Kelly McCreary), Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams) and April Kepner (Sarah Drew) with a couple whose car went off a cliff.  Also Read: How Is Meredith Grey Still Alive? Let Us Break Down Her Most Perilous Moments  They come into the hospital in various states of undress, and the doctors assume the couple accidentally shifted the gear while getting it on in the car. But no, the story isn’t as would-be romantic as the docs imagine.  It turns out the the woman, Allison, was actually trying to escape from the man, Keith, who was trying to rape her. The residents don’t find this out in time, however, and Keith tricks Edwards into taking him out of his room.  What follows is a chain of events that reminds us of some of “Grey’s” classic disaster episodes. When Allison wakes up, she alerts Bailey and the others to Keith’s threat and the hospital goes into lock down.  Also Read: Jason George to Leave 'Grey's Anatomy' for Firefighter Spinoff  Keith, aware that he’s been found out, orders Edwards to help him escape the hospital. But because of the lockdown, all the exit doors are locked. They end up in an abandoned wing of the hospital, where they run into Erin (Darby Camp), a young girl who’s been wandering the halls while she waits for her little sister to be discharged.  Keith is trying to start a fire so the doors will open, but Edwards manages to set him on fire instead. But when Keith runs too close to some chemicals in an abandoned lab, he causes a huge explosion. Edwards somehow survives, but Erin is injured. She is able to get them both out into the stairwell, but not before jumping through some flames.  Eventually, they make it to the roof, and Dr. Ben Warren (Jason George) and some firefighters find them. They both survive, but Edwards decides she’s done working in the hospital for now, and tells Dr. Webber that she’s quit.  2. Megan Hunt is alive  Meanwhile, some serious developments are happening in Dr. Owen Hunt’s (Kevin McKidd) relationship with Dr. Amelia Shepherd (Caterina Scorsone) — and in Meredith Grey’s (Ellen Pompeo) relationship with Nathan Riggs (Martin Henderson).  If you remember, Riggs and Hunt used to be best buds, and Riggs used to date Hunt’s sister Megan (Abigail Spencer). They were all in the Army together, and when Megan went missing, everyone assumed she died. But Hunt finds out that she’s still alive, and Amelia takes over organizing logistics as he’s in shock. And guess who Amelia organizes logistics with?  Also Read: Kate Walsh on Brain Tumor Removal: 'It Was a Really Big Wake-Up Call'  3. Dr. Teddy Altman returns    That’s right. Kim Raver’s back for Season 14.  As for how this news affects Meredith, well, she tells Riggs to go with Hunt and Amelia to see Megan. “If it were Derek, I’d already be gone,” Meredith tells Riggs, totally breaking our hearts all over again.  Meredith was previously worried about how spending so much time with Riggs would affect Maggie (who used to have a huge crush on him) and her children. Will Riggs get back together with Megan, or will what she’s been through strain their old flame? If he doesn’t get back together with her, will he be able to stay with Meredith?  4. Dr. Minnick gets fired  Then we come to Minnick, who during the lockdown/fire disaster wasn’t as helpfu	1
"President Donald Trump is causing an uproar again this morning after a bizarre interview where he praised President Andrew Jackson and questioned the reason behind the Civil War. His remarks were from a radio conversation with Sirius XM's Salena Zito on Monday morning.  ""I mean had Andrew Jackson been a little later you wouldn't have had the Civil War. He was a really tough person, but he had a big heart,"" Trump said, despite the fact that Jackson was behind Native American removal, the Trail of Tears and owned about 150 slaves.  ""He was really angry that he saw what was happening with regard to the Civil War, he said, 'There's no reason for this,'"" Trump added. Jackson died in 1845. The Civil War began in 1861.  ""People don't realize, you know, the Civil War, if you think about it, why?,"" he added, seeming to forget the basic curriculum of an American history class. ""People don't ask that question, but why was there a Civil War? Why could that one not have been worked out?"" Hint: slavery. Another hint: ""states' rights.""

Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie supported each other when they were a couple. Even after their split in September 2016, none of the stars have publicly spoken ill about the other one. Angelina Jolie’s recent podcast conversation has made some to believe that the reason behind her split with husband Brad Pitt was her cancer scare. One publication, Philippine Daily Inquirer, even reported that Jolie supposedly said her health concerns led to her divorce with Pitt. Reportedly, the actor was afraid of her cancer and decided to end the marriage.  In a recent interview on the Hollywood Reporter‘s podcast for her film First They Killed My Father, Angelina Jolie candidly revealed that her health problems reportedly took a toll on her married life with Brad Pitt.  Back in 2013, Angelina Jolie underwent a preventive double mastectomy after learning from her doctors that she had an 87 percent risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene. Angelina’s mother, Marcheline Bertrand, also had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer when she was just 56 years old. Her double mastectomy lowered her chances of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, and Angelina Jolie followed it up with a reconstructive surgery involving allografts and implants.  “I do not feel any less of a woman. I feel empowered that I made a strong choice that in no way diminishes my femininity,” she wrote in one of her op-eds for the New York Times.  Featured image credit: Rich Fury Getty Images for THR  Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie Pitt play a couple at a crossroads in their relationship in #ByTheSea, in select theaters November 13. A post shared by By The Sea (@bytheseamovie) on Nov 10, 2015 at 3:28pm PST  Gossip Cop debunked the Inquirer‘s claims and stated that Jolie’s cancer scare did not play a role in her and Pitt’s divorce. The site also confirmed that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie’s divorce was not caused by infidelity or because of any involvement of a third party, claims that were mentioned in the Inquirer report. In reality, the September 2016 split was caused after a drunken Brad Pitt got into an argument with their son Maddox aboard a plane.  Gossip Cop made it clear that during her recent interview, Angelina was only talking about her film By The Sea and all the difficulties she had to face during her work on that project.  Loading...  Despite all the claims or speculations that Brad Pitt was afraid of Angelina Jolie’s cancer and decided to end the marriage, the Fight Club movie actor told in the past that Angelina did all the surgeries for their kids and her family.  “There was no vanity to my wife’s approach. It was mature. There was a strength in that. It was just another one of those things in life that makes you tighter and she was doing it for the kids, and she was doing it for her family so we could be together,” Brad Pitt revealed during his previous interview on The Today Show.  Angelina Jolie also confessed during the podcast that she became an actress so that she can pay her late mother Marcheline Bertrand’s bills. Despite the initial success, the actress revealed she never truly felt at home in front of the camera. The actress-turned-director added that acting is a creative job and it helped her in exploring different times in history.	0
Prince Harry will be embarking on one of life’s great adventures by tying the knot with humanitarian and actress Meghan Markle.  Last month, thousands of people signed a petition demanding that the royal family fund the wedding themselves and not take any money from the British taxpayer.  With that in mind, the net worth of the royal family and Prince Harry have becoming interesting topics of conversation.  Download the new Indpendent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  Here’s everything you need to know about Prince Harry’s age, royal status and net worth as he prepares to welcome Ms Markle into the fold.  What’s his royal status and occupation?  Prince Harry, who was born Henry Charles Albert David on September 15 1984, is formally known as Prince Henry of Wales. He’s currently 33 years old.  He’s sixth in line to the throne behind his father the Prince of Wales, his older brother the Duke of Cambridge, his nephew Prince George, his niece Princess Charlotte and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge’s third child, who is expected to arrive later this month.  Prince Harry began his military career when he entered the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in 2005.  He’s since served in the British Army and ventured to Afghanistan with the Army Air Corps for a 20-week deployment from 2012 to 2013.  In 2014, Prince Harry launched the Invictus Games to celebrate wounded, injured or sick members of the armed forces from around the world.  In addition to being a patron for the Invictus Games Foundation, Prince Harry is also a patron for the HALO Trust, the London Marathon Charitable Trust and Walking With The Wounded.  What’s his net worth?  As can be expected as a member of the royal family, Prince Harry doesn’t have to worry about much when it comes to his finances.  Prince William and Prince Harry both have an estimated net worth of approximately £28m, according to The Richest.  When the royal turned 30 in 2014, he inherited a trust of around £10m from his late mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, as stated by royal expert Marlene Koenig.  Prince William and Prince Harry also jointly inherited their late mother's estate, in addition to her private jewellery collection.  According to Forbes, Prince William and Prince Harry received annual dividends of around £321,313 per year from the age of 25.  Prince Harry is also taken care of by the Duchy of Cornwall, as son of Prince Charles, the Duke of Cornwall.  The Duchy of Cornwall is a private estate that was established in 1337 by King Edward III.  It’s currently overseen by Prince Charles and continues to cover expenses for Prince William and Prince Harry.  How does he earn money?  While Prince Harry has inherited a dear amount of money, he has also earned his fair share from his previous role within the army. Prince Harry officially left the army in 2015.  While serving as an officer in the Army Air Corps, he was reportedly granted a salary of around £32,134 per year, as stated by Fortune.  However, Forbes has also claimed that Prince Harry received between £35,704 and £37,840 while working as a helicopter pilot for the Army Air Corps.  This article has been updated. It was originally published in April 2018.	1

"Fans of holiday cheer and iconic rom-coms everywhere couldn't help but freak out after it was announced that Love Actually was getting a mini-sequel — and based on these first behind-the-scenes snapshots from producer Emma Freud, it's going to be epic.

by CORINNE HELLER | Fri., Feb. 2, 2018 2:19 PM  Want to look as fit as Gwyneth Paltrow? You’ll have to work hard for it…and clear your schedule.  Steve Granitz/WireImage  The Oscar winner and Goop lifestyle company founder has for years utilized the help of celebrity trainer Tracy Anderson, creator of the Tracy Anderson Method.  “Gwyneth really focuses on a total body workout,” Tracy Anderson Method VP of Training Maria Kelling told E! News’ Justin Sylvester. “She’s been doing it for so long. We’re constantly changing things up.”  She then demonstrated some moves, including arm and standing ab workouts as well as a more advanced one that makes you look like you’re break-dancing.  “Lately, Gwyneth’s really been liking moves where you’re stretching and contracting,” she said.  And if you’re going to work out like Paltrow, you’ve going to have to go hard; Belling said the actress work out at the studio every day for two hours!  In 2014, Anderson also talked to E! News about working with Paltrow on her fitness, saying the actress had “some problem areas” when they first met and was now “in great shape.” In 2013, the trainer told Into the Gloss that the actress previously had “ 35 extra pounds on her ,” adding, “her butt was long and she had outer thigh problems.””The best thing has ever taught me is that there are no shortcuts, which sucks,” Paltrow told E! News that year. “I used to think, ‘Oh, you know, I’ll just like diet or do a juice fast or I’ll skip and go for a run,’ and no, it’s consistency and discipline and she embodies that.” “Some people look at celebrities and they think ‘oh, they have it better than me,’ and it’s just not true! Some celebrities are doing some unhealthy things,” Anderson told E! News. “But someone like Gwyneth, I like to celebrate because she is really just a good example.”  Read the full article.

Parisian-based fashion house, KENZO, has named Britney Spears as its newest spokesperson, with a campaign called Kenzo Presents Britney Spears, with its own hashtag, #kenzolovesbritney. After several teaser shots of the new campaign—officially called “La Collection Memento N°2“—KENZO and Spears finally unveiled their partnership on their social media channels.  The campaign, shot by legendary photographer Peter Lindbergh, focuses on the idea of cultural icons—something that Spears wholeheartedly embodies. With a heavy focus on denim and the quintessential KENZO motifs, the collection is vast and wide ranging for both men, women and some pieces that may be worn by both genders. One of those motifs, for which KENZO had become internationally recognized, is “the jumping tiger,” developed by Kenzo Takada in the 1970s.  “I was really flattered when KENZO approached me to the face of their 50th anniversary line,” began Spears. “I love the brand, and with denim being a big part of this collection, it made it that much more appealing to me since denim is such a part of my own style.” (Who could ever forget her matching denim-on-denim moment on the Grammy’s red carpet with then-beau Justin Timberlake?)  The collection elevates the ever-popular “athleisure” trend. For the main ad campaign shot, Britney Spears wears the Cropped ‘Bamboo Tiger’ Sweatshirt, the Denim ‘Bamboo Tiger’ Denim Baseball Cap (already sold out), The Mini Denim ‘Kanagawa Wave’ Rucksack and the Denim Shorts.  The collaboration certainly is a match made in heaven. Spears’ is a timeless, American icon, and her reign as the queen of pop will surely last generations to come.  All photos from KENZO website.	1
"Selena Gomez has switched her Instagram to private mode.  The 25-year-old pop star changed her settings late Monday, after posting a cryptic Instagram story which seemed to be directed at Billboard magazine regarding a recent profile of the star.  A super-cropped screenshot of the story was paired with text that read: 'Never will I let another human being guess my words ever again. Or invite them in my home.'  Feelings hurt: Selena Gomez (above Monday) switched her Instagram to private after sharing a cryptic story post which seemed to call out a profile of the starlet published in Billboard  Still lots looking: While Selena's shut the door on new followers and those just browsing, her page is still available to the 130million people who follow the star  Her message continued: 'That is so hurtful. The most ""ridiculous"" part of that is no one knowing my heart when I say things.'  While Selena's shut the door on new followers and those just browsing, her page is still available to the 130million people who follow the star. She is one of the most popular celebrities on the platform.  The portion of the Billboard article - which was written by Brooke Mazurek - in question opens the piece, describing a giant teddy bear in the Fetish singer's living room which she says was 'a gift.'  It read: 'There’s a five-foot teddy bear sprawled across the kitchen floor in Selena Gomez’s North Hollywood home.  Putting up her guard: The profile, which was published with the star's Woman Of The Year honor from the mag, prompted Gomez to declare 'Never will I let another human being guess my words ever again. Or invite them in my home' while also adding the story was 'hurtful'  Piece of her mind: The portion of the Billboard article in question opens the piece, describing a giant teddy bear in the Fetish singer's living room which she says was 'a gift'  '""I know, I know,"" says Gomez, rolling her eyes, acknowledging that the stuffed animal doesn’t quite blend with the trio of armchairs nestled in the inviting, marble-accented nook,' wrote Brooke.  The writer says Gomez said: 'It was a gift, and at first I thought, ""This is so ridiculous, I can’t wait until I give it away to another person."" But Gomez, 25, hasn’t let go of it — yet.'  The day before Gomez appeared to slam the magazine, she shared another mysterious Instagram that had the caption: 'I need some alone time.'  While Selena's not happy with the music publication, Billboard is clearly a fan of the starl, who they bestowed with the Woman Of The Year award in late November.  All eyes on her! While Selena's not happy with the music mag, Billboard is clearly a fan of the starlet, who they bestowed with the Woman of the Year award November 30, above  It was unclear what exactly about the article 'hurt' the Wizards Of Waverly Place star and caused her to change her account, but Selena has been very vocal about her need to keep an arm's length from social media these days.  After becoming the most followed figure on Instagram back in March, the Texan told Vogue: 'I sort of freaked out. [Social media] had become so consuming to me. It’s what I woke up to and went to sleep to. I was an addict,' she said.  '...It felt like I was seeing things I didn’t want to see, like it was putting things in my head that I didn’t want to care about.  'I always end up feeling like sh** when I look at Instagram. Which is why I’m kind of under the radar, ghosting it a bit.'  Reunited and it feels so good! The former Disney star desire for privacy might have to do with her personal life, having recently reunited with childhood love Justin Bieber (above November)  Selena's personal life is another reason she might be closing the curtains.

James Corden denied being the 'drunkest' person at the 2018 Met Gala.  In an interview last month on The Howard Stern Show, Andy Cohen - who attended the annual fashion event in early May - claimed Corden was the 'drunken guest'.  But the 39-year-old TV host visited Stern's studio on Tuesday and explained it wasn't intoxication but 'just my natural exuberance of life'.  Denial! James Corden denied being the 'drunkest' person at the 2018 Met Gala  He explained he rarely drinks because of his schedule adding: 'I think people often think I'm drunk just because I'm just having such a nice time.'  Corden attended the New York fete with his wife Julia Carey as they enjoyed a rare night out together.  'The reason I was having such a nice time is that my wife and I were away together for the first time in like a year and a half.  'We had a baby six months ago. We have three kids now and we had never left them before,' he explained.  Gossip king: In an interview last month on The Howard Stern Show , Andy Cohen - who attended the annual fashion event in early May - claimed Corden was the 'drunken guest'  Corden and Carey share son Max, 7, and daughters Carey, 3, and Charlotte, whom they welcomed in December 2017.  'I didn't have to wake up the next day until like 10 a.m. and that was inconceivable to me,' he added.  Cohen did clarify in his initial interview by adding: 'But by the way, he wasn't like blotto blotto. He was having a good time. He's great.'  Rare night out: Corden attended the New York fete with his wife Julia Carey as they enjoyed a rare night out together  The interview comes after reports James reportedly stole the limelight from Prince Harry and Meghan Markle at their wedding reception by dressing as Henry VIII.  The actor and US talk show host, who attended the reception with his wife Julia, acted as compere for the evening, apparently turning up dressed in full Tudor regalia according to one guest.  While many guests were left wiping away their tears after Meghan read an emotional poem about her new husband, James provided light relief with his hilarious turn as the erstwhile monarch.

I hope I've come in the right gear,' the Sunday Times reported.	1

Prince George and Princess Charlotte have also stolen the hearts of the public with their outfits as two of the pageboys and bridesmaids.  The bride arrived with her father Michael at around 11.15am in an open-top classic car. She’s wearing a bespoke Giles Deacon dress, designed to create the impression of being seamless.  “I was thrilled to work with Pippa on her wedding dress,” Deacon said. “The dress is constructed with a cap sleeve, high neckline and features a corseted bodice with draping to the front and a heart-shaped detail at the back.  “The bespoke silk cotton lace was hand appliqued to create an illusion of the dress having 'no seams'. The lace bodice is embroidered with pearl detailing over an organza and tulle underskirt, which has layer upon layer to enable a floor sweeping movement.  “It's a privilege to show the craftsmanship that my team produces in London and a real testament to Pippa's support of British fashion.”  33-year-old party planner Pippa accessorised her dress with a Stephen Jones veil, a Maidenhair Fern tiara and Manolo Blahnik ivory satin shoes.  Around 100 guests were expected and hundreds of royal fans have descended on the quiet village for the occasion, some travelling from the other side of the world especially.  Matthews was previously considered one of the most eligible bachelors in the world, and is reportedly worth £2 billion.  Comparisons have also been made between Pippa and her sister Kate’s husbands, some pointing out the ‘old money’ vs ‘new money’ distinction.  On social media, many people are fascinated with the proceedings.  Not everyone is convinced all the fuss is necessary though.  Royal or not, no doubt people will continue be interested in the marriage of the couple.  The Independent's Millennial Love group is the best place to discuss to the highs and lows of modern dating and relationships. Join the conversation here.​	1

"For other people with the same name, see Charles Murphy  American actor  Charles Quinton Murphy (July 12, 1959 – April 12, 2017) was an American actor, comedian, and writer. Murphy was best known as a writer and cast member of the Comedy Central sketch-comedy series Chappelle's Show, and as the costar of the sitcom Black Jesus. He was the older brother of comedian Eddie Murphy and the older half-brother of Vernon Lynch Jr.  Early life [ edit ]  Murphy was born on July 12, 1959, in the New York City borough of Brooklyn.[3] His mother, Lillian, was a telephone operator, and his father, Charles Edward Murphy, was a transit police officer and an amateur actor and comedian who died in 1969.[4]  As an adolescent, Murphy spent 10 months in jail.[5] In 1978, on the day he was released from jail,[6] he enlisted in the United States Navy and served for six years as a boiler technician.[7]  Career [ edit ]  Murphy had minor roles in several films in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and worked behind the scenes with the hip hop group K-9 Posse, a duo composed of his half-brother Vernon Lynch Jr. and Wardell Mahone. On their 1988 self-titled debut, Murphy was credited as the album's executive producer as well as songwriter on the songs ""Somebody's Brother"" and ""Say Who Say What"".[8] He also made an appearance in the video for the duo's first single ""This Beat Is Military"".[9] Murphy's first major role in a motion picture was in the 1993 film CB4, where he portrayed the antagonist, Gusto.  Murphy achieved fame as a recurring performer on Chappelle's Show, particularly in the Charlie Murphy's True Hollywood Stories sketches. In these, Murphy recounts his misadventures as part of his brother Eddie's entourage, including encounters with various celebrities such as Rick James and Prince.[10][11] After Chappelle's Show host Dave Chappelle left the show, Murphy and Donnell Rawlings hosted the ""lost episodes"" compiled from sketches produced before Chappelle's departure.  In 2005, he appeared in King's Ransom (alongside Anthony Anderson and Jay Mohr). In the film, Murphy portrayed ""Herb"", a gay ex-con who is hired by King (Anderson) to kidnap him in a fake kidnapping.[12] Murphy has done voiceovers for Budweiser radio commercials, provided the voice for Iraq War veteran/criminal Ed Wuncler III on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim series The Boondocks, and the voice for a pimp named Jizzy-B in Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas video game. Murphy provided the voice for Spock on the G4TV's Star Trek 2.0 shorts, and the dog in his younger brother Eddie's 2007 film, Norbit.[13]  On March 20, 2009, his own sketch comedy series Charlie Murphy's Crash Comedy began on Crackle.[14] A stand-up special, Charlie Murphy: I Will Not Apologize premiered on Comedy Central in late February 2010.[15] Murphy also made special appearances in 1000 Ways to Die and the TBS sitcom Are We There Yet? as Frank Kingston. In 2014–15, Murphy played Vic on the Adult Swim live action show Black Jesus.[16]  Personal life and death [ edit ]  Murphy was a resident of Tewksbury Township, New Jersey.[17] He was married to Tisha Taylor Murphy from 1997 until her death from cervical cancer in December 2009.[1] The couple had two children together, and Murphy had another child from a previous relationship.[1] He was a karate practitioner.[18][19]  Murphy died from leukemia on April 12, 2017, at the age of 57.[20][21]  Filmography [ edit ]  Film [ edit ]  Television [ edit ]  Video games [ edit ]"	0
Many entertainment stars love the finer things in life, but it seems even the earnings of an A-lister like Johnny Depp couldn’t sustain his wild indulgences.  The “Pirates of the Caribbean” star is currently in a public-relations tailspin after his messy divorce with actress Amber Heard, who alleged he had abused her, and his filing a $25 million lawsuit against his former business managers at The Management Group. (TMG has countersued.)  Things didn’t get any better for Depp on Wednesday when The Hollywood Reporter published a feature that went deeper into Depp’s financial woes.  TMG’s Joel Mandel claims that even though Depp has earned more than $650 million in the more than 13 years the company represented the star, Depp didn’t have enough cash to cover his $2 million in bills each month.  Depp’s extravagant spending habits reportedly include $3.6 million annually for his 40-person staff, $350,000 monthly for maintaining his 156-foot yacht, $30,000 monthly for wine, and $5 million the star says he spent to shoot the ashes of his friend Hunter S. Thompson out of a cannon.  TMG says it met with Depp numerous times over the years to try to get Depp to sell some of his expensive items. On one occasion, he agreed to sell his $10 million yacht that he spent $8 million to renovate, according to The Hollywood Reporter. Another year, TMG almost got Depp to sell his French chateau – on which he spent $10 million to renovate – but he got cold feet after prospective buyers came calling, according to the former business managers, and it has since been relisted for $39 million.

TMG attorney Michael Kump said in the lawsuit that TMG stepped in to help Depp avert a “devastating financial collapse.” Depp has claimed he was kept in the dark about his finances.  It’s unclear how cash-strapped Depp is. According to litigation, he has received $25.7 million over the past two years in profits from six movies, and he earned up-front money – likely close to $20 million each – from “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them,” “LAbyrinth,” and “Gnomeo & Juliet: Sherlock Gnomes.”  A representative for Depp did not immediately respond to Business Insider’s request for comment.	1
Despite their lives being turned upside down from the wildfires raging through Southern California, it seems Kim and Kanye are focused on what matters.  The mother-of-three took to Instagram to share a sweet moment between her husband and their youngest child, nine-month-old Chicago.  In the image, the chubby cheeked baby looked off into the distance as her 41-year-old-father planted a smooch on her head.  Daddy daughter time: Kim Kardashian shared a sweet moment with husband Kanye West planting a kiss on their nine-month-old daughters head in an Instagram post on Tuesday  The 38-year-old reality star captioned the image with no words and just a simple happy emoji.  The last few days have been a trying time for the Kardashian-West family.  Kanye took to Twitter on Monday night to announce that he is delaying the release of his forthcoming ninth studio album, Yandhi.  The album was originally slated for release on at the end of September but was delayed following the rapper's controversial appearance on Saturday Night Live.  Wait and see: Kanye announced on Monday that he would be delaying his Yandhi album a second time  Then, Kim took to Twitter to tell fans they could expect Yandhi on November 23 but now it looks like the album will be in limbo for the time being.  'It felt so good being on the stage last night with my brother Cudi,' Yeezy wrote on social media Monday.  'After performing again, I realize the new album I’ve been working on isn’t ready yet. I’ll announce the release date once it’s done.'  He added: 'Thank you for understanding.'  Hard at work: Despite having to evacuate from their homes, the Kardashian's didn't seem to miss a day of work  On top of Ye's professional woes, the family has been dealing with a deadly wildfire that has been blazing through the reality star's hometown which forced them to evacuate last week.  Her sister, 34-year-old Khloe Kardashian, actually donned a protective face mask following the evacuation to head out and deliver supplies to local fire fighters.  Despite the upheaval, the family hasn't seemed to miss a beat when it comes to their workload.  The stunning sisters got glam on Sunday for the People's Choice Awards to accept the trophy for Reality Show of 2018.  New look: Kim's been busy promoting her new KKW Beauty collection on social media  'Our hearts are broken from the horrific shootings and those who lost their lives and homes' from 'the devastating fires that are currently burning,' Kim said from the stage.  The mogul has also been hard at work promoting the upcoming holiday collection of her KKW Beauty line.  Kim's latest collection drops on November 23 and she's been flooding her social media accounts with glamorous images of the new smokey hues.  Fans can pick up the Glam Bible Smokey Volume I collection for $150 as the E! revealed in the caption of a snap of the set	1

"Kristin Cavallari. Photo: Courtesy  We all buy clothes, but no two people shop the same. It can be a social experience, and a deeply personal one; at times, it can be impulsive and entertaining, at others, purpose-driven, a chore. Where do you shop? When do you shop? How do you decide what you need, how much to spend and what's ""you""? These are some of the questions we're putting to prominent figures in our column ""How I Shop.""  Everyone's favorite drama (""drama, drama, dramaaa"") queen, Kristin Cavallari, is back on TV. It's been over a decade since she slowly walked out of an infinity pool and into our lives on ""Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County,"" and made the bossest of boss moves by being the only one to wear white to Lauren Conrad's ""Black and White Affair"" party. (And who can forget when she, again, stole L.C.'s thunder on spin-off ""The Hills"" by surprise-sauntering into Speidi's wedding in 2009?)  This time around, Cavallari moves into another life via reality TV fishbowl, set not in Southern California, but her new home of Nashville, Tenn. ""Very Cavallari"" showcases the titular star's home life, with NFL quarterback husband Jay Cutler and her three kids, and professional responsibilities running Uncommon James, her recently launched jewelry and lifestyle line, opening its flagship store and overseeing a team of TV-ready staffers at the company HQ. Cavallari has been stacking her fashion resumé since ""The Hills"" by curating a NFL-themed runway show at New York Fashion Week, designing her eponymous shoe line in collaboration with Chinese Laundry, commenting on red carpet fashion for E! and, of course, launching Uncommon James.  ""I design everything that I love and want to wear,"" she tells Fashionista over the phone from Nashville. ""It's a great representation of my style because everything is effortless and dainty and simple.""  Since ""Very Cavallari"" is largely set in a retail and fashion environment, we took the opportunity of its launch to ask the reality show star, designer and entrepreneur about her shopping habits, from her teen years to today. So read on to learn about her first big splurge as a reality star, when she knows a look in her closet is officially ""dunzo"" (sorry, couldn't help it) and how her DGAF attitude toward fashion dates back to her ""Laguna Beach"" days. Cue up the Hilary Duff song and prepare for some on-brand Cavallari one-liners.  Stephen ""Steph-EEEN"" Colletti, Cavallari and Talan ""ta-LAN"" Torriero at a Bongo Jeans at Kohl's Orange County store appearance in 2006. Photo: David Livingston/Getty Images  ""On 'Laguna Beach' — I mean I was 17 — so I didn't care [laughs]. I didn't even know what fashion was. I just wore what everyone in Laguna Beach was wearing and what I liked. I mean I wore jeans first with Ugg boots and I thought that was the coolest thing ever. What was so great about season one of 'Laguna Beach' was none of us knew what we were getting into and so we didn't care. Or I know I didn't care about about my outfits or my hair and my makeup. I was just living my life. I've never been a huge fan of putting a lot of time in everyday to get ready. I really enjoy it when it's once in awhile, but everyday I find it's just exhausting. So I've just always been that way: I care, but not that much.  It's funny in the sense that now people ask 'go back and comment on your outfits from 10 years ago' and it's like, 'oh god.' Of course, they're all awful! It's just the evolution of everybody and what I wore, let's say, when I was 18, was probably cool at that point. But now, of course, looking back, I cringe. There's always going to be that element of, 'let's go back in time and can you comment on this picture,' which most people don't have to do. I don't mind it necessarily. I'm just living my life, and so I'm not really reading blogs and reading comments about what people think about my outfits, so it doesn't affect me one way or the other, really.  I'd say [I found my personal style] in the last"	1
While Angelina Jolie brought her six kids with her to Cambodia in Feb. to promote her new Netflix film, it turns out they were never far away from their dad Brad Pitt! The former couple is finally playing nice for the sake of the children and he flew to Asia to help take care of their brood while she was busy working. “Brad was missing his children like crazy and Angie has actually been much more agreeable with him lately. So Angelina OK’d Brad’s trip overseas to spend some time with them while she was busy with other obligations in Cambodia,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  “Brad picked an obscure resort, in a foreign country, which helped protect his anonymity. He was able to play freely with his children in and around the resort, at the pool, without ever having his privacy being invaded by others. The kids and Brad were all very relieved and happy to be able to spend quality time together, out in the open, without drawing a ton of attention like the would in the states,” our insider adds.  It worked out perfectly as Angie, 41, was able to spend time promoting her latest directorial effort First They Killed My Father while meeting with Cambodian dignitaries. Her children did make a big public appearance with her at the film’s premiere, but then she continued on with her press responsibilities. It’s so great to know that the kids weren’t sitting at a hotel with nannies but instead were at a resort under the loving care of their father, having a blast!  HollywoodLifers, are you glad that Brad and Angelina have finally put the needs of their kids first in their bitter divorce?	0

"""Beijing 2022"" redirects here. For the Winter Paralympics, see 2022 Winter Paralympics  The 2022 Winter Olympics, officially known as the XXIV Olympic Winter Games (French: Les XXIVes Jeux olympiques d'hiver;[1] Chinese: 第二十四届冬季奥林匹克运动会; pinyin: Dì Èrshísì Jiè Dōngjì Àolínpǐkè Yùndònghuì), and commonly known as Beijing 2022, is an international winter multi-sport event that is scheduled to take place from 4 to 22 February 2022, in Beijing and towns in the neighboring Hebei province, China.[2]  Beijing was elected as the host city in July 2015 at the 128th IOC Session in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. These Games will be the first Winter Olympics ever to be held in China, the fourth Winter Olympics held in East Asia, and the last of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo, Japan. With its previous hosting of the 2008 Summer Olympics, Beijing will be the first city to have hosted both the Summer and Winter Olympics: there are plans to utilize many of the same venues that were used for the 2008 Games, including its indoor venues, and Beijing National Stadium (also known as the Bird's Nest) as ceremonies venue. Beijing is also the second national capital to host the Winter Olympics, after Oslo, Norway in 1952.  Bidding [ edit ]  The bidding calendar was announced by the IOC in October 2012, with the application deadline set for 14 November 2013. The IOC Executive Board reviewed the bids from all applicant cities on 7 July 2014, and selected three cities, Oslo (Norway), Almaty (Kazakhstan) and Beijing (China) as the final candidates.  Several cities withdrew their applications during the bidding process, citing the high costs or the lack of local support for hosting the Games.[3] Oslo, which had been considered the clear frontrunner, withdrew after its application to the Norwegian parliament for funding of the Olympics was rejected. Public reception to the application for funding had been highly negative due to cost concerns after the cost overruns of the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, and especially revelations about a series of hospitality-related demands that had been reportedly made by the IOC. The demands notably included ""diva-like demands for luxury treatment"" for the IOC members themselves, such as special lanes on all roads only to be used by IOC members and a cocktail reception at the Royal Palace with drinks paid for by the royal family. Several commentators pointed out that such demands were unheard of in a western democracy; Slate described the IOC as a ""notoriously ridiculous organization run by grifters and hereditary aristocrats.""[4][5][6][7]  Beijing was selected as host city of the 2022 Winter Olympics after beating Almaty by four votes on 31 July 2015 at the 128th IOC Session in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia.  2022 Winter Olympics bidding results City Nation Votes Beijing 44 Almaty 40  Venues [ edit ]  Location of the three Beijing 2022 clusters  Beijing National Stadium  In urban area of Beijing, five ice events will be held at the Olympic Green, the Capital Indoor Stadium and the Beijing Wukesong Sports Center, which were some of the main venues of the 2008 Summer Olympics.

Did you feel like something was missing from the 2017 Golden Globes? If so, you're not alone.  Many have noticed that the In Memoriam segment was left out of this year's show, which typically pays tribute to those stars we've lost in the past year.  While the Golden Globes honored Debbie Reynolds and Carrie Fisher with a special tribute video, they were the only two Hollywood icons mentioned during the telecast.  So what's the deal?  Don't worry, the Golden Globes didn't forget about the segment, they actually have an In Memoriam slideshow on their website.	0

Today is for you 🙏🏼✨ — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) May 30, 2018  But people on Twitter just couldn't believe that this was actually happening.  If you would’ve told me five years ago Donald Trump would be POTUS and Kim Kardashian would be in the Oval Office discussing prison reform with him I would have called you insane.    We truly live in the darkest timeline. — Denizcan James (@MrFilmkritik) May 30, 2018  “So, here’s the pitch. It’s a fish out of water story but get this, he’s the president and we have Donald Trump play him. And then, here’s the kicker we have Kim Kardashian play his sassy but still incompetent Chief of staff. It’s like Veep meets The Purge.” pic.twitter.com/3EO9V87vAL — Molly Jong-Fast (@MollyJongFast) May 30, 2018  I present the 10th circle of Dante's Inferno— Donald Trump meeting with Kim Kardashian about prison reform. pic.twitter.com/rjUseCYQvL — Dani Bostick (@danibostick) May 30, 2018  This book by @richardhine was published in June 2016 https://t.co/ebyLPgViWC — Daniel Radosh (@danielradosh) May 30, 2018  Apparently prison reform hits home for Kushner, who has firsthand experience with an incarcerated family member after his father Charles was charged with tax evasion, illegal campaign contributions, and witness tampering. Charles Kushner was jailed from 2005 to 2006.  The young Kushner even carried a wallet that his father made for him while serving prison time for his white collar crimes.  Since the experience, Kushner has vowed to make prison reform a key issue as a senior White House adviser, according to Vanity Fair. He's lobbied for the First Step Act, a bipartisan bill that helps inmates transition back into society more smoothly with job training and drug treatment programs. The bill, which passed the House last week, also gives inmates with nonviolent charges the chance to finish their sentences in halfway houses and house arrest. It's also seen its fair share of criticism.  Kardashian has been scrutinized for defending her husband Kanye West after his controversial tweets supporting Trump and far-right figures. But prison reform is something that she's been vocal about in the past; on Monday, she tweeted her support for Matthew Charles, a former inmate who turned his life around after 21 years of incarceration. Charles is required to serve another 10 years because his original release was a clerical error.  This man is sentenced to 35 yrs for selling drugs. He serves over 21 yrs, is released, finds a job, new relationship, starts a 	0

Or so this year’s Cannes Film Festival would suggest, with a protest held by 82 women gifting the event with the most cinematic of freeze-frame moments. Staged just six months after allegations surrounding Harvey Weinstein shocked the world, the headlines from this year’s showcase are about the power of women and their pursuit of equality.  This in mind, the one-way conversation I might normally have in this column about who wore which gown by which designer seems as limiting as it is discourteous. But if you’ll excuse my insolence I’d like to do so, because in watching Cannes from afar, it’s clear that something extraordinary is happening. The ball gown is no longer a prerequisite. At least it has been knocked down a peg or two, with more and more attendees choosing to shun tradition in favour of clothes that confirm and reflect a modern new age for the festival.  Take a glance at the relaxed trouser suits and the statement sweaters, worn (gasp!) with a pair of flat pumps instead of towering stilettos, and it’s clear to see: there is change afoot on the French Riviera.  It is from those choosing to buck the tried and tested trends of Cannes that a best-dressed list which is unlike any other in the festival’s history emerges. Among the leading figures are Léa Seydoux — an actress who represents a vibrant new generation of female film-makers — who favoured cocktail style sweaters and thigh-skimming Louis Vuitton shirt dresses instead of conforming to classic Cannes tradition.  She is joined by Kristen Stewart, who packed an array of Chanel trouser suits to accompany her on her trip to the French Coast, and by Carey Mulligan, who marched to her own tune in a scarlet tuxedo.  Saturday night’s protest serves as the most glorious example of Cannes’ prevalent new image, with women from across the length and breadth of the film industry choosing to take to the red carpet in everything from shift dresses and trouser suits to their favourite pair of jeans. The result was a spectacle which unearthed these women at their most powerful and a key change for the festival which counts gowns and honking great diamonds as crucial to its DNA as the Palme D’Or.  Of course Cannes is Cannes and accordingly there were gowns aplenty on the Le Croisette this year, with puffy and princessy giving way to moody shades and strong silhouettes.  When jury president Cate Blanchett made her impassioned speech on Saturday she did so in a streamlined creation by Giorgio Armani. It was a fitting complement for a woman who would have looked statuesque had she decided on a bin bag to wear to the occasion.  Stepping out in show stopping Givenchy, Julianne Moore made a similar impact. Cut with pin-sharp precision and laden with feathers, here was a dress that made no apologies for Moore’s pre-eminence. It was empowering — and completely fabulous.  In 2018, a year in which battles for flexible working and equal pay are as pertinent as they have ever been, the descent of princess dressing on Cannes’s red carpet makes for refreshing viewing. After all, while a couture gown laden with 20kg of diamonds might be one woman’s fairy tale, for many — for most — it’s not a practical choice.

"NORRISTOWN, Pa. -- The judge in Bill Cosby's sexual assault trial declared a mistrial Saturday after jurors said they were deadlocked after five days of deliberations.  The jury informed Judge Steven T. O'Neill it was ""deadlocked on all counts"" in a note Saturday morning. O'Neill asked jurors if they were ""hopeless[ly] deadlocked,"" and each stood and agreed they were, CBS News' Vidya Singh reports.  O'Neill called the jury's effort ""one of the more courageous acts, one of the more selfless acts that I've seen in the justice system.""  ""I feel bad for all of you. I really do,"" he said.  Cosby remains free on bail.  Montgomery County District Attorney Kevin Steele said he will immediately retry the case.  ""We will evaluate and review our case. We will take a hard look at everything involved, and then we will retry it,"" Steele said at a press conference Saturday morning. ""As I said in court, our plan is to move this case forward as soon as possible.""  A courtroom sketch shows Cosby in court on Saturday, June 17, 2017. Jane Rosenberg  Andrea Constand, who accused Cosby of sexual assault, smiled and hugged supporters in the courtroom. Constand embraced many of the alleged victims who sat through the trial.  Gloria Allred, an attorney for many Cosby's accusers, said she will continue to pursue legal action.  ""We can never underestimate the blinding power of celebrity,"" Allred said. ""But justice will come... It's too early to celebrate, Mr. Cosby.""  Cosby's defense team declared victory and went on the attack, with spokesman Andrew Wyatt saying that ""Cosby's power is back.""  Cosby's wife, Camille Cosby, slammed prosecutors for bringing the case to court. She issued a statement calling Steele ""heinously and exploitively ambitious."" She also attacked the judge, the accuser's lawyers and the media.  The fast-moving case went to the jury of seven men and five women Monday, on day six of the trial, after closing arguments painted different pictures of what happened between Cosby and Constand at his suburban Philadelphia estate in 2004. But the sequestered jury failed to reach a verdict, pausing a half-dozen times to revisit key evidence, including Cosby's decade-old admissions that he fondled Constand after giving her pills.  Late Thursday morning, the panel announced they were deadlocked, but the judge sent them back to work.  Cosby was charged with three counts of aggravated indecent assault, each one punishable by up to 10 years behind bars.  The black comedian once known as America's Dad for his portrayal of kindly Dr. Cliff Huxtable on ""The Cosby Show"" suggested recently that race could have played a role in the case against him. The jury included two black members.  Cosby used his power and fame to violate Constand, an employee of Temple University's basketball program, Assistant District Attorney Kristen Feden said in her opening statement. Constand, 44, testified last week that Cosby gave her three blue pills and then penetrated her with his fingers against her will as she lay paralyzed and half-conscious. She denied they had a romantic relationship and said she had rebuffed previous advances from him.  Cosby accuser stands by her story  ""In my head, I was trying to get my hands to move or my legs to move, but I was frozen,"" Constand, 44, testified June 6. ""I wasn't able to fight in any way.""  She added: ""I wanted it to stop.""  Defense lawyer Brian McMonagle, however, attacked what he said were inconsistencies in Constand's story, disputed that Constand was incapacitated, and made the case that she and Cosby, who was married, had a romantic relationship. McMonagle said Cosby gave her the cold and allergy medicine Benadryl only after she complained she couldn't sleep.  Constand sued Cosby after prosecutors in 2005 declined to press charges. Cosby testified over a decade ago as part of that lawsuit, eventually settling with her for an undisclosed sum. Cosby didn't testify at the six-day trial. But jurors still heard plenty from him a"	1
"(CNN) ""Black Panther"" star Chadwick Boseman gave his award for playing a superhero to a real hero.  The actor was accepting the MTV Movie & TV Award for best hero in a movie when he invited James Shaw Jr. to the stage. Shaw is responsible for stopping the gunman in a deadly shooting at a Waffle House in Tennessee in April that killed four people.  ""Receiving an award for playing a superhero is amazing, but it's even greater to acknowledge the heroes that we have in real life,"" Boseman said. ""So I just want to acknowledge somebody that's here today. James Shaw Jr. Where are you? Stand. If you don't know James Shaw Jr., he fought off a gunman in Antioch, Tennessee at a Waffle House.

"Image copyright Roc Nation Image caption Jay-Z receives his platinum award from the RIAA  Jay-Z's latest album, 4:44, has been certified platinum less than a week after it was released - reflecting sales of one million copies in the US.  On the face of it, this is hugely impressive. In the space of just five days, Jay-Z has landed the sixth biggest-selling album of the year.  His first-week sales are now expected to double those of Kendrick Lamar's Damn! - previously the year's fastest-selling album - which shifted 603,000 copies back in April.  The feat looks even more impressive because 4:44 is only available on Tidal, the streaming service Jay-Z owns.  But then Variety magazine noticed something odd: The photograph of Jay-Z receiving his platinum award was taken before the album was released.  Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Jay-Z's new song Bam is made Radio 1's ""hottest record""  How could the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) be so sure he'd pass the sales barrier?  Well, it turns out that Jay-Z had done a deal with mobile company Sprint (a major shareholder in Tidal), who gave away copies of the album to their subscribers.  Crucially, Sprint paid for each of those copies, making every ""free"" album eligible for a platinum award; and the RIAA says Jay-Z's label RocNation had to provide evidence that the downloads were in fact initiated by consumers.  But still - the RIAA rules state that the wholesale price of the album only needs to be $2 (£1.55) to register as a sale - so Sprint probably paid Jay-Z less than it would cost to air an advert during the Super Bowl (up to $3.8 million for 30 seconds).  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption 4:44 sees Jay-Z respond to Beyonce's accusations of infidelity on her album Lemonade  It's almost certain that these downloads are what spurred Jay-Z's album to platinum status. To do it on streaming alone, the album's tracks would have had to be streamed 1.5 billion times, since 1,500 streams of a song count as one ""sale"" under current chart rules.  Given that Tidal has, at best, 3 million subscribers, each of them would have needed to listen to the album 500 times to push sales over the one million mark - an impossibility in just five days.  The album's performance in the UK - where the album is only available on Tidal - is instructive here. On Monday afternoon, when the Official Charts Company publishes its midweek sales flash, 4:44 hadn't been streamed enough times to make the Top 100.  (In the US, the free-but-paid-for downloads aren't chart eligible, so Jay-Z won't make a huge impact on the Billboard countdown, either).  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Tidal was launched by an all-star line-up in 2015, promising better returns to artists - but it has struggled to compete with Apple and Spotify  So why go through this rigmarole? Well, the benefit to Jay-Z, in marketing terms, is huge. Music executives believe that gold and platinum awards have a bandwagon effect, leading to even-bigger sales.  And the RIAA has been accused of massaging the figures that count towards their awards before.  In 1994, for example, the music industry body claimed that the Lion King soundtrack had sold 7 million copies. SoundScan, which compiles the charts, contested the actual figure was 4.9 million. It turned out the RIAA had counted records that had been shipped to stores, but were still sitting on shelves and in warehouses (it also counts music distributed by non-retail record clubs, mail order houses, specialty stores and direct marketing sales).  So while you should take Jay-Z's figures with a pinch of marketing salt, it's also worth noting that 4:44 has been illegally downloaded almost a million times this week.  Fans are still eager to hear it, no matter how they're getting the music.  Follow us on Facebook, on Twitter @BBCNewsEnts, or on Instagram at bbcnewsents.

Kanye West was shocked and beyond angry he didn’t make ‘Forbes’ list of the top 5 most financially successful rappers, HollywoodLife has EXCLUSIVELY learned! Yeezy reportedly already has a plan to ‘crush’ the competition!  Kanye West has reportedly been fuming because he didn’t crack Forbes‘ top five most financially successful rappers in the world. “Kanye wants to be the GOAT of everything. Rap! Fashion! Producer! Endorsement deals! Everything,” a source EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife. The 39 year-old has reportedly decided that going off the grid could be the key to topping the list next year. “He got wind of the news that he wasn’t even close to making Forbes Richest Top 5 Artist and that inspired him to get out of town and go to a place where he could be alone and write  killer bars!,” the insider told us.  Yeezy reportedly had a rough time seeing some of the names on the list. “‘Ye loves everybody on that list but doesn’t think everyone should be there, mainly Drake, 30,” the source said. Yikes! “He’s happy for Jay Z, 47, but deep down he competes with HOVA on everything and that royally crushed his spirits when he learned Jay made it but he didn’t,” the insider told us. Could Kanye has still been upset over how long it took Jay Z to visit his family after Kim Kardashian’s robbery.  Don’t worry, Kanye fans because the rapper reportedly plans to come back better than ever. “‘Ye’s coming with it though,” the insider continued, “he’s on a mission to crush all these rappers and wants everyone to watch the throne because he’s coming for it.” Sean Diddy Combs, 47, topped the list this year with a whomping net worth of $820 million. Jay-Z came in second place just $10 million shy of Diddy with $810 million. Dr. Dre, 52, and then Birdman, 48, came in third and fourth with Drake and his 490 million rounded out the top 5.

"Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie: Could they go to trial over the kids?  Wrap it up.  That’s what image experts would say to Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, the once-golden couple now edging into explosive Hollywood divorce territory occupied by the likes of Woody Allen and Mia Farrow.  Today, ""most celebrities keep their divorces private, they settle them quickly usually with a press release,” says Christopher Melcher, partner of the California firm Walzer Melcher family law. “We rarely see this kind of nastiness that's happened recently.”  Brangelina is now shorthand for textbook anti-conscious uncoupling. Still, resolution – especially when six children are involved – is a thorny endeavor. So could this all end with a messy public spectacle?  After a summer of freshly boiled acrimony, the fractured family is back in Los Angeles, and the couple has seemingly recommitted to a previously agreed-upon temporary custody agreement. A scheduled hearing in family court on Aug. 21 was postponed. Pitt is seeing the children regularly.  Jolie “continues to support the reconciliation of the children with Brad and everything she does is focused on healing her family,” a source close to Jolie, who was not authorized to speak publicly, tells USA TODAY.  But what a road to get to this point.  A messy summer  In June, their divorce made headlines again when the couple's private judge threatened Jolie, saying if the actress doesn't start encouraging her children to forge relationships with her ex, she could be in danger of losing custody.  The judge further ordered Jolie to arrange a phone call with the kids and their doctors to explain to the children that “the court has determined that each of them are safe with their father.”  “What I imagine is difficult for Angelina is, how can somebody else override a parent’s decision? How can a judge tell her as a mom what’s best for her children? That’s the consequence on not agreeing with the other parent and submitting it to a judge,” says Melcher.  The lawyer adds: ""Maybe she knows something nobody else does, but the judge did not agree with her. And ultimately, the judge makes these decisions.""  More: The highest-paid actresses in the world: Johansson, Jolie, Aniston  And so it got uglier. With both stars asserting they wanted to move forward in dissolving their marriage (a process known as bifurcation), Jolie’s new lawyer, Samantha Bley DeJean, accused Pitt of not having paid “meaningful"" child support in court documents.  As the news went viral, Pitt’s lawyers quickly countered, detailing an $8 million housing loan plus $1.3 million in child care paid since their split. Pitt's lawyer, Lance Spiegel, called the legal maneuvering ""a thinly veiled effort to manipulate media coverage.""  But Jolie's lawyer doubled down, indicating that not only was Pitt charging the mother of his children interest on her new home, but he was also not paying half their expenses.  Image-wise, all of this matters: In the past two years, Jolie’s negative Q score, the industry's most commonly used measure of likability, has gone up four points. Pitt's negative score has remained static.  “Whatever’s been happening in the media, he’s been dealing with it better, based on the data,” says Henry Schafer, executive vice president of Q Score. ""It looks like based on consumer reaction that he’s weathering the storm much better than she is.”  The downfall of Brangelina  The uber-private, A-list couple married in 2014 after a decade of globe-trotting and children together, but the facade shattered in September 2016, when Jolie filed for divorce citing the ""health of her family"" after a private plane ride in which Pitt was alleged to have had a physical altercation with their eldest child, Maddox, who is now 17.  In the months that followed, each staffed up with power lawyers and various advisers. Allegations flew in the media and legal documents were leaked from family court. Pitt, who was cleared of child abuse allegations, confessed "	1

"© AP Image: Nicole Kidman, Keith Urban  Boy, is Keith Urban loved!  And that's exactly what the country star's wife, Nicole Kidman, told him in a sweet 51st birthday message Friday on Instagram.  The Oscar winner, also 51, shared a photo of herself giving her hubby a hug and kiss as they pose next to a gooey chocolate birthday cake from Rotier's Restaurant in Nashville.  ""You're so loved Keith Lionel. Happy birthday baby!"" Kidman gushed in the caption, adding the hashtag #keithsfavouritecake along with emojis of happy balloons, hearts, and, naturally, a cake with candles.  Kidman's ""Big Little Lies"" co-star Reese Witherspoon hopped into the comments to send her own sweet wishes to Urban.  ""Happy happy birthday KU! Sending you (love)!"" wrote Witherspoon.  Heartwarming displays of love between Kidman and her hubby are hardly unusual. After all, just months ago Urban encouraged the crowd at the Country USA Festival in Oshkosh, Wisconsin, to sing ""Happy Birthday"" to Kidman along with him.  Kidman, who wasn't at the concert, saw the sweet serenade on video — and then proudly shared it with fans. ""What a gift,"" she wrote.  What a gift indeed!  For more on Nicole, watch below:"	1

"On Wednesday, it was business as usual on **Howard Stern’**s Sirius XM radio show: Two celebrity guests, followed by two news-making celebrity reveals. His first guest, Jason Alexander, began casually reminiscing about his Seinfeld days—like he’s done many, many times before—but he ended up setting the record straight on a serious Seinfeld fan theory and revealed why they killed off George Costanza’s fiancée, Susan.  Fans will recall that Susan (Heidi Swedberg) died rather unceremoniously while licking “inexpensive envelopes” for their wedding invitations. Alexander explained that the reason for her sudden departure came down to the actors’ chemistry.  ""The actress is this wonderful girl. I love her,"" Alexander told Stern, but explained that, like his Seinfeld character, he didn’t know how to play off of her. ""We could do the most horrible things to her,"" Alexander said, ""but the audience was still on my side."" Alexander then recalled how the rest of the cast shared his sentiment. ""Julia [Louis-Dreyfus] said, 'Don't you wanna just kill her?' And Larry [David] went 'Ka-bang!' ""  Stern’s second guest was Jada Pinkett Smith, who also gave an extremely candid interview. The actress’s marriage to Will Smith has been tabloid fodder for years, and when she visited Stern, the talk show host asked Smith to clarify her previous comments about the pair being in an open relationship."	1
"If recent reports are to believe, Hollywood power couple George and Amal Clooney are planning to spend over a million dollars for the delivery of their twins!  Earlier this year, it was confirmed that George and Amal were expecting twins, which British tabloids reported to be a boy and a girl. George wants to make sure the twins enter the world in the most royal manner possible.  According to entertainment portal Aceshowbiz.com, the Hollywood star has rented out the entire Kensington Wing at London's Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, which essentially comes down to $580,000 for a week's stay. Amal is also apparently flying in two 'birth companions' from Los Angeles for around $30,000. George also wants Amal to be completely relaxed during the birth, which is why he hired an Italian masseuse for the hotshot lawyer for $5,000.  The couple is already known to be pretty generous with their money. Amidst reports that they might spend a million dollars on their nursery, George and Amal reportedly gave their neighbours a £45,000 compensation package for the noise caused by the renovations to their estate recently. The package was said to include a holiday to Corfu, a six-week stay in a luxury hotel and a £30,000 lump sum. In addition, the Clooneys paid for their neighbours to rent a £780,000 cottage.  Recently, George was advised on raising twins by Prince Albert of Monaco, who has twins himself. He said ""George should pour himself a good cup of coffee each morning."" He also added that he'd better get ""some sleep stored away before the babies are born""."	0
"After more than a decade, actor Billy Bob Thornton shared what led to his divorce from actress Angelina Jolie in 2003.  Thornton has married six times, but his relationship with Jolie—who is 20 years younger than the Goliath actor—was among his most notable. Jolie was Thornton's fifth wife. The former spouses met on the set of Pushing Tin in 1999. At the time, he was engaged to Big Little Lies star Laura Dern. Thornton and Jolie tied the knot in 2000, but they separated three years later.  ""I remember our time together as really being great,"" Thornton, 62, said on The HFPA in Conversation podcast Wednesday. ""We just had different lifestyles. Hers is a global lifestyle, and mine is an agoraphobic lifestyle, so that's really—that's the only reason we're probably not still together maybe, because of a different path in life we wanted to take.""  Thornton said he's maintained a friendship with Jolie since their divorce. ""Angie is still a friend of mine, and she's a great person, and she's done so much,"" he told The HFPA. ""She makes movies that are important to her whether they succeed or fail, she still does what she believes in, and I'll always respect her for that.""  When Thornton and Jolie were together, they were known for their seemingly eccentric ways. They had an immediate attraction, which ultimately led Thornton to allegedly part ways with live-in fiancée Dern without warning.  Dern learned of Jolie and Thornton's relationship after receiving calls from tabloids.  ""I left our home to work on a movie, and while I was away, my boyfriend got married, and I've never heard from him again,"" Dern said in Talk magazine 2000. ""It's like a sudden death. For no one has there been any closure or clarity.""  See all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows  Jolie notably had Thornton's name tattooed along her arm, and they both wore a vial of each other's blood around their necks. The former pair announced their plans to adopt a child—Maddox Jolie-Pitt—from Cambodia together in March 2002, but it was later disclosed that Jolie adopted her eldest kid as a single parent.  Since parting ways, the Bad Santa actor married puppeteer Connie Angland in 2014. Jolie is in the midst of a custody battle with former spouse Brad Pitt.  Representatives for Jolie did not immediately return Newsweek's request for comment regarding Thornton's remarks.  Kevin Winter/Getty Images"	1

Bella Hadid. Photo: Courtesy of Dior  Cleopatra’s bold eyeliner, Marilyn Monroe’s beauty mark, Pennywise’s entire face: If you like makeup, Halloween gives you a lot to work with. Every costume can be upgraded with a good makeup look, and some consist almost entirely of face paint. Enter condiment-enthusiast Bella Hadid, who puts on some makeup in this spooky, old-fashioned Halloween-inspired film from Dior.  The short film uses every classic scary-movie trope: creaky doors and cawing crows, ominous organ music and flickering lights, and old-fashioned title cards that spell out the products Hadid is using. We see her dramatically apply red lipstick, swipe on red blush, and then appear in a dream-like sequence with some funky geometric eyeliner shapes. There’s a point where she’s wearing a hooded cloak and looking into a mirror but get this: her face is also obscured by a mirror … spooky, Bella! The overall effect of the film is fairly haunting, and Hadid ends up looking like a really glam vampire. A glampire, if you will.  If your idea of costume makeup is wearing any makeup at all, this might be the look for you. Check out the video below and decide for yourself if you want to go as spooky glampire Bella Hadid for Halloween.	1

Brad Pitt has his eyes set on Margot Robbie, according to a new report! The two have allegedly been flirting like crazy on set of their new film, although Margot is a married woman! — So, what’s really going on here?  Work hard, play hard! Brad Pitt, 54, and Margot Robbie, 28, have reportedly been flirting it up on the set of their forthcoming film, Once a Time in Hollywood. “It’s obvious that Brad’s completely smitten with Margot,” a source tells Life & Style magazine. Their upcoming film also stars Leonardo DiCaprio, 43, who’s even reportedly noticed the close camaraderie between Brad and Margot. Leo “has called him out for layering it on so thick [with Margot],” the insider adds. — While this is adorable and all, nothing about this alleged relationship has been confirmed.  And, let’s not forget that Margot is a married woman. She tied the knot with her longtime boyfriend, Tom Ackerley, a film director, back in December 2016. She and Ackerley had a low key, secretive wedding on a beach in Australia’s Byron Bay, according to reports, where she wore an Oscar de la Renta gown. After much speculation, Margot finally confirmed she had said, “I do,” with an Instagram post (on December 19, 2016) from her wedding day. The actress posted a photo of her diamond ring as she and Ackerley shared a sweet kiss outdoors.  Since Brad knows all of this, he’s reportedly been nothing but professional and respectful of Margot’s marriage. “Brad insists he knows she’s off limits,” the insider tells the mag, adding that Brad is “just awed by Margot’s talent.” And, we can’t blame him about that! The source also notes that Brad, who’s always been a fan of Margot’s work, helped the actress land her role in The Big Short.  Brad’s been a single man since late 2016, after he and actress Angelina Jolie, 43, called it quits in September of that year. The two went through a nasty and very public divorce and custody battle, until they decided to have the court docs sealed for the sake of their children’s privacy. After many months of their lawyers going back and forth, a recent report claimed Brad and Angie reached a temporary custody agreement in early June 2018 that would allegedly last the summer. A judge reportedly ruled that five of their six children — Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 9, must have a good relationship and spend time with both parents. Maddox, 16, their oldest child, on the other hand, is allegedly able to go with either parent of his choosing because of his older age.  Now, the exes are on better terms these days and getting along as they live their new normal of co-parenting their children. While there’s been reports of Brad and Angie dating other people, nothing has been confirmed.	0

"I always just like to improvise, and that goes for my audition tapes as well. I kind of play around with it, have fun with it. Obviously in the audition tape, you can see that I'm holding my iPhone because I'm playing music as I'm going, and it's kind of a bit like a theater piece for me sometimes. I'll just speak and dance and go crazy and, you know, turn the music up as the audition tape goes on, and just leave the camera rolling.  What did the Duffer brothers say about the audition tape?  [laughs] I love it because they're so casual. I sent off the tape at 11 o'clock that night, Australian time. And then in the morning we had a response saying, the Duffers want to Skype you on Sunday. They were kind of like, ""Hey man. So we saw your tape, and, you know, it caused a bit of a stir at Netflix."" Apparently it was played in the big board meeting.  So tell me about your choice to use Duran Duran's ""Hungry Like the Wolf"" and Dexy's Midnight Runners' ""Come On Eileen"" in the tape.  So the season takes place in Hawkins in 1984 in October, so if I was going to be using any music in this thing, it couldn't have come out after that time. I wanted to not just go, Okay, it's the '80s, and just pick two big tracks from the '80s. It had to be before October of 1984, so I went and looked up the songs. [""Hungry Like the Wolf"" and ""Come on Eileen"" both came out in 1982.]  ""I was thinking: Either I'm never going to work again, or somebody somewhere is going to see one thing in me, and they'll give me a chance.""  I was at the premiere [of Stranger Things 2, in L.A.], five or six days ago, and the director of photography Tim Ives and the costume designer Kim Wilcox are working on a film together in Vancouver. They had close friends that are daughters or something like that to Duran Duran, and Duran Duran found out about this tape. And they're sending me a mystery present to my house in Perth! It's amazing!  No way. What do you think it is?  I have no idea. I'm wondering. It might just be a G-string. From their era. A used G-string. As a joke.  I have to ask. What inspired the G-string?  I did a play in high school, and that's the only reason I had this nude-colored G-string [laughs]. I think Billy's kind of unpredictable nature, it's not like me. It's obviously not like me to get in a G-string and do that, so I was like, what wouldn't Dacre do? And when I heard the music, I was like, well, whatever. YOLO [laughs]. Because I think that's Billy in every way. I get so self-conscious, so it was a nice reprieve from that, to be able to do that at home, during the day, while none of my family was home, and just go for it, to just have that moment of freedom, and be able to show them that I can have that uninhibited freedom. And I was like, Okay, what better way to do that than to oil myself up, put on a G-string, and... yeah.  Did you oil yourself up?  Yes, there might have been a bit of oiling that went on.  Did your parents see the tape?  [sheepishly] Yep. They saw it... Look, it was an interesting evening, but I think all was rectified when I got the call the next morning.  I remember sending it to my representatives in the States, and they forwarded it on to Netflix and the casting director, and I was thinking: Either I'm never going to work again, or somebody somewhere is going to see one thing in me, and they'll give me a chance.  But I'm glad it was done, and I stick by it. Like aside from the G-string, aside from the fun kind of gimmick that that is, I do care about it, and that's the way that audition tape was constructed. And I have done that for other projects since.  So for auditions going forward, this is a model you'll be emulating?  So I got an opportunity to audition for Justin Kurzel's next movie, which is set in Australia. So I drew the main [film] character's family tree and a map of the place where he comes from all over my arms and my chest, just all over my body with permanent marker. Justin could have very easily said, this is ri"	1
"9 / 0  Brad Pitt accused of child abuse following an altercation with 15-year-old Maddox    The most plausible cause for the Jolie-Pitt marriage break-down is also the saddest. New reports suggest an altercation between Brad and his 15-year-old son Maddox while Pitt was intoxicated on a 12-hour flight on the family's private jet caused the split. Pitt has since been investigated by the FBI for child abuse (as the altercation happened while the family were in the air) after an anonymous third party called child protection services once the flight landed.    Two members of the Jolie-Pitt staff spoke to The Sun about the incident, denying rumours that Pitt physically hit Maddox, but stating that the fight ""started on the way to the airport before the plane took off and escalated on the plane"". The incident happened on September 14th and Jolie cited the pair's separation date as being September 15th in her divorce paperwork. According to reports Brad has not seen the children since the incident, and is ""distraught and terrified."""	0
Among all of this season’s reboots, perhaps none engendered as much goodwill as the return of “Queer Eye.” The new Fab Five — Bobby Berk (interior design), Karamo Brown (culture), Tan France (style), Antoni Porowski (food), Jonathan Van Ness (grooming) — teamed up for a run of episodes that not only reflected their genuine camaraderie, but also brought a hefty dose of warmth, charm and authenticity to their makeovers.  How did you approach the update of “Queer Eye”?  Bobby Berk: One of the things we wanted to bring that the original show wasn’t able to was a look into our lives. Back in 2003, it was groundbreaking and controversial at the same time for gays to be on TV, but it was accepted because they kind of stayed in their lane. They were designers and hairdressers and cooks and it was kind of like “Oh that’s fine” but to be husbands and fathers — that wasn’t. One of the things we wanted people to know is that we’re just like other people. Karamo is a dad who gets texts from his kids saying, “Where’s dinner?” Just the fact that we’re just like everybody else is something we wanted people to see.  Karamo Brown: We wanted to have fun and show the brotherhood and love we have for each other. There’s one [episode] where we get playful and are throwing glitter on each other. The original show made you feel good and allowed you to have fun — that was very important for us to keep. At the end of the day with everything that’s going on in our world why not just take a moment to have fun with five people who are your friends.  Berk: In these days where every time you turn on your TV and you just get massively depressed or angry, we wanted to do TV that shows, “OK there’s going to be some hope for the world.” That is our biggest goal.  What was the most challenging aspect of taking on the makeovers of straight guys in Georgia?  Jonathan Van Ness: One thing for me that was challenging was just breaking through the idea of what a metrosexual was. I liked talking through that with men and making ideas of gender and grooming feel more approachable. It’s not a scary and taboo subject. We wanted to do transformations and makeovers for them that really make sense in the long-term. Not just for transformation’s sake, but something they’re going to be able to re-create. I grew up watching so many makeover shows and makeover [segments] on morning TV. I always thought, “Why would we put that haircut on that woman who says she has no time? So we give her a shag that requires all this styling?” So just things like that were fun to go do in a better way.  Tan France: The thing I found that was difficult was that it wasn’t a new show where I could immediately find my own voice. I felt pressure because this is a legacy show. It was a massive show. I am stepping into the shoes of someone who is iconic [Carson Kressley]. That was difficult for the first few days; I was trying to find my own way. I’m so not Carson, I’m very different. That was difficult to me. And all these cameras pointing at you — those first few weeks I really struggled.  In episode “Below Average Joe,” top left, Jonathan Van Ness, Karamo Brown and Tan France update the look and attitude of stand-up Joe Gallois, second from left; “To Gay or Not Too Gay” featured AJ Brown, who came out on the show in an very emotional episode.  Courtesy of Netflix  Antoni Porowski: I came from the background of scripted [acting] where I had those confines and found safety in it. What I found daunting was the length of our scenes. There’s no action, there’s no cut. But what I actually learned was the comfort in that you get to have real conversations with these people. You know there’s a camera there. But some of these scenes would last two hours and be cut down to something really small. I think it’s a reminder to continue doing that going forward. There’s comfort in the freedom of just going with it, enjoying those pauses and not feeling like you have to push it all the time.  France: The nice thing	1

"""Seeing her name in headlines again and again, as part of one person’s attempt to gain more attention for her personal cause, along with Harvey’s desperate attempt to vindicate himself, was devastating for her,"" the family said.  Veteran studio executive and producer Jill Messick died by suicide on Wednesday after battling depression for many years, her family tells The Hollywood Reporter.  Messick, who worked at Miramax as a production executive from 1997 to 2003, also served as Rose McGowan's manager in January 1997, which is when, McGowan has claimed, she was raped by Harvey Weinstein.  In a statement following her death, her family says Messick was ""victimized"" after becoming embroiled in the Weinstein-McGowan allegations. Her name made headlines when Weinstein's attorney, Ben Brafman, released an email on Jan. 30 attributed to Messick in defense of his client. Her family says now that Messick ""became collateral damage in an already horrific story.""  Messick's family's full Feb. 8 statement is below.  ""The Movement"" just lost one of its own.  Jill Messick was a mother of two children, a loving wife and partner, a dear friend to many and a smart entertainment executive. She was also a survivor, privately battling depression, which had been her nemesis for years.  Today she did not survive. Jill took her own life.  Jill was victimized by our new culture of unlimited information sharing and a willingness to accept statement as fact. The speed of disseminating information has carried mistruths about Jill as a person, which she was unable and unwilling to challenge. She became collateral damage in an already horrific story.  Jill believed in the Movement. She supported every woman finally coming forward to share their dark truths and expose those who had committed previously unspeakable deeds. She was loyal. She was strong. Jill was many things, but she was not a liar.  Over the past few months, many women have come out with allegations against Harvey Weinstein, including Rose McGowan, who has repeatedly spoken with the press, striking out against not only her alleged attacker, but a great many others. One of them was Jill, who chose to remain silent in the face of Rose's slanderous statements against her for fear of undermining the many individuals who came forward in truth. She opted not to add to the feeding frenzy, allowing her name and her reputation to be sullied despite having done nothing wrong. She never chose to be a public figure; that choice was taken away from her.  Now that Jill can no longer speak for herself, it's time to set the record straight.  In January 1997, Jill was an entry-level manager at Addis Wechsler. One of her first clients was Rose McGowan, and one of Jill's first duties was to set up a breakfast meeting with Harvey Weinstein during the Sundance Film Festival. Following the meeting, Rose told Jill what had happened — that she made the decision to remove her clothes and get in the hot tub with him — a mistake which Rose immediately regretted. Rose never once used the word rape in that conversation. Despite this, Jill recognized that Harvey had done something untoward to Rose, if not illegal. She immediately went to her bosses, the partners of Addis Wechsler, to recount Rose's story and to insist that they immediately address the situation. They told Jill that they would handle the situation. The ensuing arrangements between Rose and Harvey were then negotiated, completely without Jill's knowledge. At that time, all Jill knew was that the matter was settled and that Rose continued making films with the Weinsteins. She never knew any details until recently, when Rose elected to make them public.  Ten months later, in November of 1997, Jill received a call from the Miramax exec VP of production, recruiting her for a job as an executive at Miramax Films working in production in Los Angeles. Jill was hired based on merit and her excellent work of over two years as a young development executive working "	1
These are their stories… and they’re going to go on for at least another year: Law & Order: Special Victims Unit will return for Season 20, TVLine has learned.

"Reggaeton icon, Daddy Yankee, took to Instagram to share a rare photo that gave us insight to his private life. He shared a post of a private jet full of balloons and gorgeous flower arrangements to celebrate his 23rd wedding anniversary.  Most of us know the the 41-year old Despacito singer for his catchy tunes, so seeing him post something not related to his music is definitely a breath of fresh air. I mean look at how romantic he is....a jet filled with flowers and balloons? I would melt.  He and his wife Mireddys González married in 1994 and this is what Daddy Yankee had to say in honor of his wife: ""Porque un Jefe necesita de una buena Jefa. Con la bendición de Dios, Aniversario""  That translates into: ""Because every boss needs a good boss. With God's blessing, anniversary #23"""	1

Meghan Markle. Photo: Karwai Tang/WireImage  Meghan Markle currently has one of the most enviable wardrobes on the planet, but she’s always had impeccable taste, even before she was a royal. It was once immortalized on her lifestyle site, the Tig (rest in peace), and now it’s immortalized in thousands of photos, Instagrams, and blogs devoted to what the Duchess of Sussex wears on any given day.  And of course, everyone wants to shop like Meghan. We’ll be rounding up her best outfits and where to buy the exact pieces so you can build out your Duchess of Sussex wardrobe. All that’s left is the messy bun and royal title.  Meghan in London, England  Meghan will be the royal patron of four lucky charities, according to a recent announcement. She visited one of them, Smart Works, where she styled some women for job interviews. It’s all very exciting, but for a moment let’s focus on her shoes. The duchess, while doing the very royal act of becoming a patron of an organization, wore some very fun but non-royal shoes. Her cow-hide and Lucite heels are by Gianvito Rossi, and they are incredible.  Photo: Clodagh Kilcoyne/WPA Pool/Getty Images  Even better, she paired them with a relatively inexpensive (for a royal) dress from trendy maternity brand Hatch. It’s still available on Shopbop, FYI. She finished the outfit with a gorgeous Oscar de la Renta coat, which is as beautiful and bouncy as her sister-in-law’s hair. Get the look (or a facsimile) below.

Apparently, Meghan and her team of schoolchildren of Auckland defeated Harry and his team. Welly wanging is a sport where you try to throw a rainboot (Wellington boot) as far as possible. The royals frequently participate in Welly Wanging – Kate Middleton often does it in heels – and it’s always thoroughly enjoyable. Anyways, to play the game Meghan wore a pair of J. Crew jeans, a simple scoop neck t-shirt and a Karen Walker blazer with a pair of wellington boots. Business on top, serious sportsman on the bottom.

She arrived in Auckland in a mono-chromatic beige look. She wore a custom shift dress from American designer Brandon Maxwell, a trench coat by Burberry with Bishop sleeves, and Stuart Weitzman heels. She re-wore the heels later that night to a dinner with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern along with a navy-blue dress by Antonio Berardi. Sadly, those pieces are sold out, but shop her welly wanging look below.  From left: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry at a reception in Auckland.

Carrie Fisher had cocaine, methadone, heroin and ecstasy in her system when she died in December, according to an autopsy report released Monday.  The coroner’s report listed sleep apnea as the primary cause of death, with drug intake as a contributing factor. The report stated that Fisher’s family objected to a full autopsy, and coroner’s investigators had access to limited toxicology specimens. The conclusions were based on toxicology results and an external examination of Fisher’s body.  Fisher died on Dec. 27, four days after going into cardiac arrest on an airplane arriving at LAX from London. The report states that Fisher’s assistant was on the plane with her. The assistant reported that she was awake and normal at the beginning of the flight, but had “multiple apneic episodes, which was her baseline” during the flight. At the end of the flight, she could not be awoken.  “Based on the available toxicological information, we cannot establish the significance of the multiple substances that were detected in Ms. Fisher’s blood and tissue, with regard to the cause of death,” the report states.  According to the report, Fisher may have ingested the cocaine as early as three days before the flight, adding to the uncertainty about the cause of death. The report also notes a likely exposure to heroin, which could have suppressed her breathing as she went into cardiac arrest.  In addition to the illegal drugs, Fisher was also taking Prozac, Abilify and Lamictal under prescription. She was also taking oxycodone without a prescription.  The report also notes that Fisher had a history of bipolar disorder and a long history of drug use.  Carrie Fisher Autopsy Report by gmaddaus on Scribd	1
"Sure, we all love the glitz and glamour of red-carpet appearances, but these things are never as easy as they seem. In fact, several actresses have been candid over the years about challenges that go into awards-show season—namely, finding a designer who works outside of limited sample sizes, which are typically 0 through 4.  Most recently, Bebe Rexha shared that she's having trouble finding designers to dress her for the 2019 Grammy Awards. (She's nominated for Best New Artist and Best Country Duo/Group Performance.) ""I had my team hit out a lot of designers and a lot of them do not want to dress me because I’m too big,” she said in an Instagram video, clarifying that she's a size 8.  In December, Megan Mullally took to Instagram to share that she couldn't find a designer to dress her for the Screen Actor’s Guild Awards in January—even though she was going to be hosting the entire thing. “Looks like I will be buying my dress online though, as per my usual, even though there is literally a 100 percent chance that I will be on camera, because I’M HOSTING IT,” she wrote in an Instagram post in December. “Designers do not send me dresses.”  A Wrinkle in Time director Ava DuVernay also spoke out about not finding designers to dress her in a tweet on December 23. ""I’m a director, not an actress. Not a Size 0. I like to stay covered. Stylists weren’t inspired,"" she tweeted.  They're not alone: Stars like Leslie Jones, Tiffany Haddish, and Rachel Bloom have found themselves in the same boat and have had to purchase their own red-carpet gowns (we're talking $$$, of course) to put together their looks. Below, here are 18 times celebrities got real about the red carpet."	1

"The royal baby wait continues, but Meghan Markle and Prince Harry have already been making post-birth plans. First, news emerged that the couple wants to launch a royal tour in Africa with their child, and perhaps even pay a visit to the U.S. and Canada. Now, sources are saying that they also want to look into buying a place in California so that their child has a connection to Markle's home state.  A source told The Sun that finding a place to spend time in Los Angeles is definitely on the Duke and Duchess of Sussex's to-do list sometime in the future. “Meghan definitely wants a place in Los Angeles—she loves the city, the lifestyle and climate. Ultimately, she is a California girl and can breathe easier there,"" the source said. ""Spending time there would also allow her some freedom and independence from both the palace and the press—and more control over her life and the people around her.""  Plus, it helps that Markle's mother, Doria Ragland—who arrived in London to spend time with her daughter and future grandson not too long ago—still lives in California. The two have always been close, and speculation has existed for a while now that Markle and Prince Harry pay her secret visits.  “Meghan is very close to her mother and will want to be able to share quality time with her in her hometown,"" another source told The Sun. “She also has friends in L.A. with babies and will want to have that interaction and bring up her child in a less restrictive environment—similar to how she grew up.”"	1
Disney will end its distribution deal with Netflix and launch its own streaming service, the company announced today. It intends to launch the service in 2019.  The move is a real blow to Netflix, which secured a valuable streaming deal with Disney back in 2012 — before streaming had really taken off. The deal only kicked into effect last year, so Netflix is barely seeing any benefit here.  At the same time, it’s a natural step for Disney, which has a huge library of valuable movies and shows to offer. Disney already makes it hard to get a lot of its top movies — requiring people to purchase, rather than rent, a film for instance — so it makes sense that we’re seeing the company try to draw even bigger profits from streaming.  Netflix won’t lose its Disney movies right away. Disney says it plans to cut Netflix off starting with the studio’s 2019 films, and Netflix says it’ll be able to keep all the Disney movies it gets through the end of that year. That means Netflix should be able to stream the next two Star Wars movies, but it’ll miss out on the new trilogy’s final installment. “We continue to do business with the Walt Disney Company on many fronts, including our ongoing deal with Marvel TV,” said a spokesperson for Netflix.  Disney is buying most of BAMTech and will also launch an ESPN streaming service  Disney’s streaming service will be built off technology from BAMTech, the MLB-founded video streaming platform. Disney was already a major investor in BAMTech, and today it’s making an even bigger investment — of $1.58 billion — giving it a 75 percent stake in the company. The acquisition still requires regulatory approval.  “This acquisition and the launch of our direct-to-consumer services mark an entirely new growth strategy for the company, one that takes advantage of the incredible opportunity that changing technology provides us to leverage the strength of our great brands,” Disney CEO Bob Iger said in a statement accompanying the announcements.  The Disney-branded streaming service will be the “exclusive home in the US for subscription-video-on-demand viewing,” and will kick off with films including Toy Story 4 and the sequel to Frozen. “Original movies, TV shows, [and] short-form content” will be added to the service, and it’ll be filled out with older movies from Disney and Pixar’s catalog and shows from Disney’s TV channels.  In addition to creating a streaming service for Disney movies and TV shows, the company will also launch a streaming service exclusively for ESPN, targeted for a launch early next year. Disney is promising about “10,000 live regional, national, and international games and events a year,” with individual sports packages available as well. Disney plans to sell both of its subscription services directly to consumers.  ESPN has increasingly been a point of concern for Disney. The channel is expensive, which has led consumers and cable providers to look for ways to drop it from their package or otherwise cut costs. Being able to sell it straight to consumers lets Disney tap into the market of cord cutters who have been missing out on sporting events, while potentially increasing the amount of money it makes per subscriber.  The loss of Disney films will be a major disappointment for Netflix subscribers and will certainly make it harder for Netflix to find new ones. But it’s something that Netflix seems to have been prepared for. The streaming service has reinvented itself over the past several years to become a home for original shows and movies, and this move from Disney both underscores the urgency of that and how correct a move it was.  Just this week, Netflix announced the acquisition of a comic book publisher that’s already seen several successful film adaptations; in light of today’s announcement, it’s easy to see why Netflix would want to lock down even more original properties for itself.  As for Disney, it’s hard to imagine its movie and TV streaming service not being a success. If it’s 	1
"Ben Higgins still hasn't recovered from his breakup with Lauren Bushnell.  The Bachelor couple went their separate ways last May after a year and a half together, and by December, Higgins thought he was up to find love again on The Bachelor Winter Games. But as Tuesday's episode of The Bachelor spinoff showed, the 29-year-old reality star wasn't ready for romance.  ""To try to engage in relationships here, and know that the last time I did this, it was one of the best moments of my life... my fear is not entering into a relationship. My fear is not pursuing somebody. My fear is that if I were to be broken again, I'm not full enough right now to recover from that,"" Higgins cried in a heart-to-heart with Chris Harrison before packing his bags and heading home.  Months after filming ended, Higgins has no regrets about leaving the show early, telling ET's Lauren Zima at the Winter Games World: Tells All taping last week that ""it was the right time"" for him to go.  ""I was sitting on the couch and all the couples were making out around me at different places around the living room, and I was like, 'Yeah, I don't think it's my time here anymore.' Like, Yuki and I had too many snowball fights and it's time for me to go,"" he confessed. ""I feel really good about that decision.""  And despite letting the tears flow during his emotional conversation with Harrison, Higgins said the moment didn't come ""from hurt.""  ""There's moments in this experience that really transcend even reality. There's moments that all of a sudden you're like, 'I haven't been able to express this or communicate this in a year and now I'm doing it on a television show. What in the heck happened?'"" Higgins explained. ""These shows kind of put you in this environment where you really have to dig deep and you have to talk about relationships and love. You start to realize things you never knew you felt, and my emotion was coming from this.""  ""As soon as [Bushnell and I] broke up, I was getting questions,"" he said, revealing that he read comments from fans asking if he really loved Bushnell, or expressing their wishes that he would have chosen someone else in his finale. ""I was finding myself either protecting Lauren, defending our relationship or having to respond to the fact that they love Lauren. I would say, 'Yeah, I did to. I do to.'""  Bushnell has since moved on with a new man, Devin Antin, but it's not her new relationship that's been hard for Higgins -- because the former Bachelor said he's still been focusing on his own relationship with her.  ""It broke me, because something that was really personal and really real and really hard was something that I also had to relive every day and still do to this day,"" he shared. ""There's not a day that goes by that Lauren isn't brought into my life, and as you're trying to heal from a breakup... it crushes you.""  Months earlier, Higgins told ET that he was ""excited"" to fall in love again, and felt ""more ready today than I did two years ago."" Watch below.  The finale of The Bachelor Winter Games airs Thursday at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC, with the World Tells All special airing right after.

Nearly a decade ago, the world was introduced to a group of unruly 20-somethings and the term “gym, tan, laundry.”  More than five years after “Jersey Shore” signed off the air, MTV is reuniting the group, who became worldwide household names as the reality show became a cultural phenomenon, drawing in nearly 9 million viewers per episode at its height.  Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi, Jennifer “JWoww” Farley, Mike “The Situation” Sorrentino, Paul “Pauly D” DelVecchio, Deena Nicole Cortese, Vinny Guadagnino, and Ronnie Ortiz-Magro are all back for “Jersey Shore Family Vacation,” the revival of “Jersey Shore” that will follow the escapades of the original cast on a month-long vacation in Miami Beach where they’ll all be living together in the same house, just like old times.  “They were all in a place where they had grown, they had been through so much individually and collectively, so they were in a place where they wanted to reunite,” Nina Diaz, head of unscripted for MTV and VH1, tells Variety of bringing the original cast together. The executive says ever since the series went off the air, the network had hopes to bring back “Jersey Shore” in one way or another. “It’s one of the greatest reality shows of all time and one of the most beloved casts, and for most of us, it ended way too soon,” Diaz adds.  Since “Jersey Shore” ended its run in 2012, MTV has given a spinoff to two of the stars with “Snooki & JWoww,” which ran for four seasons, and late last year, the network premiered an offshoot in “Floribama Shore,” which has already been renewed for a second season. Much has also changed since “Jersey Shore” went off the air — and the current political climate could actually serve the rowdy show in a positive way.  “The timing was exactly right now because of people wanting escapism and really identifying with this idea of taking the time out of your hectic and chaotic and demanding lives to go do something with your friends,” Diaz says, pointing out that audiences are craving an escape in the midst of intense newscasts and constant political headlines. “Viewers are looking for something that just reinforces the basic joys of life and family and friendship and the permission to let loose.”  Diaz also says the millennial MTV audience has grown up with the cast, and like the “Jersey Shore” players who are now married and have their own family, viewers’ lives have changed dramatically, but the desire to have fun is still present. “There are many viewers who are in their late 20s and 30s and juggling all these things, but still wanting to have strong relationships with friends and have experiences together and take a vacation and forget about it all.”  “Jersey Shore Family Reunion” has already been renewed for another season — which will not take place in Miami — and should audiences connect with the cast the same way they did the first time around, MTV is open to many more seasons.  “As long as the viewers are excited and invested in the ‘Jersey Shore’ cast journey, we’re there,” Diaz says.  Here, the cast of “Jersey Shore” talks to Variety about reuniting, what’s different, and what’s not.  What was your first reaction when you were approached to do another season of “Jersey Shore?”  Snooki: We told MTV we were ready to come back, and with the help of the fans, they brought us our family vacation. I was super excited to be coming back with the crew. Reality shows rarely get second chances, especially after six years, so we are all truly grateful to be having this experience.  JWoww: We were all really excited when we heard that MTV was bringing it back! We had a group chat saying how much we missed each other so we brought in the executive producer saying we wanted this more than anything and lets make it happen!  The Situation: I was not hesitant. I’m not sure I believed it was really happening. I had always hoped that they would do a reboot or another season, but it was all a dream.  Pauly D: I was excited, but actually didn’t belie	1

Coachella is the one festival we love more for its trend inspo than for its tunes, and no one dresses better for the occasion than the definition of #goals, Vanessa Hudgens. Whether it's her mermaid mane or her embellished threads, every year we eagerly await the moment she showcases her outfit game... and then cry into our sorry pile of flash tattoos and glitter. So, while you wait for this year's big reveal, here's a look at all the times she proved she was the queen of boho.  1. Case in point, these lit nails!  No outfit is complete without a magnificent mani, and this intricate nail art is pretty magnificent. Plus, they're a pretty good excuse for getting out of putting up that sh*tty ass tent. Lol.  2. When she went all kinds of sexy mermaid...  and dyed her tresses for days HOT pink. This is ombre done oh-so-right.  3. When she brought back the noughties coin waist belt (remember those?!)  and made it look nothing like before.  4. When she made the kaftan a field-side thang  Vanessa nailed this look. Loving those mirrored shades too!  5. When she outdid our poor attempt at experimenting with hair chalk  And looked ah-mazing, naturally.  6. Then there was the time she donned the pretty embellished bindi  Vanessa gets extra style points for matching her pink lippy to her hair AND rocking loose braids before they became a thing. Appaz she's pretty psychic as well as down right beautiful. Gee that woman's got it all.  7. When she went where many festival goers have been before, only we failed  Nothing says Coachella more than a floral crown, and heck, why not go full on matchy-matchy with turquoise tresses too? Always one step ahead that VH.  8. When she showed us she's got the most fashionable gal pals ever  What a good looking squad - Vanessa's gal pals are just as 'chella chic as she is. And you know what they say, friends that pose upside down together stay together...  9. And now for the time she told the story of Coachella...  Through a series of yoga poses, as you do. Namaste Nessy, namaste.  10. When she introduced us to another one of her many talents: Jewellery layering  It's all in the detail - crochet, coloured hair and she even matched her mani to her accessories.  11. When she did the whole shebang and it still wasn't too much  With her tousled long locks, jewelled head piece and striking printed dress, VH proves exactly why she's our Coachella queen.  12. The time she made us want to learn how to crochet  This look ticks all the festival fashion boxes in one: feathers, coin accessories and crochet. No wonder she looks so smug!  13. When she showed us that no festival is complete without glitter tats and floppy hats  AKA the perfect components to watch the sun set over another day in 'chella paradise, don'tcha know!  14. And the time she made suede and shade a thing  A suede jacket is the perfect cover up for chilly nights at 'chella, and it's just common knowledge that no festival wardrobe is complete without denim shorts. Glow sticks optional obvs.  15. When her nails upstaged every outfit we've ever owned  Her embellished 2016 set will go down in history as the mani of our dreams. FACT.  16. When she went matchy matchy with her sissy and gave us sibling goals  We're feeling those seventies vibes ladies. *runs to Hobbycraft to purchase peacock feathers in bulk.*  17. When she made crochet and dungarees a thing  How come we never look this good in our dunga's, aye?  18. Or how about that time she donned cliche festival chic but still made it work?  Anyone else would look out of place in a kaftan and flowers in their hair, but not our girl Nessy.  19. Or when she partied with Emily Ratajkowski and it was everything  Two of our biggest girl crushes together in one photo. *sigh*  ​Vanessa we salute you.

"Lisa Marie Presley net worth: Lisa Marie Presley is an American actress and singer who has a net worth of -$16 million. Lisa Marie Presley is probably most famous for being the daughter of Elvis Presley. Lisa has released three studio albums during her career, two of which achieved gold status. She released her third studio album called Storm & Grace, in May of 2012. It features a bluesy and soulful brand of roots rock which many music critics said was perfect for Presley's talents as a singer and as a songwriter. Outside of the recording studio, Lisa Marie curated an exhibit in honor of her famous father at Graceland. The exhibit, entitled ""Elvis…Through His Daughter's Eyes"" contains over 200 items related to the King of Rock and Roll collected by Lisa Marie over the course of her life. She has also received accolades for her work in philanthropy, particularly in service of her hometown of Memphis, Tennessee, which is famous as the birthplace of the careers of many rock and roll legends.  Elvis Presley's estate: Lisa was 9 years old when her father died. After years of over-spending and financial mismanagement, the estate was worth just $5 million at the time ($14 million today) of his death. Elvis left joint control of the estate to Lisa, her grandfather Vernon and her great-grandmother Minnie Mae. Vernon died in 1979, and Minnie Mae died a year later. At that point, 12-year-old Lisa became the sole heir of the Elvis estate and trust fund. At the time, the estate was estimated to be worth $100 million, roughly $295 million in today's dollars. According the terms of the trust, Lisa officially inherited her father's estate in 1993, on the day of her 25th birthday. In February 2005, Lisa sold 85% of Elvis' image, licensing rights and operational rights of Graceland to intellectual property company Core Media Group, for $100 million. The deal paid her $53 million in cash and absolved $25 million worth of debt that had been incurred by the estate. She also received $20 million worth of equity in Core Media Group (which at the time was called CKX Inc.). To this day Lisa maintains 100% ownership of Graceland itself including the 13 acres of grounds and her father's personal items.  Lisa Marie Financial Problems: In November 2017, Lisa filed a lawsuit against her former business manager for allegedly squandering $100 million of her fortune and leaving her broke. The lawsuit accused that the business manager of ""reckless and negligent mismanagement and self-serving ambition"". Lisa claimed that in May 2016, her trust which used to be worth well over $100 million, was worth just $14,000 and had $500,000 in credit card debt. The business manager claimed it was Lisa Marie who spent herself into debt. He claimed that her extreme spending habits actually put her estate $20 million in debt in 2003, which he corrected.  In February of 2018, as part of her divorce from Michael Lockwood, Lisa filed legal paperwork that showed she is $16 million in debt. $10 million of the debt is related to unpaid taxes dating from 2012 to 2015. The rest of the debt is credit card bills and unpaid attorney's fees. Lisa filed the paperwork after her ex demanded $450,000 to cover his legal fees."	1

Michael Bublé and his wife, Luisana Lopilato, are expecting their third child, Us Weekly can confirm.  The singer’s rep confirmed the good news and according to reports in Lopilato’s native Argentina, the actress, 30, is about two and a half months along in her pregnancy.  The happy news comes after a heartbreaking year that saw the couple’s eldest son, Noah, 4, battle cancer. He was diagnosed with liver cancer in November 2016 and the singer, 42, and his wife put their careers on hold while their little boy underwent treatment. (The pair also share a second son, Elias, 2.)  A source told Us in December 2017 that Noah is “doing well” now and “Michael is ready to think about going back to work.”  But the source added that the couple’s focus remains on their family. “This difficult time has brought them closer together and put things in perspective,” the source said. “Michael is keeping his workload light so he can spend as much time as possible” with his wife and sons.  The “Feeling Good” singer gave an update about Noah’s condition to Us last February. “We are so grateful to report that our son Noah has been progressing well during his treatment and the doctors are very optimistic about the future for our little boy,” Bublé told Us at the time. “He has been brave throughout and we continue to be inspired by his courage.”  Lopilato opened up about Noah’s health and the impact it had on their family in an interview on Argentinian TV last July.  “These things, when they happen to you in life, they make you realize that the most important thing isn’t what you thought it was — it’s to have faith, to be strong,” she told TV host Susana Giminez. “There were nights I couldn’t sleep, that I prayed to God, because it’s a long process. But thank God the worst is over.”	1

"Whatever you did this weekend, you should have gone to the Sunset Tower Hotel in Hollywood, where apparently the two hottest young stars of the season, Oscar nominee Timothée Chalamet and pop star Selena Gomez , were both hanging out.  According to E! News , ""Chalamet arrived around 9:30 p.m. with a male pal and had dinner. Gomez walked in with a few girlfriends about two hours later. Chalamet chatted with her on the phone before she arrived and the two found each other inside. They sat next to each other at a table and appeared to enjoy a friendly chat over drinks. Gomez had a martini, while Chalamet was seen with a Jack and Coke.""  The two met and became friends last year while filming A Rainy Day In New York , in which they play a romantic couple. It's been speculated that the film, written and directed by Woody Allen, may not get much by way of a theatrical release, since public sentiment has largely turned on the alleged child molester and confirmed daughter-marrier. The sporadic Timothée-and-Selena sighting may be as close as we get to seeing the film.  Since completing production, Chalamet has publicly disavowed the project, announcing on Instagram that he would be donating his salary to charity.  Loading View on Instagram  Gomez has addressed the Woody Allen issue less directly, telling Billboard that she auditioned for the roject multiple times and that the allegations were ""something, yes, I had to face and discuss. I stepped back and thought, 'Wow, the universe works in interesting ways.'"" On an Instagram Live, they described the film as a ""romantic comedy"" and also chatted about their mutual love of hip-hop.  Now, a romantic comedy about a young dramatic actor stealing a the most followed girl on Instagram away from her Canadian bad boy-turned-super-Christian boyfriend, on the other hand, would definitely get a wide release.

Dakota Johnson, the 28-year-old daughter of actors Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson, has been dating Chris Martin, 40, the lead singer of Coldplay, and an anonymous source told US Weekly that Gwyneth approves.  “She trusts his judgment and knows he’s smart about his decisions and who he spends time with,” the source told the publication. “She leaves it at that. She doesn’t scrutinize his choices or who he dates.” The source revealed that Chris has not introduced Dakota to Moses and Apple, his kids with Gwyneth.  The GOOP mogul considers Chris and Brad part of her ""modern family,"" and recently photographed the two men together at brunch. Soon, we might see a table of four or even a party of six."	1

"After the horror film opened to astounding numbers at the box office, Corden evoked fear as the co-worker from hell in a spoof on his late-night show.  James Corden parodied John Krasinski and Emily Blunt's horror film, A Quiet Place, during a Wednesday night sketch on The Late Late Show. In A Quiet Late Late, Corden plays an annoying co-worker who will barge in on group activities if he hears the slightest sound.  ""If he hears you, he will join you,"" the trailer warns. Indeed, when Corden hears the sound of a Late Late Show employee biting into a chip in the breakroom, he joins his colleagues for lunch, much to their dismay. Not only does Corden steal their fries, but he incites major eye rolls when he gleefully shows off his new fidget-spinner.  Later, things get a bit more intense when his co-workers play a silent game of Monopoly — directly referencing a scene from A Quiet Place — and an employee can't help but cheer out loud when he wins the game. ""Maybe he didn't hear,"" another player whispers in fear, just before Corden pops up out of nowhere.  ""You guys playing Monopoly? I love Monopoly!"" he says, completely unaware of how unwanted his presence is. ""I'll be the thimble. You guys here the whole time? I didn't even hear you.""  At the end of the clip, a co-worker's phone rings and it only takes seconds before Corden finds him. That's when the employee discovers Corden's weakness: physical exertion. ""He will force you to include him,"" states the trailer. ""Unless you run away.""  After a short sprint, Corden gives up, saying, ""I'll catch up with you later. We had fun! That's a fun game.""  Corden's take on A Quiet Place comes after the movie made more than $50 million over the weekend. In the film, which has earned rave reviews, Krasinski and his wife, Blunt, play a couple who live in isolation with their two children. In order to avoid being killed by spider-like monsters who are acutely attracted to sound, they make a concerted attempt to never make any noise.  The project marks Krasinski’s first screenplay and his third directorial effort since he and Blunt got married in 2010. The Paramount Pictures feature was recently cleared by China's censors and secured a release date (May 18), which is rare for a horror film in the communist country."	1

""She really made an impact.”  The actor/comedian, on-hand to promote his audio book ""A Polaroid Guy in a Snapchat World"" and his movie ""Father of the Year"" dropping on Netflix July 20, recalled how a run-in with Kate would motivate his companions to dress to the nines.  “It’s funny ‘cause every girl I was with, or anyone that knew they would see Katie, would dress differently. They would bring their A-game,"" he said. ""It was very sweet.  ""They would be like, ‘Is Katie coming? Are Andy and Katie gonna be there?’"" he continued. ""And if they were, it was a whole new wardrobe.""  Spade said Kate, being ""very sweet"" and knowing his friends had dressed to impress, would compliment them.  ""And when I’d say, ‘You don’t dress up for me,’ they’d go, ‘Yeah, that’s her and you’re you,'"" joked Spade.  Noting he could just ""start bawling,"" Spade said of his sister-in-law: “She was such a beautiful, lovely, great spirit that obviously will be missed.”  Kate was found dead in her New York City apartment last month of an apparent suicide, Det.

"Jamie Dornan (L) and Dakota Johnson attend the Los Angeles premiere of ""Fifty Shades Darker"" on February 2, 2017. File Photo by Jim Ruymen/UPI | License Photo  Feb. 6 (UPI) -- Jamie Dornan says he's ""getting too old"" for the Fifty Shades films.  The 35-year-old British actor confirmed on Monday's episode of Lorraine that the third Fifty Shades movie, Fifty Shades Freed, will mark his final appearance as Christian Grey. The films co-star Dakota Johnson, who plays Anastasia Steele.  ""Dakota and I are, particularly me, I'm getting too old for this,"" Dornan told host Lorraine Kelly.  The Fifty Shades movies -- Fifty Shades of Grey, Fifty Shades Darker and Fifty Shades Freed -- are based on the E.L. James erotic book trilogy. James also wrote two novels from Christian's perspective that have yet to be adapted.  ""Erica wrote the first two books again from Christian's perspective, but I guess we've already seen, sort of done those films, the same stories, so they won't do that again,"" Dornan said of the prospect.  Fifty Shades Freed opens in theaters Friday. Dornan said in an interview with The Ellen DeGeneres Show in January that the film will have a different feel than Fifty Shades of Grey and Fifty Shades Darker.  ""Obviously, there's still sex in it. There's people who want to see sex, it seems, so we kept a fair amount [in the film],"" the actor said. ""But, there's definitely a thriller aspect to this one.""  ""There's really fun car chases, and someone gets kidnapped,"" he shared. ""There's a lot happening this time."""	1

"Megastar Barbra Streisand and popular actor James Brolin first met on the set of Capricorn One in 1970, a film in which her first husband Elliot Gould also starred. Barbra Streisand and Elliot Gould had a son named Jason in 1967. Jason appeared in the film The Prince of Tides as Barbra's onscreen son. Streisand and Brolin married in 1998 in the intimate setting of Streisand's Maibu, California living room in the presence of 105 guests, including the likes of John Travolta and wife Kellly Preston, record producer Quincy Jones and Streisand's 89-year-old mother. ""We wanted to be surrounded by people we've loved for a long time,"" says Streisand. Born Barbara Joan Streisand (Barbara 'with' the second 'a'), Streisand made the decision early in her career to drop the second 'a' from her name so that 'Barbra' would have a more original spelling, rather than change her name. Though she became a huge movie star and singing legend, Streisand had to be convinced that she was a truly gifted singer, as her initial ambition was to be an actress who sang rather than being known for her signing. Born Craig Kenneth Bruderlin, James Brolin was widely known for his role as Dr/ Steven Kiley on the 1969-1976 television series Marcus Welby, M.D. James Brolin is the father of actor Josh Brolin."	1

It's boring, but, you know, we respected each other enough that it was as painless as it could be. It was heartbreaking only in a sense that the friendship would not be the same, as far as just the day to day.'  The Maniac star went on: 'But the friendship is shifting and changing, you know, so that part is something that we're both very proud of.'	1

"Turns out Victoria Beckham wasn't pissed off at the royal wedding... She was relieved  If you didn't watch the royal wedding over the weekend, here's what you missed.  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle got married.  Reverend Michael Curry was a shining star and also the breath of fresh air we all needed and craved so much.  Prince Phillip looked very old and confused.  And Victoria Beckham didn't smile.  That last occurance, as we all know, is nothing new.  For years now, VB has taken it upon herself not to smile whenever she's out and about. It happens often enough, we're all used to it.  And according to Victoria, it's because the fashion industry has ""stolen"" her smile and that she doesn't crack one out out of respect to the industry.  Advertisement  Fair.  This weekend though, Victoria wasn't lamenting the fact that fashion had stolen her ability to break out her pearly whites.  She was actually relieved... because she wasn't pregnant.  Probably our default state, to be honest.  Victoria told The Evening Standard she was delighted she wasn't expecting a child at this royal wedding, like she was back in 2011 when she attended Will and Kate's big day.  She said:  ""Quite honestly, it was such a relief not to be hugely pregnant at this royal wedding that it was a joy to be able to choose anything I wanted to wear.""  Advertisement  VB also recognised that her outfits from both weddings were similar enough, saying: ""I love navy.""  Fair, girl.  Same.  The fashion icon went on to say that the wedding was lovely and that she had a great day.  She said:  ""It was such a beautiful, incredible wedding. It was just the best day.

"After getting the chance to meet Pope Francis on Saturday, Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom shared a video of themselves cozying up inside the Roman Coliseum on Sunday.  ""Here I am once again at the Roman Colosseum,"" Perry said in a video, which was added to her Instagram stories. ""Just another metaphor for my life online.""  (Photo: Instagram/@katyperry)  PEOPLE reported on Sunday that the two are back to dating each other exclusively once again.  ""Orlando and Katy are great.

"""The Perfectionists"": Release Date, Cast, Plot, Trailer And Everything You Need To Know  By Katie Louise-Smith  Here's everything we know about the Pretty Little Liars spin-off, ""The Perfectionists"".  When Pretty Little Liars ended after 160 episodes on June 27, 2017, the fandom was heartbroken. How are we gonna live without knowing what happens to our favourite liars?! Thankfully, it was announced a few months later that a spin-off called The Perfectionists, adapted and produced by PLL show-runner I. Marlene King and based on the novel of the same name, would be making it's way to TV with Rosewood's very own Alison DiLaurentis and Mona Vanderwaal - and the fandom cannot wait.  The latest news? When it was announced that Sasha Pieterse would be reprising the role of Alison in the spin-off, many were left wondering why she moved across the country without fianceé Emily and the twins. King has now confirmed that we will find out why Allison moved away at some point during the first season. “You learn in the pilot why Alison is there, and what’s going on with her and Emily,” she shared with TVLine.  “We left her very happy with Emily and the twins, so to justify why she would leave that behind to come to Beacon Heights was worthy of much more conversation.”  A 10-episode season has been picked up by Freeform and the cast, including stars from Disney's The Descendants, Gossip Girl and The Walking Dead, has now been announced. Filming is due to begin in March and the show should be arriving on our screens at some point in 2019.  Freeform have also shared the first trailer for the series and you can watch it below:  When will The Perfectionists be released?  There is currently no official release date for The Perfectionists just yet but Sofia Carson confirmed in an interview that the show would be airing at some point in 2019.  In January, showrunner I. Marlene King revealed to ETOnline that ""the script is written and we're in the process of rewriting it just to fine tune it perfectly."" They were also reportedly scouting and locking down locations in the Pacific Northwest of the US, where the new town of Beacon Heights will be set. On February 27th, the cast attended their first table read with production due to begin the following week.  And so it begins... #plltheperfectionists A post shared by Sasha Pieterse (@sashapieterse27) onFeb 26, 2018 at 12:50pm PST  Where can I watch The Perfectionists?  The Perfectionists has now officially been picked up by Freeform for a 10-episode season so it will be available to watch on the same network as Pretty Little Liars.  Freeform  Who will be in the cast?  Sofia Carson (The Descendants) has been cast as Ava, a blogger and coder who strives to be a fashion icon and one of the series' main protagonists.

Sydney Park, who fans of The Walking Dead will know as Cyndie, will be playing the role of Caitlin. Caitlin is described as smart, driven and someone who thrives under pressure. She's the perfect daughter of two perfect mothers who has set her sights on following in her mother’s Senatorial footsteps.  Also joining the cast is Gossip Girl legend Kelly Rutherford (Lily Van Der Woodsen) as Claire Hotchkiss, the mother of the murdered Nolan Hotchkiss. She, along with her husband, founded Hotchkiss Industries and Beacon Heights University.

According to a press release, the women were inspired by the Time’s Up movement, an initiative launched by hundreds of Hollywood women to advocate better workplace conditions and the end of sexual harassment.  Emma Stone will be accompanied by Billie Jean King, the pro tennis player and activist that Stone portrays in “Battle of the Sexes.” In addition to founding the Women’s Sports Foundation and the Women’s Tennis Association, King has received the Presidential Medal of Freedom and is the founder of the Billie Jean King Leadership Initiative.

Ai-jen Poo, the director of the National Domestic Workers Alliance and co-director of the Caring Across Generations Campaign, will attend with Meryl Streep. Poo is listed as one of Fortune’s 50 World’s Greatest Leaders and is a 2014 MacArthur fellow.  Michelle Williams’ guest will be Tarana Burke, the founder of the #metoo movement and senior director at Girls for Gender Equity. Burke is a gender and racial justice advocate who was based in Selma, Ala. for over a decade, leading to a consulting position on Ava DuVernay’s Oscar-nominated “Selma.”  Mónica Ramírez, the co-founder of Alianza Nacional de Campesinas, will accompany Laura Dern.

Lawrence is a musician and vocalist who has spent recent time traveling the country in advocacy for Native Treaty Rights and the “Mni Wiconi” (Water is Life) movement led by the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe and the #NoLNG253” movement led by the Puyallup Tribe. She dedicates her artistry and energy to addressing racial injustice, police brutality, mass-incarceration, gentrification, violence against women and children, misrepresentation of Native Americans in education and mainstream media, climate injustice, blood quantum and enrollment issues, foster youth, suicide prevention, and many other causes.

However, this is one of the first times the effort has been coordinated among many attendees.	1

It's been nearly 20 years since Sisqo blew minds young and old with what in 1999 was one of the boldest pop songs ever written. It was simple, it was straightforward, it was scandalous. It was “The Thong Song,” and it was recently ranked by Billboard as having the 84th greatest chorus of the 21st Century.  Still, two decades of enduring greatness does not mean a refresher isn't in order. Fashions change, and so do the sounds of summer. Norwegian trio JCY is just the group to bring a little modern heat to a classic. The tropical house update was blessed by Sisqo himself with the track with fresh vocals.  It's just as beachy keen as the original -- and even better for your summer time pool party DJ sets. Drop this on the crowd and watch the ladies lose it.	1

Kim Kardashian West said she wants to give her daughter “a normal life” as the pair posed in a new photoshoot inspired by the style of former First Lady Jackie Kennedy.  The reality TV star said she was “very conscious” of her daughter’s mixed-race heritage after appearing with North, her daughter with rapper Kanye West, in the pictures for Interview Magazine.  The images were taken by photographer Steven Klein. It is the first time four-year-old North has appeared on the cover of a major magazine.  Kardashian, whose family have roots in Armenia, said: “Kanye always has his family around and people who look like my daughter — that’s important to me.  “She’s obsessed with her curly hair, and if she finds someone who has the same hair, she runs to them and is like, ‘You have curly hair like me?’ And we get to talk about it.  “We also talk about it with my niece Penelope, because she and North look really different, but they’re best friends and they’re together all the time.”  The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star said the family had “strict rules” about how much of the children’s lives are included in the reality show that made their name.  She said: “Some seasons they’re on a little bit, just to show a bit of personality, although there are never storylines about them. But then there’s social media, on which I’ve always been really open. When I’m out and people call North’s name, that’s when it’s weird for me. She lives such a normal life, believe it or not, at home.”  She shared the images on her Instagram page captioning it: “Interview Magazine September cover!!! This photo shoot I will cherish forever as such an amazing memory with my daughter, working with the most incredible team.”  Kardashian-West said the photographs were a “homage to the iconic Jackie Kennedy”.  But she was criticised on social media, with some people saying the pictures were an insult to the memory of the the former First Lady.  One person tweeted: “This is a disgrace, You are no Jackie O,” while another said: “Jackie O turning over in her damn grave right now.”  Some twitter users also wanted to know why Kardashian’s skin colour appeared to have been darkened to match that of her daughter.  “Why did they darken her skin to try and make her look black?” one asked.	1
"The possibility of Game of Thrones' Daenerys Targaryen and her late husband Khal Drogo sitting on the Iron Throne together may be impossible given what happened in the show's first season, but Emilia Clarke gave fans that image to savor when she and Jason Momoa, the actors behind the characters, reunited at a Game of Thrones cast party this weekend. Clarke and Momoa each posted shots of them posing by the Throne. They also got straight-up gushy about each other in their captions, as they have in the past.  ""FYI...This is the closest you’ll ever get to me attempting ‘that lift’ from dirty dancing,"" Clarke wrote on her Insta. ""Yes, my man is sitting. Yes, there’s no lake. And yes, I have no idea I’m NOT being raised above his head. (Id like to take a moment to thank alcohol for giving me courage to attempt this. Ever.)""  Momoa wrote the most adoring comment on her 'gram: ""Epic night love u my love enjoy every moment so proud of you.""  Instagram  He posted several shots of them too, writing, ""Moon of my life @emilia_clarke every time I leave you my face hurts from smiling to much. I Fucking love you forever. Aloha j""  Clarke liked the shot:  Instagram  Both Momoa and Clarke shared shots from the party of them with other cast members, hinting they may have been at the wrap party for the series. ""I’m so grateful to be apart of the greatest show on earth. I’m honored to be able to come to Ireland and celebrate with my friends. I’m just here for kisses and hugs and The black stuff 😜😜😜😜,"" Momoa wrote, perhaps to debunk rumors his character may be making a surprise last-season appearance. ""Mahalo David and Dan you are legends. Congrats to the talented crew and cast.""  Instagram  Clarke told Vanity Fair that she shot Daenerys' final scene earlier this year. ""It fucked me up,"" she said. ""Knowing that is going to be a lasting flavor in someone’s mouth of what Daenerys is... """	1
"Stop what you’re doing and gather round, because actress Sarah Hyland has something very important she wants to get off her chest. The Modern Family star has faced harsh criticism over her weight from a number of fans, with some even going as far to say that she’s suffering from anorexic. But enough is enough, with Sarah taking to Twitter to set the record straight…  ""I'd like to address something that has not only been brought up on Twitter but has been heavily discussed by all of you in my Instagram comments. That something is my weight,” she wrote on May 25. “I normally don't comment on things like this because it draws attention to those trying to spread negativity but I'm here to explain a few things and spread love.” Sarah, 26 – who has previously struggled with kidney dysplasia and needed a kidney transplant in 2012 – explained that she has been dealing with health issues, and that any weightloss can be put down to them.  And while she didn’t go into specifics, she did say that this past year hasn’t been “the greatest for her” and that it brought a lot of changes – physically and mentally. “I am not a fan of ‘being skinny,’ ” she continued. “‘Eat a burger,’ ‘Your head is bigger than your body and that’s disgusting’… And you’re right! No-one’s head should be bigger than their body but considering I’ve basically been on bed rest for the past few months, I’ve lost a lot of muscle mass."" ""My circumstances have put me in a place where I’m not in control of what my body looks like.”"	1

"Three's company! Jamie Foxx is jeopardizing his relationship with his longtime girlfriend, Katie Holmes, by texting his ex. The 50-year-old actor was all smiles as he met up with a beautiful brunette for lunch in LA on Feb.17 — but it wasn't Katie, with whom he'd just spent Valentine's Day. For the second time that week, the Oscar winner was hanging out with Kristin Grannis, the mother of his daughter Annalise. And according to witnesses, Jamie even brought her a gift: a black designer purse.  Now Katie is starting to suspect that they're more than just friendly exes. ""She recently found out about a string of texts Jamie sent to Kristin that included details of secret meetings — and him admitting he still loved her,"" an insider exclusively tells In Touch of the relationship, which has reportedly caused problems for the actor in the past. And after nearly five years of dating Jamie under the radar following her 2012 divorce from Tom Cruise, this latest betrayal is devastating to the 39-year-old actress. ""It's taken her years to trust Jamie enough to publicly be seen with him,"" the insider explains, ""and he showed a blatant lack of respect.""  (Photo Credit: Getty Images)  Jamie doesn't want to give up either woman. ""He insisted there was nothing more to the relationship than him and Kristin discussing their daughter,"" the insider says. Kristin was also spotted with the actor at a basketball game with friends on Feb. 11. To add insult to injury, the same day Jamie met up with Kristin, he was publicly dismissive of Katie. As he left a Feb. 17 event in Thousand Oaks, CA, he was caught on camera quipping, ""It's Black History Month... No white girls till March 1.""  Just one day earlier, Jamie made headlines when he walked away during an ESPN interview after he was asked about spending Valentine’s Day with Katie. ""Jamie could've handled the situation with much more dignity,"" the insider admits. ""Katie was totally dissed by him.""  Still, Jamie doesn't want to lose her. ""He’s desperately trying to make their relationship work. He’s planning a make-or-break luxury vacation for them and begging Katie to hear him out,” the insider adds. ""But it’s going to take a lot of hard work and e ort for Jamie to get back into Katie’s good graces, because his behavior is unforgivable.""

"Brad Pitt has reportedly apologised to his ex-wife Jennifer Aniston, more than a decade after their 2005 marriage break-up.  Brad Pitt has reportedly apologised to his ex-wife Jennifer Aniston, more than a decade after their 2005 marriage break-up.  According to US magazine In Touch, the actor (52) has offered an apology to his ex-wife for the way he treated her in the aftermath of their split.  Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston started dating in 1998, they married in 2000 and divorced five years later. (Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images)  The actor recently ended his marriage with his Mrs & Mrs Smith costar Angelina Jolie, with whom he has six children.  ""He's been determined to apologise for everything he put her through and that's exactly what he did. It was the most intimate conversation Brad and Jen have ever had.""  Actor Jennifer Aniston (L) and Justin Theroux attend Jason Bateman's star unveiling ceremony on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, on July 26, 2017, in Hollywood, California. / AFP PHOTO / VALERIE MACONVALERIE MACON/AFP/Getty Images  ""He apologised to Jen for being an absentee husband, for being stoned and bored. He also made amends for leaving her for Angelina,"" the source said.  Aniston wed actor and screenwriter Justin Theroux in 2015.  Actor Brad Pitt (L) and actress Angelina Jolie arrive at the 84th Annual Academy Awards held at the Hollywood & Highland Center on February 26, 2012 in Hollywood, California. (Photo by Jason Merritt/Getty Images)  Meanwhile, Pitt admitted earlier this year that he was “boozing too much” in the months before his split from Angelina Jolie, and has turned to therapy to help him through.  The Hollywood star also said he slept on the floor of a friend’s house for six weeks after his wife filed for divorce, because he could not bear to be in their family home.  In his first interview since the separation, Pitt told GQ Style he was a “professional” drinker, saying: “I can’t remember a day since I got out of college when I wasn’t boozing or had a spliff, or something … I mean, I stopped everything except boozing when I started my family.  ""But even this last year, you know – things I wasn’t dealing with. I was boozing too much. It’s just become a problem.  ""And I’m really happy, it’s been half a year now, which is bittersweet, but I’ve got my feelings in my fingertips again.""  He continued: ""I enjoy wine very, very much, but I just ran it to the ground. I had to step away for a minute. And truthfully I could drink a Russian under the table with his own vodka. I was a professional. I was good.""  Pitt, who has six children with Jolie, admitted that he had ""hit the lottery"" but let it go to waste, and is now finding comfort in therapy.  He said: ""I just started therapy. I love it, I love it. I went through two therapists to get to the right one.""  He added: ""For me this period has really been about looking at my weaknesses and failures and owning my side of the street. I’m an asshole when it comes to this need for justice … It’s such a silly idea, the idea that the world is fair.  ""And this is coming from a guy who hit the lottery, I’m well aware of that. I hit the lottery, and I still would waste my time on those hollow pursuits.""  After Angelina filed for divorce, Brad could not even bear to be in their house in the Hollywood Hills, saying: ""It was too sad to be here at first, so I went and stayed on a friend’s floor, a little bungalow in Santa Monica.  “I crashed over here a little bit, my friend (David) Fincher lives right here. He’s always going to have an open door for me, and I was doing a lot of stuff on the Westside, so I stayed at my friend’s house on the floor for a month and a half.”  When asked if the split was like grieving a death, Pitt replied: “Yeah,” before adding that it has made him want to be a better father.  He said: ""It’s hit me smack in the face with our divorce: I gotta be more. I gotta be more for them. I have to show them. And I haven’t been great at it.""  Pitt faced"	0

More drama in the seemingly infallible #FastFam: After news of Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham’s Fast & Furious spinoff broke this week, Tyrese Gibson took to Instagram yet again to vent his frustrations. “Diversity, love, multi ethnic worldwide multi generational, United Nations, One Race, Fast Family...... Until Dewayne showed up,” he wrote ominously, the latest in an ongoing feud between him and the former WWE champion.  “I tried to warn you guys,” he continued. “You thought I was hating...... I was simply fighting to keep the family together.” Doubtless Gibson is feeling more than a little aggrieved that Johnson is getting his own movie before the gang gets back together to film Fast & Furious 9, and this is not the first time he’s called his co-star out on social media for trying to make the franchise all about The Rock. The ninth movie has been delayed a full year to April 10, 2020, while Johnson and Statham’s spinoff, inspired by their delightful chemistry during The Fate of the Furious, is coming July 26, 2019. The spinoff news came only a day after the delay announcement, and Gibson smelled a rat.  In light of the news, Johnson simply tweeted, “My goal from day 1 was to come in and create an exciting/fun character for the fans, elevate the franchise and build it out. #HobbsShaw2019.” He didn’t address Gibson’s concerns directly, but, listen, the fans can tell.  Vin Diesel, the leader of the franchise and the man whom Johnson once referred to as a “candy ass,” has released a few cryptic social media posts, the first of which, on Friday, featured himself with Gibson and the late Paul Walker, and was simply titled “Brotherhood…”  Johnson is nowhere to be seen in the photo. Yikes.  But, since he always seems to be the peacemaker in these situations, Diesel posted another Instagram hours later of a screenshot of him and Johnson from Fast 5, the first in the franchise to introduce Johnson’s character Luke Hobbs. The delay of the ninth film is no one’s fault, he wrote, “However, like any vehicle that has run around the globe 8 times, the franchise is in need of maintenance.”  “We have some very exciting news to share soon... stay tuned,” he concluded. “Yours truly, Dom #FamilyAlways.” I’m not crying, there’s just some grease in my eye.	1

Chelsea Houska’s ex-boyfriend, Adam Lind, is a free man — for now. The Teen Mom 2 star has been released from jail after he was arrested for violating his probation.  As previously reported, Lind was taken to the Minnehaha County Jail in South Dakota for violating his no contact order in a domestic assault case, on Tuesday, December 5.  Radar Online reports that the 28-year-old MTV star was released on a personal recognizance bond.  “His bail was dropped because he agreed to show up at court for his next hearing,” the clerk reportedly explained to the publication.  Lind was arrested last month and his ex-girlfriend, Stasia Huber, filed and received an order of protection against him.  The reality star, who shares 8-year-old daughter Aubree with Houska, and 4-year-old daughter Paislee with ex-girlfriend Taylor Halbur, has had other run-ins with the law prior to this. He was arrested several times for driving under the influence and driving without a license. During the August 7 episode of Teen Mom 2, it was revealed Lind tested positive for methamphetamines.  Lind first appeared on MTV during the second season of 16 & Pregnant when Houska was pregnant with Aubree in 2010. Teen Mom 2 just wrapped its eighth season, and included a storyline where Houska wanted to change Aubree’s name to include her husband Cole DeBoer’s last name.  Houska moved on from Lind with DeBoe in August 2015. The pair welcomed son Watson in January 2017. According to Radar, Lind’s next court hearing is schedule for December 21 at 9 a.m.	1
Kim Kardashian West and Kylie Jenner might own beauty lines, but Kourtney Kardashian is the real beauty guru in the Kardashian-Jenner family. If you watch Keeping Up With The Kardashians or read Kourtney’s blog, you might have noticed just how passionate the reality star is about natural beauty.  Ahead, we take a look at some of Kourtney Kardashian’s beauty secrets for natural skin care, including what natural deodorant she uses and how she keeps her skin hydrated with manuka honey.  Kourtney Kardashian uses natural ingredients in her skin care regimen. | Chris Delmas/AFP/Getty Images Kourtney Kardashian uses natural ingredients in her skin care regimen. | Chris Delmas/AFP/Getty Images  Coconut oil  Superfood ingredients such as coconut oil have made their mark on natural skin care and beauty products. And, like many natural beauty devotees, Kourtney is no stranger to its beauty benefits. On top of using the natural oil in her hair, the reality star likes to moisturize her body with it, too. According to her app, Kourtney applies coconut oil to her body skin “right out of the shower” and let it sit for 10 minutes.  In addition, the reality star uses coconut oil in some homemade beauty recipes, too. One of Kourtney’s go-to’s? A DIY lip scrub made with coconut oil, manuka honey, and sugar. The natural concoction gently sloughs off dry skin and nourishes for a silky soft, smooth, lipstick-ready pout.  Manuka honey  Another all-natural ingredient Kourtney Kardashian swears by for skin care? Manuka honey. The reality star is a big fan of Manuka Doctor skin care products and also swears by the all-natural superfood honey for home skin treatments.  Thanks to its natural humectants and anti-aging properties, manuka honey can be used in beauty for many things. For soft, hydrated skin, more youthful-looking skin, apply manuka honey to the complexion as a face mask and let it sit for about 10 minutes before rinsing. You can also add it to homemade beauty product or as a spot treatment on pimples. In addition to being anti-aging and hydrating, manuka honey also boasts anti-bacterial properties that can help combat breakouts and keep the complexion clear.  good morning A post shared by Kourtney Kardashian (@kourtneykardash) on Oct 7, 2017 at 10:57am PDT  Natural deodorant  Like other celebrities and wellness aficionados, Kourtney no longer uses chemical-ridden deodorants and switched to a natural deodorant. “Changing over to an all-natural deodorant seemed like an important thing to do when I heard that when people are diagnosed with breast cancer, they are told to immediately discontinue using conventional antiperspirants and deodorants,” the reality star shared in a blog post. “Although research connecting the parabens and aluminum from these products directly with breast cancer is inconclusive, I like to play it safe,” she concluded.  So, what natural deodorant does Kourtney swear by? Schmidt’s Natural Ylang Ylang + Calendula deodorant. At $8.99 a pop, the natural deodorant is more affordable than other other natural brands. In addition, it features an award-winning formula made with essential oils and free of aluminum, parabens, propylene glycol, and phthalates.  Natural sunscreen  Deodorant isn’t the only natural skin product Kourtney likes to use. As a California native, the reality star knows how crucial it is to protect her skin from the sun. That said, like many of her products, she prefers a more natural formula. Her favorite natural sunscreen? Drunk Elephant Umbra Sheer Physical Daily Defense Broad Spectrum Sunscreen SPF 30.

"Just when you thought Fiona the baby hippo couldn't get any cuter, you catch her hanging out with both her parents for the first time in their pool at the Cincinnati Zoo, posing for a family portrait.  Fiona and her mom Bibi were joined by dad Henry in the outdoor habitat before the zoo opened to the public. According the zoo, the family encounter at Hippo Cove went swimmingly.  “The introduction lasted about an hour, and we couldn’t be more pleased with how it went,” said Christina Gorsuch, the zoo's curator of mammals. “Fiona has been exploring the outdoor habitat with her mom for several weeks and has had contact with Henry inside, but today was the first time that the three hippos have been together.""  The photogenic trio drifted around Hippo Cove, supervised by their care team, who were thrilled by the successful outing. At one point, while Fiona was frolicking up and down in the water, Henry nudged her and Bibi immediately stepped in to make him back off.  ""Bibi intervened when Henry got too close to Fiona, which was exactly what we were hoping to see,"" the zoo captioned the photo. There's also a video where you can see the bouncing little hippo and the moment where mom chastises dad.  Fiona was born in January weighing only 29 pounds, which is about 25 pounds lighter than the lowest recorded birth weight for the species, according to the zoo. The relatively tiny hippo caught the attention of the world as she struggled against all odds to survive, and was incredibly cute every step of the way. As of early June, she weighed nearly 300 pounds. Fiona was the first Nile hippo born at the Cincinnati Zoo in 75 years.  There's no set schedule for when Fiona will be outside or when Hippo Cove will be open to the public. The zoo is asking eager visitors to be patient as they give the family time to get used to each other. Until then, if you need a baby hippo fix, there's always Instagram.

"Play video content Breaking News  Kanye West says Taylor Swift was one of the factors that caused his nervous breakdown in 2016 -- namely, the aftermath of interrupting her at the VMAs and how it affected his radio play.  Ye released his interview with Charlamagne tha God Tuesday -- and in the first few minutes he explains what led to him being hospitalized in late November 2016. He says ever since he and Kim posted video seemingly showing Taylor knew about his infamous ""Famous"" lyric ahead of time ... his relationship with radio has never been the same.  He admits he wanted major radio play as one of the most popular artists in the world, and says the fact he simply wasn't getting it after he released 'Life of Pablo' screwed with his head.  Kanye also notes that the departure of L.A. Reid from Universal Music might've affected his radio dynamic ... but says it was just one of many stressors in his life at that point.

"Some of the most elite women in entertainment gathered to honor female achievement at ELLE’s Women in Hollywood event in Los Angeles Monday night — and used the opportunity to address the conversation that's finally starting to take place in Hollywood. Presenters and honorees acknowledged that a major shift was happening in their industry ever since reports of producer Harvey Weinstein’s alleged sexual harassment surfaced in The New York Times and The New Yorker.  “We honor the women you see on stage tonight, but also I would like this opportunity to honor every woman who has suffered sexual harassment, every woman who has stood up to a powerful man and said that what he is doing is wrong,""Jessica Chastain said in her speech. ""Women in Hollywood and beyond have had enough.”  In their speeches, several of the honorees and presenters took the opportunity to share their personal stories of dealing with sexual harassment and abuse in the entertainment industry — and talked about what happens next.  Reese Witherspoon  Getty Images  Before introducing her Big Little Lies co-star Laura Dern, Reese Witherspoon took the stage and revealed she was a victim of sexual assault when she was still underage.  I have my own experiences that have come back to me very vividly. I have found it hard to sleep. So many feelings — anxiety about being honest, guilt for not speaking up, disgust at the director who assaulted me when I was only 16, anger that I was made to feel that silence was a condition of my employment. I wish I could tell you that it was only one incident. Sadly, I have had multiple experiences and I don’t speak about them very often, but after hearing these women tonight, being so open and honest, it has made me want to speak up. And I actually feel less alone.  Jennifer Lawrence  Getty Images  In Jennifer Lawrence’s speech, the Oscar winner recognized that after gaining fame with movies like The Hunger Games, she has the “power to say no.” But she says when she was just starting out, she was once pressured into losing weight in a “degrading and humiliating” way.    When I was much younger and starting out, I was told by the producers of a film to lose 15 pounds in two weeks or I’d be fired. One girl before me had already been fired for not losing weight fast enough. During this time, a female producer had me do a nude lineup with about five women who were much thinner than me. We all stood side by side with only paste-ons covering our privates. After that degrading humiliating lineup, the female producer told me I should use the naked photos of myself as inspiration for my diet.  If at any point you’re wondering why didn’t I stick up for myself, I tried. I asked to speak to a producer about the unrealistic diet regime and he responded by telling me he didn’t know why everyone thought I was so fat. He thought I was perfectly “fuckable.”  Jessica Chastain  Getty Images  Jessica Chastain took the stage again to commend the women who have had the courage to speak up against their accusers — something the actress says she wasn’t always able to do for herself.  I had a producer spank me as I walked past him in a hallway. I didn’t speak up, because I was worried that I might be made un-hireable by dissenting. I have stopped making myself invisible, or small, and to my shock and happiness, my career has not stalled.  In speaking up, I’ve come to understand that if a director or a studio doesn’t hire me because of my stance on wage equality, diversity, or sexual harassment, then I’m fine with that. This is an industry rife with sexism, racism, and homophobia. It’s so closely woven into the fabric of the business that we’ve become snow-blind to the glaring injustices enacted every day.  I’m so inspired by the women who have been far braver than I am, who have come forward with their stories, and risked everything to protect others. What is important is that the voices of these women do not disappear in a somewhat fog of war way. We must amp"	1
Fans of The Walking Dead had to say farewell to yet another of their favorite characters Sunday night. In a year in which we’ve lost Carl (Chandler Riggs), Rick (Andrew Lincoln) and possibly Maggie (Lauren Cohan), Jesus (Tom Payne) breathed his last. In typical heroic fashion, he died trying to get others to safety.  While on a mission to rescue Eugene (Josh McDermott) with Daryl (Norman Reedus) and Aaron (Ross Marquand), the group found themselves in a graveyard with a new foe approaching. After fighting off a few walkers with ninja-like skill, Jesus took one last swing of the sword only to have the would-be walker duck, then stab him in the back. Other than Eugene and Rosita, this was the group’s first encounter with the Whisperers, living humans hiding among the dead.  Fans did not take Jesus’s death lightly.  Though many mourn, Payne was ready for his stint on the show to end. He said in a recent interview that he had become frustrated and bored with the character’s storyline.  The Walking Dead airs Sundays at 9 p.m. on AMC.  Check out the surprise twist at the end of Rick Grimes’s final episode of The Walking Dead:  Read more from Yahoo Entertainment:  Tell us what you think!

"Kathy Griffin spills all the Trump tea (and more) on her world tour  HOLLYWOOD – Kathy Griffin is back on U.S. soil, and she’s got a lot of material to get off her chest.  The comedian brought her Laugh Your Head Off World Tour to Hollywood Thursday night, serving up almost three hours of comedy in a high-octane set. In front of a packed house, Griffin gleefully spilled the tea on everything from the federal investigation surrounding her controversial fake and bloody Donald Trump photo shoot that went round the world to how she really feels about Ellen DeGeneres. (Spoiler: They are not friends).  At the sold-out Dolby Theater, Griffin, gearing up for the long haul in a pair of flats, ran out on stage jumping and dancing. “They said I would never work again, and you came!” she said to the packed crowd. Here's what to expect from Griffin’s latest act:  Kathy Griffin: 'Truth is, Roseanne has displayed herself to be a Nazi’  More: Kathy Griffin on tour, that 'harmless' bloody Trump photo, her gripe with Kevin Hart  There’s plenty of President Trump – and his family  “I’ve known this fool off and on for 20 years,” said Griffin, harking back to the time she first met Trump on the set of ""Suddenly Susan."" ""He said, 'Call me The Donald,' to which I said, 'OK – call me The Kathy.' And then I walked away."" Griffin went on to give less-than-flattering nicknames for Trump's adult children and doubled down on the president's purported ties with Russia. ""You know that pee-pee tape exists!"" she exclaimed.  A feud with Ellen DeGeneres  Griffin described how she got into a fight with DeGeneres after her mentor and friend Joan Rivers died. “One of the things that always hurt (Rivers) is that Ellen shunned her and thought she was vulgar and not funny,” Griffin said. “After Joan died I just called (DeGeneres) and I said, ‘Woman to woman, comic to comic, let it go and do a tribute to her ...' We got into a screaming match,"" said Griffin, adding: ""She’s scarier than the government.”  Kim and Kanye are actually good neighbors  Only in Hollywood would it turn out that Griffin and Kim Kardashian West and Kanye West were honest-to-goodness neighbors. “We actually had a shared wall,” said Griffin, revealing she has changed her stance on the reality show family. She even once called Kim to ask if her kids could come over to cheer up her 98-year-old mother, Maggie. (They came!) “I am pro-Kardashian,"" Griffin said. ""They let me make fun of them to their face, which is all I ask.”  No one is spared  Griffin let loose on a Rolodex of frenemies. Targets included her former publicist Cindi Berger (“I can’t get a publicist at all, so I can burn the bridge”), former New Year's Eve BFF Anderson Cooper (whom she referred to as ""Anderson Vanderbilt""), former Bravo boss Andy Cohen, Jeff Zucker (“He’s not smart enough to run CNN. He’s the guy who gave Emeril a sitcom!”), her short-lived attorney Lisa Bloom, Matt Lauer and Megyn Kelly.  Her darkest moments  Griffin said she spiraled after her Trump photo shoot brouhaha. Within days, her career imploded: Griffin’s stand-up shows were canceled, CNN fired her, and advertisers fled. Griffin recalled even getting dumped by Squatty Potty: ""That one hurt,” she deadpanned.  But for two months, ""I almost didn't leave my house at all,"" she said. Griffin closed by describing her FBI interrogation (an experience that wove together a sword, a porn awards show and Martha Stewart). She also championed First Amendment rights, imploring the audience to continue supporting comics who dare to take on the administration. “Over my dead body will I let this happen to another woman again,” she pronounced.

"The Colombian star postpones European tour dates until 2018.  After announcing the cancellation of her El Dorado Tour's opening concert (Nov. 8), and postponing four other shows thereafter, Shakira is forced to postpone all European tour stops to rest and fully recover from a suffered hemorrhage on her vocal cords.  The Colombian superstar took to social media once again with the news, penning an open letter to her fans via Instagram and her personal home site on Tuesday morning (Nov. 14).  ""For the last five months I’ve been wholly dedicated to preparing my El Dorado World Tour. However, these past few days, just before my first concerts, have been some of the hardest of my career,"" she said of the recently developed strain on her right vocal cord. ""Unfortunately the hemorrhage doesn’t appear to have reabsorbed and my nightmare continues. At the moment I find myself in a difficult battle as I try to fully recover.""  She added: ""It pains me not to be able to sing this month, for those have done even the impossible to get tickets and accompany me throughout the different countries of Europe.""  Shakira went on to thank her team, family members and especially her fans for understanding and sticking by her though the good and bad. In the end, she confirmed she will not be touring until further notice.  ""As such, and with a heavy heart, I must announce that I find myself obliged to postpone my European tour until 2018, to allow my body several necessary weeks, dedicated to my complete recovery.""

Not Jonathan and Nancy! Our fave IRL ‘Stranger Things’ couple, Charlie Heaton and Natalia Dyer, reportedly broke up in February — and he did the dumping. Oh no!  Charlie Heaton, 24, and Natalia Dyer, 21, are reportedly done. The Stranger Things couple on and off screen started dating in October 2016 before going public about a year later, but they allegedly just couldn’t make it work. “Charlie broke it off with Natalia. She’s heartbroken. She doesn’t know what went wrong,” a source told Life & Style. Poor Natalia! HollywoodLife.com has reached out to both Charlie and Natalia’s reps on this report.  The reported breakup was amicable, but obviously Natalia’s hurt. To make it sting worse, she thinks Charlie’s allegedly rubbing it in her face by very publicly partying and having fun without her. “Partying with his sister [has] been a kick in the teeth for Natalia,” the source said. “She’s basically been pushed aside without a second thought.”  Breakups are always awful, but if Natalia and Charlie did split, it’s going to be extra awkward. The two actors play lovebirds and partners in ass-kicking Jonathan and Nancy on Stranger Things. The third season of the show hasn’t even started filming, and there’s no indication that their characters will break up. They finally just got together in season 2! But, they’re professionals; they would be able to make it. It’s not the first time that costars have broken up and still played TV lovers (*cough* One Tree Hill), and it wouldn’t be the last.  Natalia stood by Charlie’s side when he was stopped at customs at LAX coming into the United States (he’s British) because his luggage reportedly had traces of cocaine. He was not arrested or charged with a crime, but it was still a public snafu. He apologized to his family and Stranger Things cast members, including Natalia. This situation is just the worst!	0

Recording Academy president Neil Portnow is facing a great deal of backlash following the 60th Annual Grammy Awards. After a slew of male winners and performers at the Sunday, January 28, show, at NYC’s Madison Square Garden. Portnow stated that women need to “step up” in order to be recognized.  After his statement, many female artists, including Katy Perry, Sheryl Crow and Pink, voiced their disappointment. Kelly Clarkson, who was nominated for Best Pop Solo Performance, took to Twitter on Wednesday, January 31, to respond.  “A confused soul said women need to ‘step up’ their A-game if they wanna start winning and you know what, I’m not even mad at ignorance,” the “Love So Soft” singer tweeted. “I’m just gonna kindly point you in the direction of my A-game album I recently dropped.”  Clarkson then added that she “Jenna Dewan’d that s—t,” referencing Dewan-Tatum’s hit film, Step Up.  Clarkson’s statement echoed that of Pink, who performed at the show.  “Women in music don’t need to ‘step up’ — women have been stepping since the beginning of time,” the singer, 38, tweeted on Monday, January 29. “Stepping up, and also stepping aside women OWNED music this year. They’ve been KILLING IT. And every year before this. When we celebrate and honor that talent and accomplishments of women, and how much women STEP UP every year, against all odds, we show the next generation of women and girls and boys and men what it means to be equal, and what it looks like to be fair.”  Alessia Cara was the only female to win during the telecast and Lorde, the only best album nominee — and only female in the category — was not asked to perform.  After the backlash, Portnow released a new statement, saying his “step up” comment was taken out of context.  “Our industry must recognize that women who dream of careers in music face barriers that men have never faced,” he told The New York Times on Tuesday, January 30. “We must actively work to eliminate these barriers and encourage women to live their dreams and express their passion and creativity through music. We must welcome, mentor and empower them. Our community will be richer for it.  “I regret that I wasn’t as articulate as I should have been in conveying this thought,” Portnow added. “I remain committed to doing everything I can to make our music community a better, safer and more representative place for everyone.”	1
While screwing in the plaque bearing his name, the students complimented Rudd’s precision. “I do a lot of work around the house,” he joked. “This is a Phillips head. Normally I would do this with a drill, but I didn’t bring my Makita with me.”  The party then moved through the Square to tour Harvard Yard. Rudd then received his Pudding Pot tonight at the closing ceremony, where he was roasted by the club members and participated in their latest show, “Intermission Impossible,” the company’s 170th production.  “The whole day has been a blast,” Rudd said during the press conference that followed the roast. “It’s been great getting to see Harvard. I’ve never been here before. It was so profound to walk through the Yard and learn about the history. I’m a bit of a history buff, and to be here … was very moving.”  The big question of Rudd was who he was rooting for in the Super Bowl on Sunday. Without hesitation, Rudd emphatically responded: “I’m rooting for the Philadelphia Eagles. The Belichick/Brady combo is the greatest ever, but I’m sick of seeing the Patriots win.”  When asked which of his film characters he most identified with, Rudd said, “I think my character in “I Love You, Man” because he had that kind of insecurity that sometimes makes you say dumb things in certain situations — [such as] you’re rooting for the Eagles over the Patriots when you’re in Boston.”	1
Introducing the President of the United States…Slim Shady?! After Eminem tore into Donald Trump with a savage freestyle rap, HollywoodLife.com has the EXCLUSIVE scoop on whether or not he’ll ‘pull a Kanye’ and run for office!  In a world where a real estate mogul/former reality television star can be elected to the highest office in the land, the idea of Eminem, 44, launching a presidential bid isn’t that farfetched. Some fans were hoping Em (born Marshall Mathers) would declare his candidacy after he lyrically demolished President Donald Trump, 71, at the start of the 2017 BET Hip-Hop Awards. “Eminem is very happy that his take down of Trump is getting so much attention,” a source close to the rapper EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com. “He feels that he has to use his gift for good and dropping the rap is his way to get his message out there.”  “As for taking it to the political stage and to run for office in any way? Not a chance in the world,” the insider tells HollywoodLife.com, crushing the hopes of anyone wanting an Eminem 2020 campaign sticker. “Marshall is not going to pull a Kanye [West] and announce his candidacy. The nonsense and the baggage that comes with politics, especially running for President would be outrageous.” While Eminem is no stranger to being “outrageous” and causing a controversy or two (especially about Donald Trump), seems politics are just not his jam.  After all, why dive into the political world when he could set the rap world on fire? Slim’s freestyle, which he called “The Storm” on Twitter (per CNN) saw him spit such red-hot lines like, “Same sh*t that he tormented Hillary [Clinton] for and he slandered and does it some more. From his endorsement of [Steve] Bannon, support for the Klansman, tiki torches in hand for the solider that’s black and comes home from Iraq and is still told to go back to Africa.” Damn.  “Eminem is a success at music and he wants to use his music for good. And it obviously shows that it is working with this recent attack on Trump,” the insider added. “He wants to provoke change in the way he knows how, and that is through his music.” So, that takes care of that. If music fans want to see a hip-hop influenced dude from Detroit run for officer, there’s always that rumored Kid Rock, 46, senate run. That’s…something, right?  Do you think Eminem should reconsider and run for office, HollywoodLifers?	0
"New York — David Beckham is following his wife into the beauty market with a label of his own for L'Oreal.  The soccer star will launch 21 men's grooming products under the name House 99 on 1 February in the UK. The products for beards, shaving, face, body, tattoos and hair will roll out to other retailers there and in 19 countries starting 1 March, Women's Wear Daily said Tuesday.  Beckham told a small number of journalists at a London news conference he chose the number 99 as a nod to a watershed year for him. He said: ""As a person, as a sportsman and I just became more mature because I had to with the birth of my first son, Brooklyn.""  He added that he ""created House 99 to give people the inspiration as well as the right products to experiment and feel completely at home doing so.

Smart move.  It was the year 1994 when model Elizabeth Hurley was catapulted to international stardom thanks to a few well-placed safety pins.  Hurley stole the show in a plunging black Versace dress at the London premiere of Four Weddings and a Funeral.  But despite it being considered one of the most iconic outfits of all time, the 52-year-old wouldn’t be caught dead wearing the dress in 2018.  Read more stories like this at news.com.au  On the set of a photoshoot for Grazia UK, The Royals star declined the chance to don the iconic outfit if stylists could track it down.  “I’m not sure I would, to be honest. People don’t like to wear their wedding dresses again do they?” Hurley told the publication.  “I think you couldn’t look better in it second time around. I mean, 24 years on, you could end up feeling slightly depressed, so, no!  “That dress is definitely for someone 20 years younger than me.”  Hurley was attending the 1994 film screening on the arm of the romantic comedy’s star Hugh Grant and quickly shifted the spotlight from the actor, who she was dating at the time.  While relatively conservative by today’s red carpet standards, her dress made the front page of newspapers and Hurley a household name.  Today Hurley is still making headlines, this time for the age-defying photos she shares on Instagram, which she admits are mostly taken by her 16-year-old son Damien.	1

Last year, singer Katy Perry revealed that Josh Groban inspired her hit song “The One That Got Away.”  On Thursday, Groban opened up on their secret relationship on “Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen,” confirming, “We did [date].”  “We were both very private, and so we realized we were better as friends. And we’ve been very, very good friends to this day,” Josh elaborated. “She’s the best. But I was not expecting that. That was a double take and a spit of my coffee when I saw that.”  Groban did note that he didn’t relate to some of the lyrics, explaining, “I listened to the lyrics, and I’m just like, ‘I never owned a Mustang. I don’t have a tattoo. Are you sure that’s about me?’ I’m very flattered by it, but I was very surprised by it, too.”  When Andy suggested that Josh call Katy, he said, “I’m not ghosting Katy! I think we’re both very taken at the moment, but it’s very sweet. It’s very sweet.”  Rumors started swirling about Katy and Josh in 2009.  In 2013, Groban addressed the rumors, telling Details magazine that he did “not really” date Katy. He added, “We might have skated on the line of dating.”  Josh is currently dating actress Schuyler Helford, while Katy has rekindled her relationship with Orlando Bloom.	1
"There's certainly been no shortage of drama thus far on Vanderpump Rules Season 6.  In fact, the conflicts and controversies are so plentiful that they're spilling off the screen and overflowing into our tabloids and Twitter timelines.  Just this morning, we learned that Faith Stowers faked being pregnant with Jax Taylor's baby in order to land a spot on the show.  Now, the afternoon is keeping pace with some old-fashioned, skinny-shamming, joke-missing outrage centering around an interview Stassi Schroeder gave to Daily Mail Australia.  Yes, Stassi is currently Down Under, delivering her caustic wit to the land of Vegemite and giant spiders that will eat your face while you sleep.  Asked how she maintains her trim figure despite a schedule that seems pretty well packed with work and social obligations, Stassi had this to say:  ""I'm really lazy,"" she told the outlet.  ""I stay thin by trying to starve myself for the most part, if I'm being honest. When I'm home in Los Angeles, it's like one meal a day.""  Stassi added, ""But when I go out of town or on work trips, it's breakfast, lunch and dinner.""  Now, this is an object lesson in the danger of print interviews.  If Stassi had tearfully confessed that she starves herself, the Mail would've said so.  As it is, they didn't describe her inflection at all, so we think it's safe to say that Stassi wasn't actually opening up to a group of Aussie strangers about her eating disorder, but was instead simply joking.  Sure enough, Stassi recently cleared things up on social media, tweeting:  ""Mmm. There was an element of sarcasm while I was doing that interview,"" along with several food emojis.  Sadly, emojis for ranch dressing and fried goat cheese balls don't exist yet.  Of course, her diet is far from the most dramatic element of Stassi's life these days.  On last night's episode of Vanderpump, viewers finally got to meet her longtime on-again, off-again boyfriend, Patrick Meagher.  Because people on the internet are easily confused, the appearance sparked rumors that Stassi and Patrick are back together.  As far as we know, that's not true, which is a good thing, as dude is a chronic mansplainer and he looks like Riff Raff.  Get you a man that looks like Khal Drogo and knows how to mix up a top-notch strawberry margarita, girl!

"Image copyright Getty Images  Taylor Swift has announced she'll be taking Charli XCX and Camila Cabello on the road with her for the Reputation Stadium Tour.  ""I've been wanting to tell you this for a really long time,"" Taylor said in a video posted on Twitter.  ""I'm really excited. I hope you are too, can't wait to see you, can't wait to see them,"" the singer added.  The 51-date tour starts in America in May before finishing up in New Zealand in November.  Both Charli and Camila will perform every night of the tour.  Minutes after the news was out, Charli XCX, well known for her cheeky lyrics and antics, volunteered to be the ""bad influence"" during the get together.  However, if Camila Cabello's reaction is anything to go by, there'll be as much play as work involved.  ""On every level, this is a dream come true,"" Camila wrote on Instagram.  ""As a fan, I'm going to be singing every song at the top of my lungs. As a friend, it's a GIANT SLEEPOVER.""  Joining Taylor Swift on tour should only increase Camila Cabello's status as one of the planet's rising stars.  After splitting from Fifth Harmony in December 2016, her self-titled album - Camila - was released in January 2018.  It featured the hits Havana and Never Be the Same.

Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani are taking aim at the constant tabloid rumors claiming that they’re having children. The country star poked fun at the seemingly never-ending speculation that Gwen may be pregnant with the couple’s child (or children) during a recent performance in Oklahoma, where he joked that his girlfriend of over two years had just given birth to twins.  Shelton made the joke about his girlfriend – who has three children with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale – while introducing her on stage to perform with him during a recent concert in his home state last week.  A video captured by concert goers, and obtained by PopCulture.com this week, shows the two teaming up to perform their 2016 duet “Go Ahead And Break My Heart” as they both stopped by Shelton’s restaurant and events space Ole Red in Tishomingo, Oklahoma, last week.  After Blake took the stage to perform a few of his hits, the crowd could then be heard chanting “Gwen! Gwen! Gwen!” as they encouraged the No Doubt singer to join her man on stage.  That’s when Blake invited Stefani to join him as he performed for fans, introducing her by joking to the crowd that they were all “lucky” to have her perform because she’d only just given birth to their twins the day before.  “You guys are very lucky that [she’s here],” Blake told the very excited crowd as he spoke about Gwen.  “She actually gave birth to twins yesterday,” the country star then joked of how they’re hounded by pregnancy rumors, “and she’s here tonight to sing with me.”  Gwen then joined her boyfriend on stage wearing a long grey shirt and thigh-high red boots as the couple, who first met when they were both coaches on NBC’s The Voice in 2014, performed their duet together.  #summer2017 ❤️love u guys gx A post shared by Gwen Stefani (@gwenstefani) on Jul 7, 2017 at 1:24pm PDT  The twosome then sweetly clapped for one another after finishing their performance, before sharing a quick kiss on the lips as the crowd looked on.  Loading...  Shelton, who was clearly in a playful mood as he performed for fans in his home state, then jokingly wiped his mouth and stared at his hand after sharing a kiss on the lips with Gwen as he poked a little fun at the star for the amount of lipstick she was wearing.  Of course, the star was only joking when he told the crowd that Stefani had given birth to twins one day earlier, though it was just a few days later that the couple proudly put their romance on display once again.  Featured image credit: Charley Gallay Getty Images  Though it appeared that they were separated for Valentine’s Day – likely due to Shelton’s busy touring schedule – Stefani gave fans a good look at how her boyfriend surprised her on February 14.  Gwen – who’s mom to three boys, 11-year-old Kingston, 9-year-old Zuma, and 3-year-old Apollo – shared various videos and photos on her Snapchat account of the stunning bouquet of pink flowers her boyfriend had delivered to her home in Los Angeles.  Stefani even gave fans a look at the message Blake wrote to her in his Valentine’s Day card, sharing a photo of the inside of the card she received from her fellow musician which read, “Happy Valentine’s Day. I love you! Blake.”	0
"Gigi Hadid hit social media on Monday to defend her arguably perfect body against some online haters, putting her life in stark relief against the lives of others whose problems include actual problems. Wait — strike that:  Gigi Hadid hit social media Monday to teach body-shamers a lesson they obviously deserve because the world should always be kind, gentle and supportive. And criticism-free.  Whew, that feels so much better.  The 20-year-old fashion model, who clocks in at 5-foot-10 and has already taken a daring stand about wanting to weigh more than ""2 pounds soaking wet,"" explained that despite being essentially superhuman, she's also just human.  ""Yes, judgment on social media comes from people who, 99% of the time, have no idea what they're talking about, but I'm human, and I'm not going to lie, I did let the negativity get to me a little,"" she wrote. ""I came to a realization that when one gets to this point, it's important to rethink why you're doing what you do. What your message is. What you have to say.""  See the most-read Entertainment stories this hour >>  And what does the daughter of a ""Real Housewives of Beverly Hills"" star have to say in the context of an industry that depends on hanger-like models fitting into size 0 clothes on the catwalk?  ""Yes, I have boobs, I have abs, I have a butt, I have thighs, but I'm not asking for special treatment. I'm fitting into the sample sizes.""  Also, she doesn't think she's the best model in every show but does think she needs to improve her runway walk.  A photo posted by Gigi Hadid (@gigihadid) on Sep 28, 2015 at 4:25am PDT  That said, any and all critics should get over themselves. ""If you don't like it, don't follow me, don't watch me, cause I'm not going anywhere,"" she said. ""If I didn't have the body I do, I wouldn't have the career I do. I love that I can be sexy. I'm proud of it.""  Hadid, who's BFFs with people like Taylor Swift, dates people like Joe Jonas and along with Kendall Jenner is kind of the model of the moment, has previously defended her looks.  ""I just want to be a healthy role model and I haven't swayed from that at all,"" she told the Daily Mail Australia in an August interview that also saw her describing the ""huge thighs"" she had as a Junior Olympian and explaining that she eats burgers regularly but then uses the Master Cleanse lemon-cayenne-and-maple-syrup liquid diet to snap back into shape for runway shows.  Tyra Banks, modeling's house mother, was supportive of Hadid's message on Monday.  ""I haven't met you yet @gighadid but I FEEL you so much,"" the ""America's Next Top Model"" star wrote when she regrammed the post. ""Your words are powerful. Your words are necessary. Your words are vulnerable. Your words are real. Sending you love and hugs. From one model that had curves and a unique walk to another, Tyra.""  Kris Jenner also had Gigi's back on Instagram, reposting the missive and adding, ""This is from one of the sweetest, smartest, and most beautiful girl inside and out, in the world. Why do people with no life, no purpose, who are angry and bitter and ignorant, or just plain nasty and mean, choose to bring everyone else down instead of finding the best in others? I will never understand the BULLYS that lurk on Instagram just to try and ruin someone else's spirit. If all of their horrible negative energy was focused on being positive and seeing good, imagine what a better more peaceful place this world would be.""  ""Spread love and joy everyone, not hate,"" Jenner continued, shaming snarky people everywhere. ""It only reflects what kind of person you are.""

Before Nikki Bella and John Cena announced on Sunday, April 15, that they had called it quits, they spent six years raving about each other. After being friends for years, the WWE Superstars began dating in 2012. Five years later, he proposed during the live broadcast of Wrestlemania 33 in April 2017, telling the world that he had been waiting for a very long time to ask for her hand in marriage. Cena, 40, and Bella, 34, were set to tie the knot on May 5 in Mexico.  On Sunday, Us Weekly was the first to report that the pair had ended their engagement. “While this decision was a difficult one, we continue to have a great deal of love and respect for one another,” the former couple said. “We ask that you respect our privacy during this time in our lives.”  Us Weekly exclusively revealed on Thursday, May 31, that the couple have reconciled  Scroll through the gallery to relive some of their best quotes about each other.	1
"When Petiana Grandson sings “Bring Me To Life” by Evanescence together at karaoke, it’s cute. When they talk about Harry Potter, it’s cute. And when Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson attempt to swing dance in a video together, it is cute. Almost disastrous, sure, but still cute. On Thursday, June 28, Grande shared a montage of clips she took with friends while dancing around in a rehearsal space on Instagram. In one of the snippets, Grande and Davidson dance together. The Grande and Davidson section of the video is short. It is cute. And it is dramatic.  At the top of the segment, Grande and Davidson clasp hands. He swings her through his legs. Everything seems to be going fine. Seconds later, that all changes. When it comes time to swing her back on her feet, both Davidson and Grande lose their balance. He stumbles backward, she stumbles forward, he catches her, and she laughs. “Oh, my god,” he exclaims. “That could’ve went very bad.”  Fortunately, the swing dance move attempt did not end poorly for either Grande or Davidson. No one fell to the ground, no one crashed into anyone’s nether regions, no shoulders were dislocated, no one twisted any limbs, and no one bruised any tailbones. Honest to god, no one was knocked out. Consider it a success.  In addition to the clip of the swing dance near-catastrophe, the IG post includes some snippets of Grande dancing around with her other pals. No one falls in the the other snippets. And yeah, all of it is cute.  Speaking of cute (huh, guess it is the word of the day), here is a wonderfully cute IG video Davidson shared on Thursday of Grande dancing around a baby sitting in a parked stroller.  Precious, precious stuff.  After Davidson and Grande made their coupledom Instagram official on May 30, their IG feeds and their IG Stories quickly turned into sources of cute couple content. In the last month, they have given us the Hogwarts robes pic, videos from their post-engagement trip to Disneyland, an engagement ring photo, and so many lovey dovey IG comments (sorry, Seth Rogen). They’re lovin’, they’re livin’, they’re Instagramming it up.  And they're shacking up together it up. And they're birthday-ing it up. And they're ""Evanescence""-ing it up. And they're TMI-ing it up. And they're Harry Potter-ing it up. And, as TMZ reported on Thursday, they're smoochin' and shoppin' it up.  And no, your calendar is not full of lies. It really has been only one month since Grande and Davidson announced on Instagram that they are dating. And it has only been a month and a half since Bossip reported that the “The Light Is Coming” singer and the Saturday Night Live performer are an item. Now, how does that old saying go again? Is it not something along the lines of, “Time turns into a jar of molasses when you are having a great time poring over adorable social media content created by two celebrities who seem very happy together and very much in love”? Sure, that feels about right.  Anyway, what is the over-under (har har har) on Davidson and Grande incorporating that swing dance move into their first dance at their wedding? Hey, they will have plenty of room to practice that swing dance move in that enormous new apartment they reportedly moved in to together. What is that other old saying? Something along the lines of, ""Home is where you spend hours trying to figure out ballroom dance moves like you are on Dancing with the Stars""? Sure, that feels about right."	1
“Mission: Impossible – Fallout,” the sixth (and best) entry in Tom Cruise’s action franchise, is 147 minutes of relentless action, convoluted and shocking twists and lots of Tom Cruise running.  Between the stunning fights, chases and helicopter shootouts, you can be forgiven for losing track of the plot, which doesn’t really matter anyway. That’s because “Fallout” opens with a giant exposition dump that encourages you to just sit back and have fun; don’t bother trying to make sense of it all.  So that you don’t have to sweat the small stuff, we’re here to help fill in the blanks.  (SPOILERS FOLLOW!!!)  Also Read: 'Mission Impossible: Fallout' Film Review: Cruise-ing for Bruising Action in This Jam-Packed Six-Quel  Two years after Ethan Hunt (Cruise) captured Solomon Lane (Sean Harris), the baddie from “Rogue Nation,” Lane’s agents, now known as The Apostles, are running rampant. They’re in pursuit of three plutonium cores to use within portable nuclear devices. Already these stakes are delightfully absurd.  Ethan plans to purchase and intercept the plutonium himself, but he loses it when he’s forced to choose between it and the life of his friend and teammate Luther (Ving Rhames).  The terrorists are working with an agent known only by the alias John Lark, who will rendezvous with a broker called the White Widow (Vanessa Kirby) to obtain the plutonium and arm the nuclear bombs. Fun Easter Egg: When we first meet the White Widow, she refers to her mom “Max,” who was the arms dealer played by Vanessa Redgrave in the very first “Mission: Impossible” film.  Also Read: Can 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout' Ride Critical Acclaim to Box Office Success?  If there’s one thread that’s been common among all the “Mission: Impossible” movies, it’s that Ethan and the IMF (Impossible Mission Force) are always in need of supervision and oversight from the CIA. In this case, CIA chief Erica Sloan (Angela Bassett) blames Ethan and the IMF for losing the plutonium in the first place, and assigns agent August Walker (a mustachioed Henry Cavill) to tag along with Ethan.  The two of them HALO jump out of a plane to sneak into a rave in Paris where Lark and the White Widow plan to meet. Ethan and Walker get in a wall-busting fist fight with the person they suspect could be Lark, leading Ethan to pose as Lark and meet with the White Widow himself. She informs him that in exchange for the plutonium, they need to break Lane out of holding as he’s being moved through Paris.  But after Ethan meets with the Widow, Walker and Sloan have a private meeting in which Walker accuses Ethan of truly being Lark. The man they killed in Paris was actually a decoy, and Ethan, burned by his government one too many times, might be secretly operating under the IMF’s nose.  Also Read: Tom Cruise Can't Keep Straight Face After First Line of Jimmy Fallon's 'Mad Lib Theater' (Video)  Here’s where things get really complicated, resulting in one of the franchise’s best exchanges of double-crossing and face mask trickery yet.  After capturing Lane, IMF chief Alan Hunley (Alec Baldwin) shares with Ethan the CIA’s accusation against him and that the White Widow has been an undercover CIA agent the whole time. And Walker is no babysitter, but an assassin tasked with killing Ethan should he go rogue.  With Ethan now under the microscope, he subdues Hunley and then proceeds to disguise Benji (Simon Pegg) as Lane, planning to hand him over to the terrorists in exchange for the plutonium, leaving Walker alone with the real Lane. It’s here where we learn that Walker, not Ethan, is the real John Lark. (gasp!)

But in a bizarre double switch, Walker realizes he’s been duped and realizes it was Benji in a Lane mask the whole time. Rather than just bring in W	1

What's more interesting though is how he found the photo in the first place. Looks like The Weeknd might be looking at"	1
It's a Christmas tradition.  No, not freezing in line to meet a grumpy department store Santa, forgetting to move the elf, or neglecting to water the tree - the annual unveiling of the Kardashian Christmas card.  And showing their always astute marketing judgement, this year's unveiling has taken an entire month.  Happy Kardashian Kristmas eve! Kim shares family picture... but fans are left wondering 'where's Kylie?'  Starting on December 1, the Kardashians have been sharing a new picture from their card every single day.  Many were close up shots of individual family members, often curiously cropped.  But on Sunday, Christmas Eve, came the most complete picture yet - with 12 family members lining up for the shot.  Father and son: Christmas celebrates the birth of Jesus, but this card is all about Yeesus  Shared by Kim Kardashian, her sister Kourtney and Kris Jenner to their Twitter accounts, mother and daughters used the simple caption 'DAY 24 - CHRISTMAS EVE'.  Featuring Kendall Jenner doing her best catwalk glare, a seated smiling grandma MJ, a host of adorable kids and a whole lot of denim, the card brought back memories of the Kardashian cards of Christmas past.  However one thing was missing, as fans were quick to point out - Kylie Jenner.  Curious cropping: MJ is the star is Day 20's card - which as Kim explained was not a teaser  With just one day left of the cards, anxious Kardashian lovers took to social media to wonder where Kim's 'pregnant' little sister was.  Many had initially thought the cards were outtakes, with the big reveal expected for December 25.  Some had speculated this would be a picture of Khloe and Kylie showing their bumps, or perhaps even Kim's new baby - which is due via surrogate imminently.  Family values: The Wests cosy up together  But after Kim clarified that 'These aren’t teasers these are the cards', her followers expressed their shock that Kylie had yet to make an entrance.  Twitter user Miss.Elmi expressed the horror of many when she wrote: 'Wait what? There’s no big surprise at the end?'  xtinaray reminded Kim: 'But you know who we all dying to see though...?'  Oh baby: Like Kylie, publicity-shy brother Rob has also been absent from the cards, but his daughter Dream has instead made an appearance  Kylie clamour: Fans were hoping the 'pregnant' Kardashian little sister would appear  Jasmin Moon saw the positive side of things, writing: 'Wait Kim this is Genious so this whole time everyone thought it was going to be this huge collage and in reality the photos were its own individual card? lol Love it.'  But others were just bemused, with Samantha Saylor complaining: 'Well that was a waste of time and money. Its not even creative..just messy!'	0

"American golfer  Eldrick Tont ""Tiger"" Woods (born December 30, 1975) is an American professional golfer. He is tied for first in PGA Tour wins and ranks second in men's major championship and also holds numerous golf records.[5] Woods is widely regarded as one of the greatest golfers, and one of the most famous athletes of all.  Following an outstanding junior, college, and amateur golf career, Woods turned professional in 1996 at the age of 20. By the end of April 1997, he had won three PGA Tour events in addition to his first major, the 1997 Masters, which he won by 12 strokes in a record-breaking performance. He reached number one in the world rankings for the first time in June 1997, less than a year after turning pro. Throughout the first decade of the 21st century, Woods was the dominant force in golf. He was the top-ranked golfer in the world from August 1999 to September 2004 (264 weeks) and again from June 2005 to October 2010 (281 weeks). During this time, he won 13 of golf's major championships.  The next decade of Woods' career was marked by comebacks from personal problems and injuries. He took a self-imposed hiatus from professional golf from December 2009 to early April 2010 in an attempt to resolve marital issues with his then-wife, Elin. Extramarital affairs with Woods had been alleged by several women, and the couple eventually divorced.[6] Woods fell to number 58 in the world rankings in November 2011 before ascending again to the No.1 ranking between March 2013 and May 2014.[7][8] However, injuries led him to undergo four back surgeries between 2014 and 2017.[9] Woods competed in only one tournament between August 2015 and January 2018, and he dropped off the list of the world's top 1,000 golfers.[10][11] On his return to regular competition, Woods made steady progress to the top of the game, winning his first tournament in five years at the Tour Championship in September 2018 and his first major in 11 years at the 2019 Masters.  Woods has held numerous golf records. He has been the number one player in the world for the most consecutive weeks and for the greatest total number of weeks of any golfer in history. He has been awarded PGA Player of the Year a record 11 times[12] and has won the Byron Nelson Award for lowest adjusted scoring average a record eight times. Woods has the record of leading the money list in ten different seasons. He has won 15 professional major golf championships (trailing only Jack Nicklaus, who leads with 18) and 82 PGA Tour events (tied for first all time with Sam Snead).[13] Woods leads all active golfers in career major wins and career PGA Tour wins. He is the youngest player to achieve the career Grand Slam, and the second golfer (after Nicklaus) to have achieved a career Grand Slam three times. Woods has won 18 World Golf Championships. In May 2019, Woods was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the fourth golfer to receive the honor.[14]  Background and family  Woods was born in 1975 in Cypress, California,[15] to Earl[16] and Kultida ""Tida"" Woods.[17] He is their only child and has two half-brothers, Earl Jr. and Kevin, as well as a half-sister named Royce from his father's first marriage.[18]  Kultida (née Punsawad) is originally from Thailand, where Earl had met her when he was on a tour of duty there in 1968. She is of mixed Thai, Chinese, and Dutch ancestry.[19] Earl was a retired lieutenant colonel and Vietnam War veteran who reported African American, Chinese, and Native American descent.[20] Earl's mother Maude Carter was light skinned.[21] Tiger describes his ethnic make-up as ""Cablinasian"" (a syllabic abbreviation he coined from Caucasian, Black, American Indian, and Asian).[22]  Woods' first name, Eldrick, was coined by his mother because it began with ""E"" (for Earl) and ended with ""K"" (for Kultida).

Paris Jackson is baffled this morning after reading headlines that she is just now confirming her bisexuality.  While answering fan inquiries recently via IG’s new Question Sticker, someone asked point blank, “Are you bi?” The daughter of Michael Jackson wrote in response: “That’s what you guys call it so i guess but who needs labels.”  The response was picked up by media outlets declaring that Jackson has revealed, or confirmed, that she is bisexual.  “EVERYONE HAS KNOWN FOR YEARS I CAME OUT WHEN I WAS 14 WTF,” she tweeted early Monday amid all the hubbub.  “How many times have I publicly referred to the community as “my fellow LGBTQ+”? like even on stage,” she added. “I’ve been a part of the community for years. I even mentioned having crushes on girls when I was 8 in a magazine before. I’ve been caught kissing girls in public. This is not news.”  how many times have i publicly referred to the community as “my fellow LGBTQ+”? like even on stage. i’ve been apart of the community for years. i even mentioned having crushes on girls when i was 8 in a magazine before. i’ve been caught kissing girls in public. this is not news… https://t.co/u9TLxE2c2x — Paris-Michael K. J. (@ParisJackson) July 16, 2018  Rumors about the 20-year-old’s sexuality were sparked when the model/actress appeared to be in a romantic fling with model Cara Delevingne.

Brad Pitt was recently rumored to hit on Margot Robbie at the pre-Oscar party in Los Angeles on March 1.  A tabloid claimed that the “Ocean’s Eleven” actor was spotted hovering near the actress because he wanted to have a conversation with her. When Robbie was finally free to talk, Pitt grabbed the chance and made sure that they could be together for hours. The tabloid even claimed that Pitt is smitten over the actress.  However, rumor debunking site Gossip Cop recently clarified that Pitt did not hover around Robbie until they could talk at the party. The actor did not also actively pursue the “I, Tonya” star.  The link between Pitt and Robbie started after it was revealed that the latter is in talks to star in Quentin Tarantino’s upcoming movie, “Once Upon A Time in Hollywood.” The film also stars Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio.  Meanwhile, the same tabloid also falsely claimed that Pitt and Jennifer Aniston have gotten back together recently. Aniston announced her split from Justin Theroux on Feb. 15, but the estranged couple have not been together since the end of last year.  Pitt, on the other hand, is still finalizing his divorce from Angelina Jolie. The “Maleficent” star filed a motion to end her marriage to Pitt in September 2016 following an incident that took place on a plane. Pitt allegedly had a brawl with his son, Maddox. The FBI investigated Jolie’s complaints, but they did not find any evidence of abuse against the actor. Pitt was later on cleared.  A source told US Weekly last month that Pitt and Jolie are amicable towards each other for the sake of their six children.  “This was a request to extend the temporary judge. They want things to remain private and they want things to be amicable. They both have kept the focus on their family. It hasn’t been easy but they are both committed to resolving it privately,” the source said.  Pitt and Jolie are parents to Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and Vivienne and Knox, 9.	0
The Good Fight wanted a piece of The Good Wife. Julianna Margulies confirms to TVLine that she was invited to bring Alicia Florrick over to the CBS All Access spinoff during the series’ inaugural season, but she wasn’t quite ready to go there.  “I really didn’t want to do it when they asked me in the first season,” she recalls, “because I didn’t think that was fair [to the series or its cast, led by Christine Baranski, Cush Jumbo and Rose Leslie]. I felt like, ‘Get on your own two feet. Do your thing.’ Because if Alicia had come in, in the first season, it would have been [all] about Alicia and The Good Wife. And now it’s their show.”  Margulies, however, does not rule out a future cameo on The Good Fight, which was recently renewed for a third season (to bow in early 2019). Despite harboring “uncomfortable” feelings about “going backwards” in her career, the three-time Emmy winner — who’s currently starring in AMC’s new ultra dark dramedy Dietland — says, “I never say never to anything, because I think that’s silly.”  Case in point: She returned to ER for that show’s final season. “It was one week and [George Clooney and I] had a blast,” Margulies enthuses. “It felt so comfortable to get back into that relationship and those clothes and those lines and let these characters — who were such a part of American culture — come back. So I would never say never because I loved going back to ER.”  Margulies watched the Good Fight pilot and thought it was “magnificent.” But she never made it to Episode 2 or beyond. “I said to [franchise creators] Robert and Michelle [King] recently that it’s hard for me to watch a law show right now, which is how I felt after ER,” she admits. “I couldn’t watch another medical show, because you go right back into [the mechanics of shooting a show like that]. It just takes you out of the show. I’ll binge watch it in a year or two.” (With reporting by Kim Roots)	1
"The hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius), or hippo, ancient Greek for ""river horse"" (Ιπποπόταμος), is a large mammal in Africa that usually eats plants. It is one of only two species in the family Hippopotamidae that are still alive. The other is the pygmy hippopotamus.  The hippopotamus is the second largest land animal in size, and the third largest land animal in weight. The elephant is the heaviest, and the white rhinoceros is the second heaviest, but a bit smaller than the hippo. The hippo is also the heaviest artiodactyl.  The hippopotamus is semi-aquatic. This means that even though it usually lives on the land, it spends a great amount of time in rivers and lakes where males lead groups of 5 to 30 females and young. In the daytime, they keep cool by staying in the water or mud. They give birth to baby hippos in the water, too. At dusk, they come out to graze on grass. Hippopotamuses rest together in the water, but they like to graze by themselves.  The hippopotamus has a torso that is shaped like a barrel, a very big mouth and teeth, an almost hairless body, short legs and great size. It is the third largest land mammal, judging by its weight, which is between between 1½ and 3 tonnes. The white rhinoceros weighs 1½ to 3½ tonnes, and the three species of elephant weigh 3 to 9 tonnes. Even though it has short, fat legs, it can run more quickly than a human. Some hippos have run at 30 km/h (19 mph) for short distances. The hippopotamus is one of the fiercest animals in the world. It is often called one of the most dangerous animals in Africa. There are about 125,000 to 150,000 hippos in Sub-Saharan Africa. Zambia (about 40,000) and Tanzania (20,000–30,000) have the most hippos. They are threatened because they are losing their habitats and being poached for their meat and ivory teeth.  The word ""hippopotamus"" comes from the ancient Greek ἱπποπόταμος, hippopotamos, from ἵππος, hippos, ""horse"", and ποταμός, potamos, which means ""river"". So, ""hippopotamus"" means ""horse of the river"".[3] More than one hippopotamus are called hippopotami, and 'hippopotamuses', or 'hippos' is also used.[4] Hippopotamusi are social. About 30 hippos live together in groups. A male hippopotamus is known as a bull. A female hippopotamus is called a cow, and a baby hippo is called a calf. The species is also known as the common hippopotamus or the Nile hippopotamus.  A hippo at the zoo in Lisbon  A drawing of a hippopotamus skeleton  Inside the mouth of a hippopotamus  Hippopotami are the fourth largest mammals in the world (after whales, elephants, and rhinoceroses). The Egyptian hippopotamus is smaller than the others. They can live in the water or on land. They can walk or even run along the bottom of a river.  Because hippos are so large, it is difficult to weigh them in the wild. Most adult male hippos weigh between 1,500–1,800 kg (3,300–4,000 lb). Females hippos are smaller, and usually weigh between 1,300–1,500 kg (2,900–3,300 lb). Older males can get even bigger. They are at least 3,200 kg (7,100 lb) and sometimes even weigh 4,500 kg (9,900 lb).[5][6]  Male hippos seem to keep on growing for their whole lives. Females hippos, though, become heaviest when they are about 25 years old.[7]  Hippos have big and heavy bodies, dark gray skin, and short legs. A hippo's main defence is their extremely strong mouth. They can grow to be 15 feet long and weigh 3,000 pounds.[8]  Hippopotami are herbivores which live in groups. Despite being semiaquatic and having webbed feet, an adult hippo is not a particularly good swimmer nor can it float. It is rarely found in deep water; when it is, the animal moves by porpoise-like leaps from the bottom.[9] They usually stay in the mud and water during the day and come out to eat grass or leaves at night. Though they are bulky animals, hippopotami can gallop at 30 km/h (19 mph) on land but normally trot.[9]  Many hippos lived in North Africa and Europe[10] until about 30,000 years ago. They used to be common in Eg"	1
"Things are heating up between Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost! On Thursday night, the duo finally made their first public appearance as a couple at the 2017 American Museum of Natural History Gala in NYC after six months of dating. While Colin and Scarlett hit the red carpet separately, the couple later met up inside, where they were joined by Colin's Saturday Night Live costars Michael Che, Aidy Bryant, and Leslie Jones. Aidy even shared a snap of Colin presenting at the gala on her Instagram story, writing, ""When you a hunk and you know it,"" likely referencing Colin's recent honor of being named 2017's Sexiest Joke Writer by People.  Colin and Scarlett have been keeping their relationship under the radar since they first got together in May, but earlier this month, they were spotted getting hot and heavy in the wee hours of the morning on a street in NYC. Now that the pair has finally made their public debut, hopefully they'll make their first joint red carpet appearance soon."	0
Parent-shaming is a mainstay of social media and, on occasion, can actually be helpful. If a commenter tells a celebrity (or a friend) not to do something that might hurt their kid, well, that’s useful. However, the comments section of many celebrity fathers’ accounts are full of deeply unhelpful advice. Take, for instance, Justin Timberlake’s account, which now features a photo of his son, Silas Timberlake, kissing his mom, Jessica Biel, followed by a mass of comments about the length of his son’s hair. According to internet busybodies — mostly male and mostly very certain of their views — having long hair is going to somehow damage the kid long-term.  The picture was taken in Paris and shows the three-year-old with shoulder length hair and a very loud and boat-themed romper kissing his mom on the lips. The caption reads, “If that pic doesn’t say ‘City Of Love’ then I’m out….” Privileged? Yes. Charming? Absolutely. Nonetheless, the internet did its thing.  “I thought that son was a daughter which is just another reason why it shouldn’t grow out,” wrote one commenter, before another took issue with his romper.  ADVERTISEMENT  “Long hair and feminine-romper looking thing… sheesh,” wrote another.  And then the back and forth begain.  “Who cares if his hair is long!” wrote one JT supporter. “We should focus on raising kind children, so maybe they don’t grow up and become mean grown-ups that usual social media as a bullying platform!”  How often does parenting make you feel emotionally exhausted? Never Sometimes Always Thanks for the feedback! Oops! Something went wrong. Please contact support@fatherly.com  “Can we stop thinking about his hair fl and marvel in the wonderful opportunity this child has of having loving parents, who on top of that take him to Paris at such a young age,” wrote another. (The likely answer is “no,” but it’s a worthy sentiment.)  Parent shaming is always annoying, but this example might be the worst to date as it checks both the “Who cares?” box and the “That’s Not a Thing” box. Also, these people are all failing to appreciate that the kid has very cool hair. Do with it what you will Silas, you’ve been blessed with a rock star mane.	1

Gwen Stefani’s three sons are loving their mom’s beau Blake Shelton so much that they are dropping hints to try and get him to propose to his lady love and become their stepdad. Get the EXCLUSIVE details here.  Gwen Stefani‘s sons Kingston, 11, Zuma, 9, and Apollo, 4, who she had with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale, 52, love their mom’s boyfriend Blake Shelton, 41, so much that they want him as a stepdad and are coming up with ways to get him to marry their mom! “Gwen’s kids are starting to drop subtle hints to Blake that they would love it if he would marry their mom,” a source close to Gwen shared EXCLUSIVELY with HollywoodLife. “They tell Blake that they love him and always want him around. The kids put pressure on Blake and make it known to him that they wish he was their stepdad. Their bond is strong with Blake and the older boys are confused as to why mom and Blake aren’t married already.” Aw!  With how much time Gwen’s boys and Blake spend together it’s not entirely surprising that they would love him to make things official. From going on adorable fishing trips in Blake’s home state of Oklahoma to spending holidays such as Easter together, Gwen and Blake’s clan always look cozy and comfortable together. Seeing the happy couple married seems like it would only intensify the cuteness!  When she’s not spending time with Blake and her kids, Gwen’s been preparing for her upcoming residency in Las Vegas. She’s set to kick off a series of concerts at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino on June 27 and a source previously told us that Blake can’t wait to babysit her boys when she’s off doing her thing! Although there’s been speculation that Gwen and Blake are thinking about possibly getting married in the near future, there’s been no official word yet. Perhaps they’ll take the step at a chapel in Vegas? We’ll have to wait and see!	0

DJ Pauly D and Aubrey O’Day started dating in 2016 after meeting on the set of “Famously Single.” The two split in 2017 but decided to head to “Marriage Boot Camp” to get some closure and now Pauly D is opening up about the experience.  WE TV’s “Marriage Boot Camp” is set to premiere on September 7. US Weekly caught up with the “Jersey Shore Family Vacation” star at the premiere party.  It was revealed earlier this year that Danity Kane singer Aubrey O’Day was involved in an affair with Donald Trump Jr. while he was married to his soon-to-be ex-wife, Vanessa.  Vanessa allegedly found emails between Aubrey and her husband where he promised he would be leaving his marriage for her.  This happened in 2012 after the two met on the set of “Celebrity Apprentice” but only recently made headlines which is why Pauly was asked if it contributed to their split.  “We didn’t address that at all. Yeah, I didn’t know anything about that. I guess [the news broke] after or something like that,” he explained.  He added that the show taped a year ago which is why he was in the dark about it.  As to why they did break up, the reality star wants you to tune in to see what happens.  “You know, some people just aren’t right for each other and we learned that. It’s probably kind of cool because you guys can watch it and see why. That’s why you have to tune in and find out exactly what went wrong, and then you get to live it with me.”  In the trailer for the relationship show, it seems that Pauly and Aubrey have the most tumultuous relationship in the group. O’Day accuses the 38-year-old of cheating which he vehemently denies.  Advertisement  Do you think DTJ was serious about being with the singer? Will you be watching “Marriage Boot Camp?”	1

Emily Simpson  Preview Tamra Judge and Emily Simpson Haven't Always Been Friends  Emily Simpson certainly made a splash in her inaugural season of RHOC in Season 13, finding herself at odds with the likes of Shannon Beador and Kelly Dodd. However, Emily's husband, Shane Simpson, also memorably found himself in some major Real Housewives drama at Eddie Judge's birthday party. He's also been a bit of a buzzy figure among RHOC fans. But overall, Emily's RHOC debut has been an inspiring one as she opened up about painful parts of her past and promoted body positivity.  Gina Kirschenheiter  Exclusive Did Emily Simpson and Gina Kirschenheiter Watch RHOC Before Coming On?  Some women come into The Real Housewives a little more on the timid side in their first season. Gina Kirschenheiter is not one of those women.

The actor criticized media outlets for ‘ridiculous’ comments about an outfit she wore during the press tour for her latest film  Jennifer Lawrence has criticized “sexist” media coverage of her fashion choices in a new Facebook post.  The Oscar-winning actor, currently on a press tour for thriller Red Sparrow, responded to comments suggesting that the sleeveless Versace outfit worn during a photocall in London implied that she was being mistreated alongside her coat-wearing male co-stars.  Red Sparrow review – perverse Jennifer Lawrence thriller offers mixed pleasures Read more  “Wow. I don’t really know where to get started on this ‘Jennifer Lawrence wearing a revealing dress in the cold’ controversy,” she wrote. “This is not only utterly ridiculous, I am extremely offended. That Versace dress was fabulous, you think I’m going to cover that gorgeous dress up with a coat and a scarf? I was outside for five minutes. I would have stood in the snow for that dress because I love fashion and that was my choice.”  An article in Jezebel had the headline, Please Give Jennifer Lawrence a Dang Coat, showing the actor’s co-stars, Joel Edgerton and Jeremy Irons among them, wearing large coats and scarves.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Red Sparrow photocall in London. Photograph: John Phillips/Getty Images  Similarly, Metro wrote that the men in the image are “nicely wrapped up bracing themselves against the chill of a bracing London winter, while Jennifer Lawrence is wearing a plunging thigh-split gown”. One tweet that called it “quietly depressing and revealing” received over 12,000 likes.  “This is sexist, this is ridiculous, this is not feminism,” she wrote. “Overreacting about everything someone says or does, creating controversy over silly innocuous things such as what I choose to wear or not wear, is not moving us forward. It’s creating silly distractions from real issues. Get a grip people. Everything you see me wear is my choice. And if I want to be cold THAT’S MY CHOICE TOO!”  The event in question took place at London’s Corinthia Hotel during a photocall for Red Sparrow, the espionage thriller in which Lawrence plays a prima ballerina turned Soviet spy who seduces men in order to gain intelligence from them.	1

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ryan Seacrest confirmed on Thursday that he will return as host of “American Idol,” the most popular music reality show in U.S. television history, when it comes back to the screen on ABC TV in 2018.  After much anticipation and speculation, Seacrest, who served as host of the talent competition show during its initial 15-season run that ended in April 2016, confirmed the news on “Live with Kelly and Ryan” Thursday morning.  “Is it OK if I announce this big news?” talk show host Kelly Ripa asked Seacrest, who was seated next to her. “I’ve been waiting and waiting.”  With a nod from Seacrest, Ripa said, “We’ve been talking about it for a little while, but I am happy to confirm ... that Ryan Seacrest is returning as the host of ‘American Idol,’” prompting cheers from the studio audience.  Seacrest has co-hosted ABC’s morning talk show with Ripa since May.  The radio and TV personality, who will continue to host “Live with Kelly and Ryan” from New York, said he was “very, very excited” about reprising his “American Idol” duties. He will also remain as host and executive producer of his syndicated radio program “On Air With Ryan Seacrest” from Los Angeles.  “It’s genuinely hard to put into words what ‘American Idol’ means to me,” Seacrest, 42, said in a statement. “I’m so grateful for the show and all the career and life opportunities it’s allowed me to experience.”  The show, which was canceled by Fox Television last year, was once a ratings powerhouse, watched by more than 30 million viewers at its peak in 2005-2007.  The glitzy talent show that launched the careers of Kelly Clarkson, Adam Lambert, Jennifer Hudson and others - spiced with celebrity judges who alternately feuded and fawned - eventually fell victim to declining ratings.

REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni/File Photo  Within the United States, the “American Idol” phenomenon spawned a host of competing shows such as NBC’s “The Voice,” CBS’s “Rock Star”, and Fox’s “The X Factor.”  Pop star Katy Perry, who is set to judge the next generation of artists on the show, took to Twitter to express her excitement about the news and sing the praises of Seacrest.  “I’m spicy, @RyanSeacrest is seasoned!” wrote Perry. “All the right ingredients are coming together on @AmericanIdol.”	1
"Lyle and Erik Menendez, the murderous brothers convicted of killing their millionaire parents in 1989, have reunited for the first time in more than two decades, according to a report.  Erik Menendez, 47, was transferred to 50-year-old Lyle Menendez’s designated section at Richard J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego, online records show.  The brothers last saw each other in 1996, when they were found guilty of murdering their father Jose and mother Kitty as they watched TV inside their $5 million estate in Beverly Hills on Aug. 20, 1989.  Authorities said they shot Jose Menendez several times in the head. Initially, their mother was only wounded.  But when she tried to crawl away, Lyle Menendez reloaded his shotgun and shot his mother several more times, officials said.  The brothers claimed they killed their parents after enduring years of abuse, but prosecutors argued they wanted access to their parents’ millions. They were each found guilty of two counts of murder and conspiracy to commit murder and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.  Lyle Menendez reportedly asked to be moved closer to his brother during his last hearing on his inmate classification status. He was then transferred from Mule Creek State Prison in Northern California to the R.J. Donovan Correctional Facility in San Diego on Feb. 22.  Erik was then moved to the same unit as his brother Wednesday.  ""He had been asking for it, and the department could find no reason they could not be at the same prison,"" Terry Thornton, a spokeswoman for the California Department of Corrections, told the New York Daily News. “There are people who are related who may also be crime partners, and it's not unprecedented for them to be living in the same prison or even sharing the same cell.""  The brothers, who are believed to have kept in contact only through letters, will now be able to spend time together at meals, during recreational periods and while exercising.  Tammi Menendez, who married Erik three years after his sentencing, told TheBlast.com that her husband is ""settling in"" and described the brothers' reunion as ""heartfelt.""

Users rebel against social media app’s new features while celebrities dump platform as it tries to appeal to new users  More than $1bn was wiped off Snap Inc’s market value on Thursday, in one of the company’s worst trading days since it went public last year – and the rout was led by a bored tweet from a member of the Kardashian clan.  Kylie Jenner, one of the first wave of celebrities whose fame grew primarily on Snapchat over other social media firms, shared her disappointment with the app on Twitter late on Wednesday: “sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore? Or is it just me ... ugh this is so sad,” she said. “[S]till love you tho snap ... my first love”.  Kylie Jenner (@KylieJenner) sooo does anyone else not open Snapchat anymore? Or is it just me... ugh this is so sad.  Jenner’s tweet, combined with growing fears on the part of investors that a long-awaited usability-focused redesign may not solve Snapchat’s user growth issues, sparked a plunge in the company’s stock, which fell 6% over the course of Thursday, clearing $1.3bn from its market capitalisation.  The redesign of the app saw Snapchat move away from its previous split between “messages” and “stories”, the social media convention invented by the company but usurped by Facebook’s Instagram. Now, Snapchat focuses attention on the division between friends and publishers, allowing it to more easily promote professional (and paid-for) content, while grouping everything from actual acquaintances in one place.  But it isn’t just Snapchat’s celebrity users and investors who have expressed frustration with the new direction the app has taken. A petition from more than 1.2 million users begged the company to reconsider its redesign, eventually forcing a somewhat dismissive response from Snap Inc itself.  “We completely understand the new Snapchat has felt uncomfortable for many,” the company said. However, it added, “this new foundation is just the beginning and we will always listen closely to find new ways to make the service better for everyone”.    The petition’s core complaint is that the new update “has not made the app easier to use, but has in fact made many features more difficult … Many ‘new features’ are useless or defeat the original purposes Snapchat has had for the past years.”  In the run up to the redesign, the company’s co-founder and chief executive Evan Spiegel promised it would satisfy concerns (particularly among investors) that Snapchat was too difficult to use. But he also hoped that the redesign could help fix some common problems faced by all social media apps, he told the Guardian before the launch.  “For a very long time, we have been trying to clarify, or at least distinguish, the difference between friends and publishers,” Spiegel said in November. “Like, on the Stories page, do you show friends or publishers first? Because our service was really built on this idea of helping friends communicate, we chose friends – and ultimately what that meant is that all of this awesome publisher content was all the way down at the bottom.”  Despite the criticism, Spiegel remains characteristically bolshy about the new design, telling a conference in San Francisco that “some of the complaints we’re seeing reinforce the philosophy.    “One of the complaints we got was, ‘wow I used to feel like this celebrity was my friend and now they don’t feel like my friend anymore’. And we’re like: ‘Exactly. They’re not your friend.’ So for us, even some of the frustrations we’re seeing really validate those changes. And it’ll take time for people to adjust.”	1
"The $20 million lawsuit filed against Usher for allegedly transmitting herpes to a Georgia woman has been dismissed.  ""It’s our sincere hope that this dismissal will bring an end to the opportunistic litigation against Usher in Georgia,"" Usher’s lawyer Steve Sadow told PEOPLE in a statement.  But Usher isn't in the clear yet. Rather, it seems what is going on is that the woman accusing Usher, whose name is Laura Helm, was unsatisfied with her attorney. The woman's new lawyer went ahead and dismissed the case without prejudice and ""with intent to refile,"" TMZ reports.  Usher's Georgia Accuser in Herpes Lawsuit Reveals Her Identity https://t.co/pBJqhae6Rd — TMZ (@TMZ) September 21, 2017  So, a brand new lawsuit will probably be filed in the coming days and weeks. Quantasia Sharpton has also accused Usher of potentially exposing her to herpes. Sharpton claims that she and Usher had ""sexual contact"" at a Days Inn in Atlantic City. The encounter allegedly took place back in 2014.  Usher has previously been in a similar situation. Back in 2012, the singer settled for $1.1 million after a woman accused him of infecting her with herpes.  Until the lawsuit is (possibly) refiled, Usher seems to be celebrating."	0

Riverdale is back! Well, the cast is back together at least, and we are officially excited for season three.  Although the return of the hit CW series isn't for a few more months—it returns this October—the cast has headed back to Vancouver to begin filming and you know what that means...lots of goofy photos from set.  Over the past couple of years we've fallen in love with the cast of Riverdale, both on (we see you Betty and Jug) and off screen. While fans are happy to see the stars of the show together all the time, it's clear that the cast mates themselves are even happier to be together whenever they can.  It's clear that the whole gang—from the parents on the series to the high school students—are really close and since we're low-key obsessed with the whole squad we fully support their adorable friendships.  Since we still have to make it through summer however, before we find out what's next for Archie (KJ Apa) and the gang, we've rounded up a few of the cast's sweetest friendship moments to hopefully make the waiting game a little less hard.  PS: We challenge you to not get jealous of these close BFFs while scrolling through our gallery below.  It's impossible...trust us.	1
Following very public breakups, longtime-acquaintances-turned friends Selena Gomez and Justin Theroux have reportedly become romantically involved.  According to Wednesday’s initial reports from Life & Style, the 25-year-old “Bad Liar” singer and the 46-year-old ex-husband of Jennifer Aniston have recently “become closer than ever.”  Related article: Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber’s “Break” Is Apparently Turning Into A Breakup  “They’ve known each other for years through their manager,” an insider explained to the publication, adding that their shared experience of both going through headline-breaking splits has pushed the pair closer. “Initially, they leaned on each other for emotional support after going through messy breakups,” the sourced continued.  It’s all simply speculation—no confirmation has come from Gomez, Theroux or either of their reps—though Life & Style‘s source adds fuel to the gossip by suggesting that Jennifer Aniston, “is not happy” about the rumored love connection between her Theroux and Gomez, her former husband of two years and friend, respectively.  Related article: All Of The Celebrity Breakups Of 2018  There’s certainly truth that Gomez and Theroux have been spending some time together.

"2017 studio album by Kesha  Rainbow is the third studio album by American singer Kesha. It was released on August 11, 2017 by Kemosabe and RCA Records. Primarily a pop record, Rainbow incorporates elements of pop rock, glam rock, neo soul, and country pop. Its lyrical themes range from letting go of the past, finding forgiveness within oneself for past mistakes, self-worth, and female empowerment.[3] Kesha assumed an integral role in the album's production and collaborated with several producers, including Ricky Reed, Drew Pearson, Ben Folds, and her mother Pebe Sebert.  Following the release of her second studio album, Warrior (2012), Kesha dealt with several struggles in her personal and professional life, including a stint in a treatment center for an eating disorder and emotional issues, as well as a highly publicized legal battle with her former record producer Dr. Luke, whom she accused of sexual, physical, and emotional abuse. Kesha began writing material for her next album while in rehab in 2014 and as her recording contract at the time obliged her to work with Dr. Luke, she later recorded a series of new songs on her own and gave them to her record label. In 2016, it was confirmed that work had officially commenced on Kesha's third studio album, with Sony Music Entertainment assuring Kesha she would be able to produce a new album without having to work with Dr. Luke, the founder of Kemosabe Records. ""Praying"" was released as the lead single from Rainbow in July 2017, going on to be certified platinum in several countries worldwide. ""Learn to Let Go"" and ""Woman"" were released as the second and third singles from the album thereafter, seeing moderate commercial success worldwide.[4][5]  Rainbow marks a noticeable departure from the electropop sound of Kesha's first two studio albums. She co-wrote all but two tracks on the album, and said that she wanted her new music to reflect that she is a ""real person having a complete human experience,"" stating that there was no balance in her previous work.[6] Kesha stated that the album was inspired by several of her musical influences, including Iggy Pop, T. Rex, Dolly Parton, The Beatles, The Rolling Stones, The Beach Boys, James Brown, and Sweet. The album also features collaborations and guest appearances by Parton, Eagles of Death Metal, and The Dap-Kings Horns.  Rainbow debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 chart in the United States with 117,000 album-equivalent units and was the subject of universal acclaim from music critics, with several complimenting the feminist angle and uniqueness of the record as well as Kesha's vocal performance and ability to interweave different genres of music on the album. The album has been certified Gold by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) and was nominated for Best Pop Vocal Album at the 60th Annual Grammy Awards, marking Kesha's first Grammy nomination. Kesha promoted the album through television and music festival performances and embarked on both the Rainbow Tour (2017–2019) and The Adventures of Kesha and Macklemore (2018), with American rapper Macklemore.  Background and recording [ edit ]  Rainbow ""quite literally"" saved her life. Kesha stated that""quite literally"" saved her life.  Kesha initially began writing songs for her third studio album while as a patient at Timberline Knolls, an Illinois treatment centre, for an eating disorder in 2014. Eager to write music while in treatment, a friend brought her a toy keyboard, and after some negotiation, the staff let her keep it.[6] She was not permitted to use any instrument with a power cord, explaining in an interview with Rolling Stone that the staff did not want her to have any objects that could be used for suicide: ""And I was like, 'I respect all of that, but please let me have a keyboard or my brain's going to explode. My head has all these song ideas in it, and I just really need to play an instrument.'""[7] She completed work on several songs while in treat"	1

"JonBenét's mother, Patsy Ramsey, took whatever secrets of that morning she had with her to the grave when she passed away after a 13-year battle with ovarian cancer that eventually spread to the brain. Though both she and her husband John were formally exonerated in 2008 thanks to developments in DNA technology, many still suspect that the former Miss West Virginia accidentally murdered her six-year-old child in a fit of rage over a bed-wetting accident then covered it up post haste. From the outside, Patsy was your pleasant and influential suburban mother of two, known for her beauty-pageant-winning daughter JonBenét and the lavish Christmas parties she threw every year. Still, several pieces of evidence suggest she may have had more to do with the crime than she let on.  First, it's been speculated that while cleaning up yet another one of JonBenét's bed-wetting accidents, which are said to have occurred with some frequency, Ramsey flipped a switch and slammed the little girl's head against the side of a hard, blunt surface like a bathtub. Second, JonBenét was found with a rope around her neck, tightened by a homemade garrote determined to have been fashioned out of a paintbrush taken from Patsy’s paint kit that lay nearby. Third, the most bizarre ransom note in the history of ransom notes: Patsy said she discovered a two-and-a-half page ransom note on one of the rungs down the spiral staircase that led to the basement where JonBenét’s body was found. Written in strange verbiage that seemed lifted from classic crime films, the note demanded $118,000 be given to the ""foreign faction"" by 10 a.m. the next day, which was later figured out to be the same amount of John Ramsey’s Christmas bonus from his company Access Graphics. Some sources, including Boulder PD’s former co-leading investigator Steve Thomas have speculated that Patsy wrote the note herself in a moment of panic after realizing what she'd done to JonBenét. But the handwriting analyses – though convincing – were eventually found to be inconclusive. It was determined, however, that the note had been written on a piece Patsy's stationary from inside the home with her own pen.  In the years following the murder, Patsy appeared extremely defensive, once even hashing it out with a naysayer on Larry King Live. While family friends insisted that Patsy adored JonBenét and would never have put the little girl in harm’s way, some onlookers came down hard, criticizing Ramsey for sexualizing a vulnerable child through a string of beauty pageants."	1
Baywatch babe Pam Anderson bares all in the most recent edition of King Kong magazine.  And by the looks of it, the busty beauty’s body hasn’t changed much since her days of running on beaches.  The 50-year-old Anderson stuns in a number of racy images in Issue 4 of King Kong alongside Sergei Polunin, the bad boy of ballet.  In one such image captured by U.S. photographer David LaChapelle, Polunin licks the upper portion of Anderson’s bare chest while caressing the former Playboy Playmate.  In another, Polunin is seen stalking the 1990s pin-up model while a fully-nude Anderson – martini in hand – gazes back over her shoulder.  Best known for playing C.J. Parker on Baywatch, Anderson appears to have no reservations about modelling in the buff despite blowing by the half-century mark.  A nearly-nude Anderson appeared in The Amorist last year. At 46, Anderson stripped down for French magazine Purple.  Anderson, who appeared on Playboy’s cover more than a dozen times, appeared late last month in a video tribute to the late Hugh Hefner.  “I have so many thoughts … I am me because of you,” Anderson said. “You taught me everything important about freedom and respect.  “Outside of my family, you were the most important person in my life.”	1

    The Carter clan is growing! Beyoncé and Jay Z welcomed twins earlier this week, multiple sources confirm to Us Weekly.  Queen Bey, 35, announced in February that she and the rapper, 47, were expanding their family.  “We would like to share our love and happiness,” Beyoncé captioned an Instagram photo of her bare bump at the time. “We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes.”  The “Hold Up” singer documented her pregnancy on social media and made several red carpet appearances while expecting. Although she had to pull out of her headlining Coachella appearance, she attended the Grammys, the Beauty and the Beast premiere and the inaugural Wearable Art Gala at the California African American Museum.  The couple’s new twins join their daughter Blue Ivy, 5. “They have been trying for a long time and now to be blessed with twins they are so over the moon. It’s even better than they wished for,” a source exclusively told Us earlier this year. “Blue is so excited to be a big sister!”  Beyoncé and Jay Z tied the knot in 2008 and recently celebrated their ninth wedding anniversary.  Showbiz 411 was the first to report the twins’ birth.	1
"Mandy Moore knows who she is, and who she isn't, meant to be.  In an interview with Bustle, the This Is Us star reflects on her time as a pop star, alongside the likes of Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.  ""They're dancers and they're entertainers and they're performers. They give their all — and costume changes! — and they can live on that level. And that was never going to be me,"" Moore says.  Though her time as a pop star was short-lived, Moore also discusses her transition into acting, and the break she took from Hollywood after marrying singer Ryan Adams in 2009.  ""When I think back to that particular time period that we're talking about… It was heavy,"" she shares. ""It was dark. It was confusing. It was lonely. There was no room for me. There was no room for me to have anything else in my life.”  Adams and Moore split in 2015, and the Tangled star says that it was a tough decision, but the right one for her.  ""It's no coincidence to me that once I did that hard work, life opened up in a way that I never could have expected,"" she notes. ""Once I did that, it was like, the sun came back out again. In every respect, I felt like, oh, now I'm living the life that I'm supposed to be living.""  Then, in 2016, Moore landed the role of Rebecca Pearson, the beloved mom on This Is Us, which has become a runaway hit, and earned Moore a Golden Globe nomination for Best Performance by an Actress in a Supporting Role.  Moore says the role of Rebecca, an aspiring singer, has been slowly boosting her confidence about pursuing music again.  ""Over the last year or two years since the show’s been on, those little comments being peppered into conversations give you the confidence,"" she explains. ""And to me, the wherewithal that people are like, ‘Oh, OK!’ I didn't know that people were even interested in that side of me anymore.”  Fans love Rebecca/Mandy's voice on the show, and the 34-year-old admitted she's still overcoming hesitations about the musical side of her life.  “You have to be your biggest advocate. No one's going to do it for you. It's a stunning realization,"" Moore says. ""There's a lot of weirdness wrapped up in music for me that I still have to work through. That I don't think I'm good enough. That I don't think I'm deserving. That I allowed other people to make me feel bad about wanting to do it.”  As for her long-term plans, Moore says she looks to another Hollywood star who started young and is now an absolute powerhouse advocate for women.  “I wanna find really female-focused [projects],"" she shares. ""I love what Reese Witherspoon is doing. I think she has impeccable taste and that she's a real champion for other women. And I want to do that in my own capacity. I want to maybe find something that has a musical lean to it.”  This Is Us returns Nov. 13 at 9 p.m. EST on NBC, and Moore can be heard reprising her role as Rapunzel in Ralph Breaks the Internet, along with all the other princess characters.

Courteney Cox has been reaching out to Jennifer Aniston to warn her not to fall weak and get back together with her ex Brad Pitt. Get EXCLUSIVE details!  Courteney Cox, 53, has been by her good friend Jennifer Aniston‘s side through her ups and downs and now that Jen is separated from husband Justin Theroux, 46, Courteney wants to make sure she doesn’t go back to Brad Pitt, 54. “Courteney immediately reached out to Jennifer urging her to leave Brad in the past after hearing rumors that Jen may be rekindling things with her ex,” a source close to Courteney EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife. “Courteney was with Jen through it all with Brad and with Justin too. Through good times and the bad, Courteney has helped Jen through relationship issues over the years and she still feels very protective of her friend.”  Now that Jen is single, Courteney wants her to get a fresh start and not go back to something that already ended badly. “Courteney pressured Jen as she issued a stern warning, move forward and find someone new,” the source continued. “Courteney‘s warning made it clear to Jen that friendly conversation with Brad may be, ‘OK,’ but she better not jump back in bed with him just because she is feeling weak or is going through a tough breakup!”  Courteney’s concern for Jen may be appropriate since there’s been reports that Jen and Brad have been talking regularly ever since her split from Justin. After a highly public marriage and split, the former lovebirds are used to being in the spotlight both professionally and personally. Only time will tell whether or not they rekindle a romance but the two have seemed to stay friendly over the years. Now that time has gone by and they’re both single again, it wouldn’t surprise us if they find their way back into each other’s arms.	0

After Nick Viall and his pro partner Peta Murgatroyd were eliminated from “Dancing With the Stars” Monday night, he was clearly disappointed but his initial reaction seemed gracious.  The recent “Bachelor” star said the right things before the cameras, gushing about Murgatroyd and the whole “DWTS” experience, saying, “I had such an amazing time with Peta. She’s a fantastic partner; we had fun all the time.”  But behind the scenes it might have been a different story, with Viall reportedly attributing his failure to win enough votes from viewers to people and situations beyond his ballroom dance abiilty, according to the tabloid OK!  Viall felt that Murgatroyd, who gave birth earlier this year, didn’t give it her all. He also was telling other cast members that he thought he was facing backlash over the recent arrest of fellow “Bachelor” alum Chris Soules, a source told OK!  Soules, who competed on Season 19 of “The Bachelor” in 2015, was arrested last week in connection with a truck crash in Iowa that killed a 66-year-old farmer. Soules has been charged with leaving the scene of a traffic fatality and is being investigated for possibly driving under the influence at the time of the crash.  “He was not in a good mood after being eliminated and told cast members that he felt like Chris Soules’ incident had an impact on him,” an insider told OK! “Basically, he was blaming everyone else but himself.”  The OK! report didn’t mention that “Star Trek” legend William Shatner, a rabid, high-profile “Dancing WIth the Stars” fan, campaigned against Viall. Early in this season of the TV ballroom dance competition, Shatner took to Twitter to urge other viewers to vote Viall off the show.  Viall and Mugatroyd did an Argentine tango Monday night and received two nines and two eights from the judges, but it wasn’t enough to keep them in the competition.  The site Wellpaint said it looked like Murgatroyd put a lot into her performances with Viall — and her effort probably brought the two of them further in this highly competitive season than most fans expected.  After Viall was eliminated, he called his loss a “bummer” before being asked about Soules, who was said to be a friend of his. He called it a “terrible situation.”  “Obviously more than anything my heart goes out to the person who passed away and their family and I’m just praying for everyone involved,” he said, according to E! News.  Whether Viall is bitter about the “Dancing With the Stars” exit, he has said that he’s ready to leave behind the world of reality TV for good.  “My time in reality TV is probably done,” the 36-year-old told Life & Style Weekly. Instead he’s focused on launching a grooming line and spending more time with his “Bachelor” fiancee Vanessa Grimaldi.  “Vanessa and I, we’re going to keep doing our thing,” he said. “Dancing’s over, that’s a bummer, but I’m really looking forward to the future and definitely spending more time with the business and Vanessa.”	1
"Do you want to build a sandman?  It was a pairing only Halloween could provide.  Subbing for host Jimmy Kimmel on ABC's late-night program, Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl stepped in for holiday duty sporting a white beard, glasses and letterman jacket to impersonate former late-night stalwart David Letterman. Grohl welcomed guest Kristen Bell, who also appeared in costume as Tom Selleck's Thomas Magnum from the 1980s TV series, Magnum P.I., and told the Good Place star how his children were big fans of her 2013 Disney hit, Frozen.  ""If I was to jam a song with you, I would become the coolest dad in the world,"" Grohl told Bell. Bell was quick to oblige and launched into a rendition of ""Do You Want to Build a Snowman."" Grohl accompanied on drums.  As the song went on, it took a noticeably heavier turn and Bell began belting out Metallica's ""Enter Sandman.""  Watch the video below."	1

Fonda was a vocal anti-war activist during the Vietnam War, sparking controversy with her infamous “Hanoi Jane” photograph. Since then, Fonda has been known for supporting and championing dozens of causes, including the Georgia Campaign for Adolescent Power & Potential, for which she raised money at her big 80th birthday bash this past December. “If it didn’t make a difference for famous people to speak out, the right wing wouldn’t object. We are like repeaters,” she told Vanity Fair then. “Repeaters are the towers that you see at the top of mountains that pick up signals from the valley and carry them over the mountains to a broader audience. And that’s what celebrities do, if we’re doing our job right. We’re picking up the voices of people who can’t be heard and broadcasting their story.”	1

Jennifer Lopez was apparently worried enough about the state of her four-month romance with Alex Rodriguez that she hired a private investigator to confirm or debunk allegations that he is a serial cheater who was still seeing a former mistress, according to a report in Us Weekly. Related Articles Jennifer Lopez: ditching undies to rock revealing Billboard Latin Music Awards outfits?  Jennifer Lopez and Alex Rodriguez on romantic getaway  Jennifer Lopez has moved on to Alex Rodriguez, report says  Jennifer Lopez and Drake’s supposed romance ‘fizzles’  Jennifer Lopez is a cougar, and she explains why  Lopez made this move because she was alarmed by a story that broke in the National Enquirer in June, in which his alleged former mistress Lauren Hunter claimed that the former New York Yankees third baseman isn’t faithful, the report said.  “I don’t think he’s sexually attracted to her,” Hunter told the Enquirer.  Hunter, 34, said her affair with Rodriguez began in 2011 when he was still seeing actress Cameron Diaz. Hunter said their affair continued even after she had a baby with former football star Marcus Allen in 2014.  Hunter added that Rodriguez contacted her as recently as May about having a rendezvous, and she has the text messages to prove it. Stories about Lopez, 47, and Rodriguez, 41, dating began in March and they went public with their relationship at the Met Gala in New York in May.  But Hunter contended that he was probably imagining her when he was with Lopez and described his very adventurous sexual tastes, including threesomes.

In response to these allegations, the singer and actress took a cue from one of her current jobs, playing an NYPD detective in the NBC crime drama “Shades of Blue.” She hired a private detective to tail Rodriguez, an “insider” told Us.  “She’s really into Alex and wants it to work,” the source added. “So she’s trying to control as much as she can.”  But her need to control angered Rodriguez when he found out about the detective.  “They had a huge fight,” the insider told Us.  Despite this apparent breakdown of trust in this fledging relationship, the two are determined to work “through it,” Us Weekly said.  More recently, they’ve acted like everything is wonderful between them, gushing over each other in interviews. Earlier this month, J. Lo told Extra that her beau is “a beautiful person” and a “loving father” to his daughters, Natasha, 12, and Ella, 9, whom he shares with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis.  “He’s a generous human being with his family, with his friends, with me,” Lopez told the outlet. “He’s caring and sweet and capable and responsible and just all the beautiful things you would want a man to be. I feel really lucky right now, so I’m excited about life, but I’m more excited for people to get to see who he really is.”  Rodriguez has apparently spent time with Lopez’ 9-year-old twins Emma and Max with her ex-husband Marc Anthony. He had similarly adoring things to say about Lopez during a March appearance on “The View,” Us said.  “We’re having a great time,” he said. “She’s an amazing, amazing girl. One of the smartest human beings I’ve ever met and also an incredible mother.”	0

"In this July 17, 2017, file photo, Anthony Bourdain attends ""An Inconvenient Sequel: Truth To Power"" New York screening at the Whitby Hotel in New York City. Bourdain died earlier this month.  Anthony Bourdain drank significantly the evening before his death, a local French prosecutor told NBC.  Christian de Rocquigny, the prosecutor investigating the celebrity chef's death, would not disclose the amount of alcohol, but said there were signs he had drank significantly the night before he died. He added that there were no narcotics in his body; only a ""therapeutic dose"" of a nonnarcotic medication. He would not disclose the name of the medication.  De Rocquigny said there were signs of a ""repas arrosé,"" a French term typically translated as a ""boozy dinner."" He said ""it remains likely"" that Bourdain had ""a high consumption"" of alcohol the night before his death.  He has already said that Bourdain's death did not seem suspicious, and added that there was no indication that his previous findings had changed.

"Retired hockey player Mike Comrie will not be charged.  The rape charges brought against Mike Comrie, a former professional hockey player and the ex-husband of Hilary Duff, have been dropped due to insufficient evidence.  This February, the 36-year-old sports star -- who has a five-year-old son named Luca with Hilary -- was accused of raping a woman multiple times after meeting her at a bar.  The unidentified woman claimed the sex was consensual until Mike allegedly began engaging in anal sex.  According to the accuser, the non-consensual anal sex lasted for 45 seconds. Additionally, the accuser says that the Canadian furniture company heir refused to stop when she asked him to and slapped her.  TMZ first reported the alleged assault and revealed another woman was involved but has not reported any misconduct, according to a source. Following the incident, the alleged victim went to a nearby hospital where a rape kit was administered.  However, prosecutors said there was reasonable doubt as to whether the accuser consented to anal sex during the alleged sexual encounter in February.  View this post on Instagram A post shared by Hilary Duff (@hilaryduff) on May 14, 2017 at 7:50pm PDT  Mikie and Hilary, 29, ended their four-year marriage in January 2014. They finalised their divorce in January 2016, and have shared custody of Luca.  Hilary broke her silence following their split in a candid interview with Cosmopolitan.  ""It wasn't working well enough to stay together, but there was still a lot of love involved,"" Hilary told the publication in 2015. ""It was just a slow set-in of us not being the match that we used to be. I'm lucky for the person he is and I am and how we decided to handle this.""  Mike played for the National Hockey League in the US for 13 years and retired in 2012 from the Pittsburgh Penguins."	1
"Amy Schumer isn't one to play by the rules.  The actress appeared on the Today show Monday morning with Goldie Hawn, her co-star in the pair's new film, Snatched, and while there, Schumer managed to slip in a dirty joke despite host Savannah Guthrie's warning to ""stay classy.""  ""Amy just said the most terrifying thing,"" Guthrie said at the start of the actress' appearance. ""She said, 'Is this live?' And I said, 'Yes, Amy, it's live !'""  ""I said, 'Don't worry. I've grown. I've evolved,"" Schumer responded. ""I'm wearing flowers. 'Who is this woman?'""  Hawn joked, ""I didn't even recognize her!""  ""Stay classy,"" Guthrie warned Schumer. ""It's morning TV.""  During the interview, Guthrie references the actress' recent appearance on The Graham Norton Show, in which Hawn said Schumer ""could have been my daughter,"" but she ""would have been a troubled daughter.""  Hawn also noted that if Schumer were her daughter, she'd have no advice to offer her.  ""You don't give advice,"" Hawn said. ""What advice do you give somebody?"" Schumer replied, ""'Keep your feet in a bucket.' That's what my mom said. Because you can't open your legs...if they're in a bucket.' What? I know it's the morning, but..."" Guthrie quickly realized what Schumer had said, and admitted she didn't see the joke coming until it was too late. See the full video here."	1

The 37-year-old reality star criticized Scott, 34, for going to Cannes in May with Bella Thorne, 20, while her sister Kourtney was there with new beau Younes Bendjima.  'They looked so desperate at the airport. Who goes to LAX together? It's not a good look for Scott,' Kim said to her sister Kendall.  Not impressed: Kourtney Kardashian was critical of Scott Disick's behavior in Cannes during Sunday's episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians  'He talked to me about it. He thinks it is and I said, ''Are you nuts? Are you actually not well?'' And he was like, ''Yeah, I'm doing it to make Kourtney mad.'' I said, ''You're not going to make her mad for the right reasons'',' Kendall said.  Kim later shared her frustration.  'I think it's clear to everyone that Scott's doing this just to try to one-up Kourtney and that seems super malicious,' Kim said.  She added: 'Kourtney's genuinely trying to go away and have a good time and he's trying to like freak her out and make Kourtney think there's going to be some crazy drama run-in. It's just so ridiculous.'  Bad look: The Kardashians thought Scott went to Cannes just to annoy Kourtney  Party guy: Scott showed up at the airport with Bella Thorne on his way to Cannes  Kourtney, 38, meanwhile called her ex Scott a 'psychopath' after he threatened to have people attack Younes in Cannes.

    James Corden may be able to sing karaoke, but it’s Halle Berry who just came out with the digs! On the Tuesday, October 24, premiere of TBS’ new sketch show, Drop the Mic, which pins two celebs up against each other in an epic rap battle, both Berry and Corden got in some personal digs.  It all began with Berry’s career choices. “Let’s not pretend that Catwoman didn’t suck. Halle, that was a Batman movie, how’d you mess that up?” Corden began. However, she was ready!  “I’m glad Swordfish was to your satisfaction. It’s probably the only time your d-ck has seen some action,” she rapped. “Yes, everybody knows Catwoman tanked, but I took Kingsman to the mother f-ckin’ bank… James has a Tony, that’s cool and all. But I have an Oscar, so suck my monster balls.”  From there, he got personal.  “Halle is a classic. This whole thing’s tragic. You’re just Viola Davis but not as charismatic,” he rapped. “Sure you won an Oscar but I question the voters. I use my Gothica DVD as a drink coaster… 2008 you were Sexiest Woman Alive. Was that a moment when Beyoncé briefly died?”  The late night host ended with the divorce jokes, while she ended with a sex dig.  “When it comes to getting married, three divorces is enough. Forget signing autographs. Sign a prenup,” he said. “You’ve done so many X-Men movies, maybe a dozen. I heard X-Men and I thought it was about your husbands.”  “Now, why are you so angry and pushy? Of course, you hated Catwoman you never get p–sy,” Berry said.  In the end, she was named the clear winner.  Drop the Mic airs on TBS on Tuesdays at 10:30 p.m. ET.	1

"The 'Grace and Frankie' star will appear as prosecutor Jack McCoy later this season.  Jack is back.  Sam Waterston, who starred on Law & Order for 16 seasons, will reprise his role as prosecutor Jack McCoy on Law & Order: SVU, The Hollywood Reporter has learned.  The actor will guest-star on an upcoming episode of the NBC spinoff's 19th season, which kicks off Sept. 27. The role reunites him with new SVU showrunner Michael Chernuchin, who worked on Waterston's first two seasons of the mothership and helped create the character of Jack McCoy. Fellow SVU exec producer Julie Martin also worked on the final season of the original series.  Waterston joined the NBC legal drama in its fifth season and stayed through the drama's 20th and final season. NBC then abruptly canceled the series in 2010 — one season before Law & Order could break Gunsmoke's record for longest-running primetime drama.  Law & Order's abrupt cancellation means the writers were unable to wrap up storylines for Jack and the other characters. (Fellow longtime cast member S. Epatha Merkerson had already planned to exit at the end of season 20 and was given an emotional final season arc in which her character battled breast cancer.)  This will actually be Jack McCoy's fourth appearance on SVU following several crossovers in the early aughts. In recent years, SVU has welcomed back other characters from the mothership including prosecutors Connie Rubirosa (Alana De La Garza) and Michael Cutter (Linus Roache).  During his 16-season stint on Law & Order, Waterston won a Screen Actors Guild award for best actor in a drama series and earned three Emmy nominations in the same category. Since Law & Order, he was gone on to roles in Aaron Sorkin's HBO drama The Newsroom as well as movies including Miss Sloane and Please Be Normal.  In addition to his starring role on the Netflix comedy Grace & Frankie, Waterston will next appear in the Netflix Western miniseries Godless. He is repped by Gersh and Industry Entertainment.  Despite his busy schedule, Waterston expressed interest in reviving Jack McCoy as recently as 2015, when NBC and Dick Wolf were in talks for a potential Law & Order revival. ""Sure, I'd love it,"" Waterston told THR in May 2015. ""Got to break the record.""  Chernuchin also talked to THR about bringing back Jack McCoy earlier this year when he was the showrunner on Chicago Justice. Justice saw the return of several flagship favorites including Richard Brooks, Lorraine Toussaint and Tovah Feldshuh. ""We actually talked for a brief second about having Sam come in, but we thought it was too early,"" Chernuchin told THR in January. ""But maybe in the future.""  However, Chicago Justice was canceled in May after one season and Chernuchin subsequently took over the top job at SVU. In his move to SVU, Chernuchin is bringing an important member of the Law & Order universe with him: prosecutor Peter Stone, the son of Law & Order character Ben Stone, played by Waterston's predecessor Michael Moriarty. Philip Winchester played the role of Peter on Chicago Justice and will join SVU full-time later this season.  ""We've connected all the Dick Wolf shows,"" Chernuchin told THR recently about adding Winchester to the cast. ""The original New York franchise, the Chicago franchise, it's like the small Dickensian universe in London where different characters show up in different novels. That was one of the intriguing things to me by bringing Philip over, is to connect all the franchises.""  Like SVU, which pulls solid numbers in syndication on USA Network, Law & Order continues to live on in repeats on TNT, SundanceTV and WeTV, among other channels.  Law & Order: SVU returns Wednesday, Sept. 27 at 9 p.m."	1

Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani are taking aim at the constant tabloid rumors claiming that they’re having children. The country star poked fun at the seemingly never-ending speculation that Gwen may be pregnant with the couple’s child (or children) during a recent performance in Oklahoma, where he joked that his girlfriend of over two years had just given birth to twins.  Shelton made the joke about his girlfriend – who has three children with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale – while introducing her on stage to perform with him during a recent concert in his home state last week.  A video captured by concert goers, and obtained by PopCulture.com this week, shows the two teaming up to perform their 2016 duet “Go Ahead And Break My Heart” as they both stopped by Shelton’s restaurant and events space Ole Red in Tishomingo, Oklahoma, last week.  After Blake took the stage to perform a few of his hits, the crowd could then be heard chanting “Gwen! Gwen! Gwen!” as they encouraged the No Doubt singer to join her man on stage.  That’s when Blake invited Stefani to join him as he performed for fans, introducing her by joking to the crowd that they were all “lucky” to have her perform because she’d only just given birth to their twins the day before.  “You guys are very lucky that [she’s here],” Blake told the very excited crowd as he spoke about Gwen.  “She actually gave birth to twins yesterday,” the country star then joked of how they’re hounded by pregnancy rumors, “and she’s here tonight to sing with me.”  Gwen then joined her boyfriend on stage wearing a long grey shirt and thigh-high red boots as the couple, who first met when they were both coaches on NBC’s The Voice in 2014, performed their duet together.  #summer2017 ❤️love u guys gx A post shared by Gwen Stefani (@gwenstefani) on Jul 7, 2017 at 1:24pm PDT  The twosome then sweetly clapped for one another after finishing their performance, before sharing a quick kiss on the lips as the crowd looked on.  Loading...  Shelton, who was clearly in a playful mood as he performed for fans in his home state, then jokingly wiped his mouth and stared at his hand after sharing a kiss on the lips with Gwen as he poked a little fun at the star for the amount of lipstick she was wearing.  Of course, the star was only joking when he told the crowd that Stefani had given birth to twins one day earlier, though it was just a few days later that the couple proudly put their romance on display once again.  Featured image credit: Charley Gallay Getty Images  Though it appeared that they were separated for Valentine’s Day – likely due to Shelton’s busy touring schedule – Stefani gave fans a good look at how her boyfriend surprised her on February 14.  Gwen – who’s mom to three boys, 11-year-old Kingston, 9-year-old Zuma, and 3-year-old Apollo – shared various videos and photos on her Snapchat account of the stunning bouquet of pink flowers her boyfriend had delivered to her home in Los Angeles.  Stefani even gave fans a look at the message Blake wrote to her in his Valentine’s Day card, sharing a photo of the inside of the card she received from her fellow musician which read, “Happy Valentine’s Day. I love you! Blake.”	0
"Zsa Zsa, the World's Ugliest Dog, dies at age 9  Zsa Zsa, a rescued English bulldog with a nasty underbite and dangling tongue that earned her the title of ""World's Ugliest Dog"" last month, died Tuesday. She was 9 years old.  On a Facebook page for Zsa Zsa, owner Megan Brainard confirmed the dog died in her sleep.  ""She’s been staying over at my dad’s house. He woke up this morning and found her passed away,"" Brainard told Today.com. ""I’m still in shock.""  Just a few weeks ago, Zsa Zsa won the hearts of judges in Petaluma, California, when she earned the top prize at the 2018 World's Ugliest Dog contest — and $1,500 for Brainard.  A puppy-mill dog, Zsa Zsa was rescued after five years by nonprofit Underdog Rescue.  ""From the moment we saw her beautiful face, we knew we would be her forever home,"" Brainard said after her pet won the contest at the Sonoma-Marin County Fair.  More: World's Ugliest Dog title goes to ... Zsa Zsa, the English bulldog  Brainard, of Anoka, Minnesota, drove 30 hours to bring Zsa Zsa, named after actress Zsa Zsa Gabor, to the show, she told Today.com.  While mean-spirited in name, the contest promotes advocacy and adoption for all dogs, regardless of how mangy the mutts may be.  ""This world-renowned event celebrates the imperfections that make all dogs special and unique,"" the contest states on its website.  Follow Ryan Miller on Twitter @RyanW_Miller"	1
"Meghan Markle just added a Welsh gold wedding band to her jewelry box after marrying Prince Harry two weeks ago, but the new Duchess of Sussex already owns quite an array of rings and bangles. While she only just gained access to the Queen's vault of jewels — her wedding tiara counted as ""something borrowed"" — Meghan may refrain from borrowing some of the glitzier pieces.  Her penchant for minimal, delicate pieces in warm golds puts her at odds with what her new in-laws frequently sport. In fact, you have to really zero in on photos to catch a clear glimpse of what she wore. On the other hand, the Duchess of Cambridge favors jewelry that's a little bigger than whisper-thin.  ""People compare her a lot to Kate [Middleton] obviously, and Kate tends to wear slightly larger, more colorful pieces,"" says royal jewelry expert Ella Kay of The Court Jeweller. ""She really likes matching sets of jewelry, but Meghan is much trendier ... a little less in that traditional English, royal mode. ""  Here's how Meghan's minimalist pieces stack up:"	1

The parents of a six-year-old boy who went viral in a heartbreaking photo showing him sitting all alone at his birthday pizza party, have revealed they now regret sharing the picture.  Mother Sil Mazzini says she shared the snap in the heat of the moment, after becoming upset that none of her son Teddy's 32 classmates had showed up to the event at Peter Piper Pizza in Tucson, Arizona on Sunday.  The photo, which Mazzini shared to a local news reporter Nick VinZant, showed little Teddy looking sad as he sat on his own in front of long table filled with pizzas and dozens of empty paper plates.  She added that she deeply regretted ever sharing the post, which quickly went viral with more than 2,000 comments and more than 1,000 shares.  'If I could go back in time back to that Sunday night I would have never sent the photo online. We are overwhelmed and can’t believe a photo would go viral like this. I hate it every minute of this exposure,' she said to DailyMail.com.  Parents Ted Bollinger and Sil Mazzini say they regret sharing the viral photo of their six-year-old son Teddy sitting alone when no one showed up to his pizza birthday party on Sunday  Sil Mazzini says she wishes she didn't share the picture of Teddy at his birthday pizza party in Tucson, Arizona saying: 'I was upset. That’s why I wrote a message. But I never expected any of this, for this to go so viral'  When it comes to next year's birthday, Mazzini says Teddy will have no party at all.  'No we are not. Not anymore, I don't think so because it's so much planning for me. I will just take him on a trip,' she said to the New York Post.  This year he had the option to go to Disney World, Legoland, or have a party with his class. He unfortunately chose the latter.  Mazzini said her family was heartbroken that no one showed up to Teddy's party. She believes that families may have been worn out from the school's Halloween carnival on Saturday where students showed up with their parents.  On top of that on Sunday - her son's birthday - it was raining.  But still only one parent called her following the incident to apologize for being a no-show.  'I was bummed, I was bummed out for sure,' father Ted Bollinger said.  'Teddy, the biggest things for him was having his classmates there, so not seeing them show up an hour into the party was disappointing,' he added.  Thankfully Teddy wasn't disheartened for long and enjoyed playing the arcade games and eating the pizza.  'He's six, so he was distracted by the arcade games, the pizza, he got over it quick. He’s tough. But when Sil told me she was posting [the photo], I told her not to do it, but she did and it took off. It’s pretty wild,' Bollinger said.  Teddy was also just grateful to spend his special day with his father, who works in an Alaska oil field and is often absent for weeks at a time.  'So at the end of the day, he was very happy,' Mazzini said.  Parents said Teddy got over his sadness at the party and enjoyed the pizza, arcade games, and spending time with his dad Ted who works in oil fields in Alaska and is often away from home  The family has been criticized for begging for sympathy on social media. Sil said: 'We didn’t do this for attention or for gifts or anything. I did it in the moment but I wasn’t smart. I was upset. That’s it'. Teddy pictured in a Halloween costume left and with mom Sil right  Mazzini said she received 'like 15 RSVPS' and was incredulous when not a single classmate of Teddy's at BASIS Tuscon Primary School showed up.  'I sent invitations two weeks in advance with my phone number and had 32 goodie bags full of toys for each kid in the class,' Mazzini said to DailyMail.com.  Upset with her hard work and having to pay the bill of $130 even after no one showed up, her friend urged her to post the picture online so Teddy could at least get some birthday wishes.  But now she regrets sharing the photo and she's says she's disheartened by the negative comments accusing her of begging for sympathy 	1
Country songbird Miranda Lambert is flying high — and bringing ex-husband Blake Shelton to a new low — now that her dirt-dishing new album is a smash hit!  The 33-year-old Texas firecracker led all performers in nominations for this year’s Country Music Association Awards with nods for her album The Weight of These Wings and her tell-all hit songs Vice and Tin Man.  Meanwhile, Blake, now cuddling with platinum-blond pop doll Gwen ­Stefani, was shut out for the second year in a row!  PHOTOS: Miranda Lambert & New Boyfriend Anderson East Caught Kissing Backstage  “Miranda can’t keep from smiling these days,” a friend says. “She ­suffered at Blake’s hands, but now the world is coming up roses and that pain of l­osing her man has faded into the rearview mirror.  “And that she’s beating Blake at his own country music game, it just makes it all the sweeter. She’s laughing all the way to the bank.”  The album airs her dirty laundry about Blake jilting her.  PHOTOS: Gwen Stefani & Blake Shelton Getting Bonuses For PDA  “If you want to hear my side of the story or my opinion of what ­happened, it’s all on there,” she says. “There’s no mystery anymore.”  The feisty blonde and Shelton, 41, were married for four years before he socked her with divorce papers in July 2015. Miranda “was completely blindsided by what Blake did,” says a pal.  Even more painful for Miranda, Blake hooked up with Gwen, his fellow judge on The Voice, only months later.  PHOTOS: Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani Spotted After Spending Thanksgiving Together On FaceTime  But Miranda has found love again with singer Anderson East — and a friend says she can’t wait to show him off on the Nov. 8 CMA Awards on ABC.  “Miranda will have Anderson by her side,” another friend says. “She hopes Blake gets sick of her marching back and forth to the stage while she scoops up awards.”  We pay for juicy info!

"The real reason Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux split  In news that shocked the world and left pretty much all of us believing that love is dead, Hollywood power couple Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced that their marriage was ending in February 2018. The estranged duo issued a joint statement to the The Associated Press that said, in part: ""Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else's fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.""  The superstars didn't have much more to say about the matter publicly, though Theroux did crack the door open a bit later that year. However, questions abound about the dynamics between the pair. Aniston and Theroux reportedly got together in 2011, got engaged in 2012, and got married in 2015. Everything seemed peachy keen from the outside, so what the heck happened to this seemingly happy husband and wife? Let's explore some of the potential reasons these two went their separate ways."	0
Hollywood A-lister suggests the treatment of some celebrities, such as Garrison Keillor, has been excessive  This article is more than 1 year old  This article is more than 1 year old  Liam Neeson has described the wave of sexual misconduct allegations that have swept the entertainment industry as “a bit of a witch-hunt” and appeared to dismiss breast groping as “childhood stuff” in an interview on Irish television.  Speaking on The Late Late Show on RTE, the Hollywood A-lister said “there’s some people, famous people, being suddenly accused of touching some girl’s knee, or something, and suddenly they’re being dropped from their program, or something”.  The Late Late Show (@RTELateLateShow) Liam Neeson on the wave of sexual harassment allegations against high profile men in Hollywood #latelate pic.twitter.com/NzT0rWXf25  The French actor Catherine Deneuve drew sharp criticism this week when she also used the term “witch-hunt” to describe the chain of events since allegations of serial sexual assault were made against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein last year.  Asked what he thought of the sweep of allegations in his industry, Neeson said: “It’s a bit of a witch-hunt.”  Neeson, one of Hollywood’s most bankable and respected stars, referred to the recent case of the writer and broadcaster Garrison Keillor to illustrate his point.  Keillor was fired by Minnesota Public Radio late last year over allegations of “inappropriate behavior with an individual who worked with him”.  Neither MPR nor Keillor’s accuser publicly disclosed the details of the allegations that led to his dismissal..  In The Late Late Show interview, Neeson echoed Keillor’s version of the events that led to the allegations against him, which framed them as a well-intentioned misunderstanding.  Garrison Keillor: the downfall of a beloved figure accused of misconduct Read more  Keillor told a local newspaper following his dismissal: “I put my hand on a woman’s bare back. I meant to pat her back after she told me about her unhappiness and her shirt was open and my hand went up it about six inches. She recoiled. I apologized. I sent her an email of apology later and she replied that she had forgiven me ... We continued to be friendly right up until her lawyer called.”  Asked how he felt about Kevin Spacey and Dustin Hoffman, actors who have been accused of multiple counts of sexual misconduct, Neeson said he was “on the fence” about allegations against Hoffman, saying that what he had been accused of was “childhood stuff”.  Discussing the allegations against Hoffman, Neeson said, “when you’re doing a play and you’re with your family – other actors, technicians – you do silly things ... and it becomes kind of superstitious, if you don’t do it every night you think it’s going to jinx the show”.  Dustin Hoffman has been accused of sexual assault by multiple women, of exposing himself to a minor and of sexual harassment.  Neeson was quick to distance himself from Hoffman’s alleged behaviour, saying: “I’m not saying I’ve done similar things to what he’s done.”	1
Next Up The Blacklist 7x06 Sneak Peek The Team Makes a Fatal Mistake  Now Playing Stephen Colbert Dances With Handmaids at the Emmys  Sure, it's been over a year since Stranger Things debuted, but due to Emmy rules, the Netflix horror series was still eligible for trophies this year. That's good news for us, because it means the show's young actors can put on tiny tuxedos and petite gowns and charm us again.  Though the show went home empty-handed from Sunday's awards (although it did win five prizes at the Creative Arts Emmys the week prior), that didn't stop the charming child stars from having a good time anyway.  Millie Bobby Brown, Finn Wolfhard, Noah Schnapp, Gaten Matarazzo and Caleb McLaughlin — old pros at this by now — walked the red carpet ahead of the show. But Matarazzo and McLaughlin got the party started early back at their hotel, before they even arrived on the red carpet.

"Amber Heard is speaking out for the first time about what it's like being married to A-list actor Johnny Depp.    The couple tied the knot in two ceremonies this past February and a few months later, Heard has only good things to report about being a wife.    WATCH: Johnny Depp Admits That He's 'Weird'    ""Nothing is a dramatic change. We've been together for a long time now, so it's been a fairly organic process,"" the actress tells ELLE magazine. ""I have a fiercely independent spirit.""  ELLE  That being said, the 29-year-old starlet has a very real fear of the price of fame, which is inevitable when you're Depp's wife and a gorgeous actress.    NEWS: Amber Heard Says She Can Go 'Trailer Park' Real Fast    ""The thing that really scares me is the potential of losing my freedom. I never want for my life to lose the ability to transverse the world, with freedom and ease,"" she says. ""The freedom and ease I have worked so hard to acquire for myself.""

Heard goes on to speak out about the lack of diverse roles for women in film.  ""I get a stack of scripts, like, once a month, and most of the time, you find these placeholder girls that are there to provide a bounce for the male character,"" she explains. ""So we know he's funny because she's serious and she's mad at him. We know he's strong because she needs saving. So really her job is to validate this personality trait of our hero or male. I mean we're trying to imitate life, and it seems to me a deeply saddening injustice that we are so uncreative and uninterested in developing representations of female life.""

entertainment  To be a successful actor means you have to be very brave. You need to be prepared to let everything hang out for the world to see.  That doesn’t just mean exposing your emotional vulnerabilities, either. Actors often have to peel off their clothes and pretend to get intimate with folks who are, for the most part, strangers.  If you’ve ever wondered what’s going through an actor’s head when they’re filming sex scenes, you’re not alone. Thankfully, more than one actor has spoken out about this strange situation. Keep going to hear what they have to say about filming sex scenes!  1. Rosamond Pike on Gone Girl: “You are alone with a man who’s not your husband; he’s in his underwear, you’re in your underwear, and you’re sort of dry humping on a bed… we think, ‘OK, we should be professional about this. We should film this on an iPhone and see how it looks.’ Then you watch this thing back and it looks like we’re making some sort of super creepy home porn movie.”  2. Justin Timberlake on Friends With Benefits: “It’s actually kind of annoying. You’re there for 12 hours; it’s exhausting,” Timberlake told BBC Newsbeat. “All those scenes revolve around the dialogue and physical humor is so tiring.”  3. Amy Schumer on Trainwreck: “The sex scenes that are funny, I don’t care, but the ones that are actually sexual, it’s like these people are seeing me be really vulnerable,” Schumer told The New York Times. “Frank, who’s holding the boom, is seeing, ‘Oh, this is what Amy is like when she really means business.’ In between every single take, I think I screamed, ‘It’s so embarrassing!'”  4. Michael Fassbender on Shame: “You talk with your partner and say, ‘What are you comfortable with? What are you not comfortable with?’ And then you go for it. You try and throw away the safety nets and not worry where the camera’s gonna be or how you’re gonna look or worry about looking ugly.”  5. Jennifer Lopez on The Boy Next Door: “Those scenes are embarrassing. They are uncomfortable, but your job as an actress or an actor is to make it believable, and this movie in particular … hinges on if that was believable, that it was enough to make this guy go insane.”  6. Hugh Grant on Four Weddings and a Funeral: “The conventional response to sex scenes is that they’re horrible and not sexy and it’s all so unnatural. But I’ve always found filming sex scenes to be quite a turn-on. I like the experience of being in a sexual position when you’re not supposed to be in one.”  7. Mindy Kaling on The Mindy Project: Kaling isn’t afraid to get real about fake sex. “Obviously on-screen sex is not actual penetrative sex, but as any religious high-schooler will tell you, simulating sex can be pretty damn enjoyable as well.”  8. Jake Gyllenhaal on Love & Other Drugs: “It’s not awkward; it’s our job,” he said with loads of sarcasm in a recent interview. “That’s the tough life of being an actor in the movie business nowadays. It’s exhausting.” It must be, Jake; most of us will never know.  9. Jennifer Lawrence on Passengers: “I called my mom, and I was like, ‘Will you just tell me it’s OK?’ It was just very vulnerable. And you don’t know what’s too much. You want to do it real, you want everything to be real, but then… that was the most vulnerable I’ve ever been.”  10. Ashton Kutcher on No Strings Attached: “There is sort of always this awkward state of, ‘Is this OK? Is that OK?’ And then in between, it’s like, just, ‘Let’s act like nothing happened.’ And then you see how good of an actor you really are.”  11. Dakota Johnson on Fifty Shades of Grey: “Filming a sex scene is not a sensual or pleasurable environment. It’s really hot—not in a steamy, sexual way. It’s just sweaty and it’s not very comfortable. And on top of that, my hands and legs were tied, and I was blindfolded, and I was being hit with this bizarre tool.”  12. Ryan Reynolds on The Change-Up: “The scene is over now… And I reflexively, like an idiot, just put my hands right back on her breasts. And I	1

If you’re worried about looking even slightly childish, this probably isn’t the strap type for you, which likely resembles the overalls you wore as a kid. However, they’re great for petite or tall frames who may need to adjust straps for length — there’s a lot of wiggle room here. You can also wear them looser for a more laid-back, boyfriend vibe, or make them tighter to sit higher and less slouchy on the chest.    Also, keep in mind that metal buttons and buckles may or may not be the most comfortable. They’re cold on bare skin and can push into the shoulder if you’re carrying a heavy tote. But, there’s no denying that this is the classic overalls look, perfect with a striped tee or simple turtleneck for that effortless French, street-style worthy feel.	1
Kourtney Kardashian Hoodie NOT A “Message” To Scott Disick, Despite Claim  www.gossipcop.com / Saturday, 24 February 2018 14:01:14  Kourtney Kardashian was not sending a “message” to Scott Disick with her choice of hoodie, despite a speculative claim.

MARGOT Robbie has kicked off the new year in spectacular fashion, winning Best Actress in a comedy award at the 2018 Critics’ Choice Awards for her starring role in I, Tonya.  It was the Australian star’s second win at the annual awards show, after being named Best Actress in an action movie in 2016 for Suicide Squad.  A stunned Robbie, 27, who missed out on the prize in the same category to Ladybird’s Saoirse Ronan at the Golden Globes earlier this week, appeared to be on the verge of tears as she was announced as the winner.  media_camera The actress was visibly emotional.

Kidman has in the past attracted attention for acknowledging only her two daughters with husband Keith Urban in award show speeches, and not the two adult adopted children she raised with ex-husband Tom Cruise. ‘I wanna thank all of my children who show me so much love,’ she said.

Two months ago, Gavin Russom danced like no one was watching on national TV. As LCD Soundsystem debuted new songs on “Saturday Night Live,” Russom could be spotted just over James Murphy’s shoulder, lost in a groove. The band’s resident synth and electronics wizard, who joined officially during the recording of 2010’s This Is Happening, was wearing a T-shirt nodding at Octavia E. Butler—the sci-fi pioneer whose Patternist series offering an alternate history of humankind had become a recent source of comfort for Russom.  “Butler even uses the word transition to describe this moment in the Patternists’ lives: They have these latent powers and then suddenly something would shift where their process accelerated,” Russom says. “A lot of that felt like what happened to me. Over the last year and a half, I went from my trans identity being something I was in touch with and worked through in one way or another, to suddenly this shift where it’s on the front burner. Now it's time to become a whole person.”  After touring and recording with LCD Soundsystem last year, Russom took time off to focus on her own self-care, ultimately finding support in New York City’s large and diverse community of trans women. The step-by-step process has led Russom here: “A new photo that reflects how I feel comfortable expressing myself, feminine pronouns, and I'm using my old name.”  Her name carries clout in the electronic music world. Over the last two decades, Russom established herself by creating custom analog synthesizers for Murphy’s DFA Records, as well as via her musical output with Delia Gonzalez and the Crystal Ark. As a solo performer, most often under the moniker Black Meteoric Star, Russom’s heavy acid-house and techno bubbles with the fire and creativity of early Detroit acts.  On July 13th, the eve of LCD’s headlining set at Pitchfork Music Festival, Russom will DJ publicly for the first time as a trans woman during Femme’s Room, a popular monthly party celebrating femme and queer culture. Russom was asked to DJ the event, held at Chicago’s Berlin nightclub, before the organizers knew she was trans. “Having not said anything about my gender identity or transition, it felt like this amazing synchronicity,” she says, “one of those moments where the universe is tapping you on the shoulder, [saying], ‘It's OK, it's real.’”  In a frank phone conversation over the holiday weekend, Russom shared her story for the first time. This is it, carefully compiled from her own words.  I'm 43 and I can identify that once a decade, I made a concerted effort to make my trans identity known. That includes a period of time when I was a child in the ’70s, when I was going through puberty in the ’80s, and then several periods throughout my twenties, thirties, and forties. What makes this time different is that I'm in a stable moment in my life. Working with LCD Soundsystem all last year and then having a solid block of time off to focus on self-care was really important for me. This is what came out of that. I don't like coming out so much as a term, but sometimes it's the only way to say it.  In early twenties, I was on my way to coming out into transitioning. I would dress gender nonconforming and quite often explicitly feminine, and I would talk to people that I felt a closeness to about what I was going through. I experienced a lot of violence and harassment. That was part of my daily experience. Sometimes, if they happened to be walking behind me at enough distance where they would read me as feminine, they would catcall me. Getting closer to me, they would see me as masculine and then become very angry. I was assaulted on a number of occasions.  I do think the world has changed, to some degree. I have to say that makes me hopeful. Things are different than they were in 1997, despite our current overarching political system. That's not to say there isn’t a very long way to go. But I think those experiences and then having gone through a period where I was	1
"Jada Pinkett Smith revealed she’s been dealing with “terrifying” hair loss after receiving questions from fans about why she’s been covering up her locks.    Smith, 46, opened up in Tuesday’s episode “Red Table Talk” on Facebook about undergoing several tests to determine why she’s been losing her hair. She said some professionals told her it was stress while others said she has alopecia, an autoimmune skin disease that causes hair loss.  “A lot of people have been asking why I’ve been wearing turbans,” Smith said. “Well, I haven’t talked about it. It’s not easy to talk about, but I am going to talk about it.”  JADA PINKETT SMITH'S DAUGHTER WILLOW REVEALS HER STRUGGLE WITH SELF-HARM: 'I WAS CUTTING MYSELF'  The actress recalled the “terrifying” moment when she was in the shower and “handfuls of hair” fell into her hands. She added that she loved her “big, thick beautiful hair.”  “Oh my God, am I going bald?” Smith recalled thinking.  She added, “It was one of those times in my life where I was literally shaking in fear. That’s why I cut my hair, and why I continue to cut it.”  Smith began sporting an asymmetrical bob in January and has kept her hair short since then. Her husband, Will Smith, also showed his support of the new do in an Instagram video at the time.  “My hair has been a big part of me,” she said. “Taking care of my hair has been a beautiful ritual and having the choice to have hair or not. And then one day to be like, ‘Oh my God, I might not have that choice anymore.’”  JADA PINKETT REGRETS DATING WILL SMITH WHILE HE WAS STILL MARRIED  Despite feeling scared, Smith said she put her hair problem into perspective.  “I really had to put it into a spiritual perspective, like the higher power takes so much from people. People are out here with cancer. People have sick children. I watch the higher power take things every day.” Smith said.  ""When I looked at it from that perspective it did settle me,"" she added.  Smith said she now loves wrapping her hair because it makes her feel “like a queen.”"	0
"Bethany Minelle, News Reporter  Prince Harry - the world's most eligible bachelor - and Hollywood starlet Meghan Markle are getting married.  Hundreds will attend. Millions will watch on television - including coverage on Sky News and Sky 1. The event will go down in history.  Sky News will broadcast live in Windsor the week before the wedding with all the build-up to the big day, with exclusive live coverage of the wedding in UHD in a special programme ‪from 9am to 3pm‬ on Sky News and Sky One ‪on Saturday 19 May.  Image: Prince Harry and Meghan announced their engagement to the public in November  The couple say they want it to be ""a big shared event"" that is ""modern, inclusive but still adhering to tradition"", and they want ""everyone"" to be part of their big day.  Advertisement  So what can we expect from the Royal wedding?  When?  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will get married on Saturday 19 May, at noon.  Guests will arrive between 9.30am and 11am, with members of the Royal family to turn up from 11.20am.  They will enter St George's Chapel via the Galilee Porch, some on foot and others by car, while Ms Markle and her mother will begin their journey from the bride's overnight location.  Image: Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby will marry the couple  Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby - who baptised Meghan in March - will officiate the service, which will take around an hour.  It will be televised from start to finish and will be followed by a carriage procession starting at 1pm and lasting for about half an hour.  When Harry met Meghan  The main part of the parade will pass along The Long Walk - a two-and-a-half mile (4km) path that links Windsor Castle with Snow Hill in Windsor Great Park.  The inspiration for the procession is believed to have come from the wedding of Prince Edward and the Countess of Wessex who got married at St George's chapel in 1999.  Where?  The couple will tie the knot on the High Altar of St George's Chapel, a 15th Century church on the grounds of Windsor Castle.  Image: The pair sought the Queen's permission to wed in George's Chapel  One of the first things they will hear as a married couple will be a fanfare from 20 silver-plated trumpets.  After the service, Prince Harry and Meghan will leave the chapel through the west entrance and embark on a carriage parade through the town.  Image: They make their vows on the on the High Altar of St George’s Chapel  The steps of the chapel will be lined by members of the Household Cavalry Mounted Regiment, and members of the Queen's Guard Windsor Castle will line the streets within Windsor Castle.  Bank holiday  Members of the Royal Family normally get married in the week, but as Prince Harry and Meghan are getting married on a Saturday, there won't be a bank holiday.  Image: The Diamond Jubilee in June 2012 was a bank holiday  Despite not getting a day off work, there is some good news for well-wishers - pubs will be open late over the wedding weekend.  The wedding falls on the same day as the FA Cup final at Wembley Stadium, but with the cup final not expected to kick off until around 5.30pm, it is unlikely to clash with the royal big day.  Pubs, bars and other licensed premises will be allowed to keep serving until 1am, instead of the usual 11pm, on the nights of Friday 18 May and the following night, after the wedding.  Security  The wedding operation will be ""amongst the largest in Thames Valley Police's history"", with up to 100,000 people expected on the streets.  Image: There was a heavy police presence for the wedding of Prince William and Kate  Measures will include barriers to prevent vehicle attacks, armed police patrols and airport-style security searches.  Police dogs, mounted police and the National Police Air Service will all be used in the run up to the wedding, and on the day itself visitors may be stopped and checked and British Transport Police will be patrolling train stations and carriages.

​Kendall Jenner and Shay Mitchell are incredibly influential fashion icons on Instagram who show us styles we never tried, heard of, or could think of. This time, they're bringing us something done before, but seemingly way in the past: retro bathing suits.      Last week, Kendall ​posted a photo on Instagram wearing a yellow bikini with a front tie and high-waited bottoms, a stylish look she was promoting from her own clothing line she runs with her sister ​Kylie Jenner, Kendall + Kylie Swim.  Shay post a pic with a similar bikini. Her top, even more reminiscent of ​​retro fashion, had a similar cut bottom.  While both tops are incredibly flattering, with a style that's slowly been making its way back to pop culture, the high-rise bottoms are most interesting to me. The cut makes legs seem longer and curves seem more defined.      This is a look that will most definitely be copied, just in time for summer!	1
"Kim Kardashian West, whose 17-hour transformation from brunette to platinum blond made headlines pretty much everywhere, has done it again. On Sunday she took to social media to announce her newest shade: a bright, bright, bright pink.  We had a hint something was coming on Saturday, when she basically sounded an alarm for a future color drop: ""I can't even tell you how over my blond hair I am!"" she tweet-raged. (As someone who is a very much dyed platinum blond too, I can attest that we all have those days.)  Kardashian West, however, did something about it. A big something. Although she hinted that she was a ""brunette at heart"" during a Create + Cultivate panel on Saturday, she definitely didn't go back to her roots with her recent dye job. Instead, she went bold—and it's pretty great.  Judging by the multiple reveal posts, she's excited about it too.  As for those of us wondering—quite rightly, given younger sis Kylie Jenner's former penchant for mixing up her look with wigs—if the look is indeed a wig, temporary, or permanent, Kim put down any confusion on Twitter before it could begin. ""I wonder if it’s just a wig or permanent color? because we know Kim doesn’t play with wigs,"" one user posited.  ""I don’t really do wigs,"" she replied. ""It’s real.""  Her stylist's Instagram backs it up: After news broke of the dye job on Sunday, her hair colorist, Chris Appleton, posted a photo of the dye in process on his 'gram (and that definitely looks like some Olaplex in the background). ""New look who dis?"" he captioned the pic.  Kim is pink, Kris is blond, Kylie has a $1.4 million push present—and we're all just still trying to keep up with those Kardashians.

Having stayed in touch on- and-off over the years since their shock split in 2005, the couple have taken their friendship to a new level following the actor’s break-up with Angelina Jolie in 2016 – and Brad’s camp are officially confirming reports of a reconciliation with Jen.  ‘[Brad and Jen] have connected and are in fact in touch,’ a source close to Brad told Gossip Cop, describing the initial reaching out as ‘friendly communications’.  Now, with reports claiming Brad’s divorce to Angelina is on the verge of being finalised, insiders tell New Idea it is all systems go for Brad, 54, and Jen, 49, to move forward – with insiders tipping the former couple will choose the Oscars for their big reveal.	1
Gigi Hadid seems to have it all figured out. The three-time Vogue cover girl is living her best life, and has the boyfriend, career, and jet-setting social life to prove it. But if Hadid knows the secrets to happiness and success, she’s not shy about sharing them, and at the Gramercy offices of her agency IMG Models, she took on a spirited game of 73 Questions, offering up practical advice (never cut your own bangs before a campaign shoot), trade secrets (even supermodels fall asleep in their makeup), and even a Taylor Swift playlist.  There is, of course, more to Hadid than what’s on her Instagram feed, and here she provides insight into exactly how a model makes the move from bit player to superstar. First step: Listen to your parents. “If you’re not the nicest, most hardworking girl in the industry, there’s going to be someone prettier, nicer, and more hardworking,” says Hadid, sharing a piece of advice picked up from mom, Yolanda. Niceness isn’t something Hadid has to fake, but the vampy characters she portrays in editorials require a Sasha Fierce–esque alter ego—and plenty of on-set chips and guac.  Poring through her portfolio with manager Luiz Mattos, Hadid describes landing covers for the American, British, French, and Italian editions of Vogue as a career highlight: For her, nothing—not even getting her own Barbie—has compared to the thrill of joining a club that includes Christy Turlington, Linda Evangelista, and Kate Moss.  And although her millennial-Barbie moments and off-duty style make her a paparazzi magnet, even Hadid has fashion role models she looks up to: She says she wouldn’t mind raiding Rihanna’s or the Olsen twins’ wardrobes. As for her own closet, a peek inside is likely to reveal plenty of runway fashion alongside sporty gear like Kobe Bryant jerseys and equestrian pieces left over from her days as a competitive horseback rider.  Though Hadid is quick with a witty answer on nearly every subject, there are a few things she’d rather keep to herself: She demurs, for instance, when it comes time to pick her favorite tattoo on her boyfriend Zayn Malik’s body. Of course, every supermodel needs to maintain a bit of mystery—and besides, with her cover-starring streak showing no signs of slowing, there’s always the next round.	1
Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Bridget Marquardt was once the girlfriend of Hugh Hefner and the star of E!’s hit reality TV series, “The Girls Next Door,” but the Playboy pinup told Australia’s “The Morning Show” Monday that she hasn’t heard from her ex in years.  “He told me there was always an open door, but I heard that that’s not quite true lately,” explained the 43-year-old model. “I called and tried to go to the mansion earlier this year… but I’m just getting the run around.”  However, things weren’t always this way between Marquardt and the 91-year-old magazine mogul. She said the two stayed in touch “for a while” after she left the mansion in 2009.  “I was still going back to some of the parties. Occasionally, my boyfriend [Nick Carpenter] and I would go back,” she said. “I was still in touch with Hef — and then we kind of lost contact.”  A rep for Hefner did not immediately return Fox News’ request for comment. He married 31-year-old Playmate Crystal Harris in 2012.  Marquardt has also been dealing with other personal woes. The model received unwanted news after she and Carpenter thawed her eggs, which she had frozen nine years ago.  “None of my eggs survived,” she admitted. “It was devastating for me. All this time I thought I had an amazing insurance policy, but it didn’t work out. I thought I was doing the smart thing and the right thing, and I do still think it was. It just didn’t work out for me.”	1

"American comedian  Colin Kelly Jost[1] ( , born June 29, 1982)[1][2] is an American comedian, actor, and writer. He has been a writer for Saturday Night Live since 2005 and ""Weekend Update"" writer since 2014. He also served as one of the show's co-head writers from 2012 to 2015, and came back as one of the show's head writers in 2017.[3][4][5][6]  Early life [ edit ]  Colin Jost was born and raised in the Grymes Hill[7] neighborhood of Staten Island, New York, the elder of two boys. [8][9][10] He has one brother, Casey Jost, who had a role in Staten Island Summer and is a writer for Impractical Jokers.[11] His mother, Kerry J. Kelly, was the chief medical officer[12] for the New York City Fire Department, and his father, Daniel A. Jost, is a former teacher at Staten Island Technical High School.[13][14] Jost was raised Roman Catholic. He attended Regis High School in Manhattan, where he was the editor of the school newspaper The Owl,[11] and Harvard University,[8] where he was president of the Harvard Lampoon.[9][15] During his freshman year there, he lived in Greenough Hall.  Career [ edit ]  While at Harvard, Jost won $5,250 on a college edition of Weakest Link. After graduation, he was hired as a writer at NBC's Saturday Night Live (SNL) in 2005[8].  From 2009 to 2012, Jost was SNL's writing supervisor. He was co-head writer from 2012 to 2015, and regained that status in late 2017.[16] He often collaborates with fellow SNL co-head writer Rob Klein.[17] During the summer hiatus following the 2012–13 season, executive producer Lorne Michaels asked Jost if he could do the ""Weekend Update"" feature,[8] as co-anchor Seth Meyers would soon be leaving to host Late Night With Seth Meyers. Jost accepted and replaced Meyers on the March 1, 2014, episode.[18]  Jost names Norm Macdonald as a primary influence for his ""Update"" anchor work, as Macdonald's tone was the one Jost grew up with in high school. He also names Tina Fey as an influence.[8] In addition to Weekend Update, Jost made a brief cameo appearance as Ohio Governor John Kasich in a Republican presidential debate sketch.[19]  As a stand-up comedian, Jost has appeared on Late Night With Jimmy Fallon as well as on TBS and HBO.[20] He was selected as a ""New Face"" at the Montreal Just for Laughs festival in 2009,[21] and has since appeared at the Chicago Just for Laughs festival in 2011 and 2012 and the Montréal festival in 2010 and 2012. Jost has published three ""Shouts and Murmurs"" pieces in The New Yorker magazine, in addition to writing for The New York Times Magazine, The Huffington Post, The Staten Island Advance and Radar.[22] Jost wrote the screenplay of and played a minor role in the 2015 comedy film Staten Island Summer. He also had a minor role as Paul in the 2016 romcom feature How to Be Single.[23]  In late 2018, Jost and Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers appeared in an advertising campaign for Izod.[24]  Jost, along with Michael Che, appeared on the March 4, 2019 episode of WWE's Monday Night Raw, where both were announced as special correspondents for WrestleMania 35 on April 7. That same episode, they got involved in a storyline with wrestler Braun Strowman, eventually resulting in both Jost and Che becoming participants in the André the Giant Memorial Battle Royal at WrestleMania.[25][26] At the event, Jost and Che went under the ring for the majority of the match, and then tried to eliminate Strowman while he was trying to do the same to the Hardy Boyz. Jost attempted to calm the situation by using his therapist, but Strowman chokeslammed him and eliminated the comedians in quick succession, winning the battle royal.[27]  Personal life [ edit ]  Jost began a relationship with actress Scarlett Johansson in May 2017.[28] It was confirmed in May 2019 that Jost and Johansson were engaged.[29]  Jost was involved in controversy in April 2019 when Uproxx writer Steven Hyden published an article detailing the public backlash against him.[30] This caused his We"	1

"“Orange Is the New Black” actress Jamie Denbo has taken to Twitter to call out sexism in Hollywood.  “I was just informed that at the age of 43, I am TOO OLD to play the wife of a 57 year old,” Denbo, who plays a Jewish inmate at Litchfield Penitentiary named Ginsberg on the Netflix series, wrote in a series of tweets. “The real wife of the 57 year-old actor is EASILY AT LEAST 50. But this fucker wants to be tv married to a 38 year-old -TOPS.”  Though she declined to reveal the identity of the male actor or to specify which project she was talking about, she did note that the two characters have an 18-year-old daughter in the script.

Denbo’s story is similar to one shared by Maggie Gyllenhaal in an interview with TheWrap in 2015. Gyllenhaal described having been, at the age of 37, deemed too old to play the love interest of a 55-year-old man.  “There are things that are really disappointing about being an actress in Hollywood that surprise me all the time,” she said. “I’m 37 and I was told recently I was too old to play the lover of a man who was 55. It was astonishing to me. It made me feel bad, and then it made me feel angry, and then it made me laugh.”  Also Read: Bill O'Reilly Accused of Racism, Sexism Over Maxine Walters, James Brown Diss (Video)  Denbo’s initial tweets were largely met with support, but others haven’t been so kind. Denbo shot back at her critics on Monday with yet another tweet.  “Happy to report it took over 48 hours for the trolls to start harassing this ‘spoiled, ugly, libtard actress,'” she wrote. “Step up your game boys!”  Read all of her tweets below:  I was just informed that at the age of 43, I am TOO OLD to play the wife of a 57 year old. — Jamie Denbo (@jamiedenbo) May 4, 2017  Oh, the characters also have an 18 year-old daughter.

The real reason Angelina Jolie hasn't been on the big screen recently  Angelina Jolie has been gracing the big screen for over two decades. From Girl, Interrupted to Mr. & Mrs. Smith, from Lara Croft: Tomb Raider to Wanted, and from Changeling to Maleficent, she's established herself as an icon within pop culture history through a wide range of roles. Over the span of her impressive career, this multi-hyphenate has become one of Hollywood's highest-paid actresses and has boasted a number of accolades, including an Academy Award, two Screen Actors Guild Awards, and three Golden Globes.  While the movie star has continued to keep busy, we have to admit she's been pretty quiet lately. From health scares and a busy family life to humanitarian work and taking on roles behind the scenes, there's actually a lot about Jolie's life and career that even her most devoted fans may have missed since she last appeared on film.  So, let's answer the question on everyone's mind: what's the real reason Jolie hasn't been on the big screen recently?	1
"Two former partners of Chip Gaines in the creation of the Magnolia Real Estate Company are suing the “Fixer Upper” star for fraud, claiming that Gaines bought them out without telling them that HGTV had decided to broadcast the show nationally “and that the show prominently featured the ‘Magnolia’ brand name.”  (Photo by Neal Klaeser)  In the 24-page lawsuit filed Wednesday in state district court in Waco, Gaines’s two former partners, lawyers John L. Lewis and Richard L. Clark, are seeking more than $1 million in damages and non-monetary relief, as well.  Gaines’ spokesman declined to comment on the suit, but his attorney, Jordan Mayfield, told KWTX Thursday, “We are confident that these claims will be found to be meritless, and it is disappointing to see people try to take advantage of the hard work and success of Chip and Joanna Gaines.""  Lewis and Clark were equal partners with Gaines in founding the Magnolia Real Estate Company in 2007.  The suit says that for the first six years, the company largely operated in Waco with a single real estate agent.  The suit claims Gaines worked out a deal with HGTV for the “Fixer Upper” program without telling his partners and that Gaines planned on featuring the Magnolia brand name.  Gaines bought their shares of Magnolia Real estate for $2,500 each, the suit says.  ""With this insider information in hand, Chip Gaines convinced plaintiffs to sell their membership interests in Magnolia Realty quickly to him before a public announcement that “Fixer Upper” was picked up by HGTV.""  The suit, which also names Magnolia Realty, Scripps Networks Interactive, Scripps networks LLC and High Noon Entertainment which produces the show, claims Gaines pressured Lewis and Clark to sell “before they discovered the company’s value was radically enhanced by ‘Fixer Upper.’”  When Clark balked at the terms of the buyout, the suit alleges Gaines sent a text advising Lewis to tell Clark “to be careful.”  “I don’t come from the nerdy prep school he’s from. And when people talk to me that way they get their asses kicked. And if he’s not ready to do that he better shut his mouth. I’m not the toughest guy there is, but I can assure you that would not end well for [R]ick,” the text read, according to the suit.  Since the show debuted, the suit says, Magnolia has grown from a single-agent firm to one that employs “over 93 real estate agents, and a support staff, and now operates in nearly every major city in Texas.”  In addition to monetary damages, the suit seeks rescission of the sale of the company or fair value for Lewis’ and Clark’s interest, payment of salaries, bonuses in-kind benefits and distributions they would have received as partners"	1

The youngest daughter of 1976 Summer Olympics decathlon winner Bruce Jenner (now Caitlyn Jenner) and TV personality Kris Jenner,[18] she has an older sister, Kendall. On Kris's side of the family, she has three older half-sisters, Kourtney, Kim and Khloé Kardashian, and one older half-brother, Rob.

When I spoke to Gina Rodriguez on a recent Wednesday night, I was still pumped from attending a press screening of her latest movie, Annihilation , earlier that day (a fact that Rodriguez met with delighted laughter, admitting that even she hadn’t seen it yet). I have very high standards for sci-fi and horror films—I expect to startle and gasp and cover my eyes—and this movie didn’t just clear my very high bar; it vaulted over it. But to be honest, even if it had failed to register on my scare-o-meter, I would have loved it for what it is at its heart: in Rodriguez’s words, “a human story and…bad bitches going into action.”  In the film, which lands in theaters nationwide on Friday, February 23, Rodriguez plays Anya Thorensen, a paramedic who has volunteered to explore The Shimmer, a mystifying, dangerous, ever-expanding territory. Those who go into The Shimmer often don’t return.  Venturing into the force field alongside Anya are women toting guns, ammo, and advanced degrees in STEM: biologist Lena (Natalie Portman), physicist Josie (Tessa Thompson), geologist Cass (Tuva Novotny), and psychologist Dr. Ventress (Jennifer Jason Leigh). Together, they’re determined to do what practically no one else has: enter The Shimmer, discover what it is, and return unscathed.  The role fit Rodriguez like Anya’s well-worn fatigues. “The classic roles that are afforded to me— here, Gina, this is what you’re capable of doing —are usually roles I don’t even relate to,” she says, explaining that she identifies more with layered parts like the main character in Lady Bird than with parts inscribed by one-dimensional Latina stereotypes. Playing Anya? “It felt like butter.”  Share via Pinterest Nadya Wasylko. Wardrobe Styling by Shibon Kennedy. Makeup by Carissa Ferreri with Tracey Mattingly.

Maybe that’s because the film could be a metaphor for her life for the last several years: Flanked by her own support squad, Rodriguez has marched headlong into a forbidding reality of chronic illness and come out stronger and bolder than ever. As she asserts her power in her personal life and her career, battling forces that, like The Shimmer, loom large and seemingly beyond her control, she is fighting not just for herself, but for other women in Hollywood and beyond, forging for them a path forward and up.  Rodriguez, 33, has Hashimoto’s disease, an autoimmune condition that wages war on the thyroid gland , which produces hormones that influence how your body uses energy. Hashimoto’s can lead to an underactive thyroid that doesn’t produce enough of these hormones, and symptoms can be devastating and wide-ranging, including fatigue , joint pain, memory issues, and weight gain , to name a few.  “To the core of my being, I know what it’s like to feel like there is no way I can win this, so where do I even begin?”  At first, Rodriguez says, Hashimoto’s felt like “the curse of a lifetime,” especially in an industry that places so much emphasis on size. The disease, though treatable, has no cure. For years after being diagnosed with hypothyroidism at 19 and Hashimoto’s at 26, and putting on weight that wouldn’t budge, Rodriguez preferred to deny what she was going through rather than focus her efforts on doing whatever she could to feel better. “To the core of my being, I know what it’s like to feel like there is no way I can win this, so where do I even begin,” she reflects.  She tried to rebel against what she knew her body needed by not taking her medicine on time, eating foods that she knew would make her feel terrible (looking at you, dairy), or deciding working out wasn’t worth it if it wouldn’t change her body. Eventually, she realized something had to give: “[Hashimoto’s] affects so many aspects of your life. I’ve had it for so many years…that rebellion of not taking care of myself can’t exist anymore.”  Share via Pinterest 	1
"American actress and singer  Naturi Cora Maria Naughton (born May 20, 1984)[1] is an American actress and singer-songwriter. Naughton is best known as one-third of the R&B group 3LW and for her acting roles in Fame, Notorious, where she played Lil' Kim, and The Playboy Club. Naughton was a series regular in season one of the Lifetime television drama series The Client List as Kendra. Naughton stars in the Starz drama Power as Tasha St. Patrick.  Early life and education [ edit ]  Naughton was born and raised in East Orange, New Jersey,[1] the daughter of Brenda, a part-time paralegal, and Ezra Naughton, a retired accountant.[2][3] Her musical talent emerged at the age of five years, when she joined her church choir at New Hope Baptist Church (the same church where Whitney Houston performed in her youth) in Newark, New Jersey. She attended St. Joseph's Catholic school and Immaculate Conception High School in Montclair, New Jersey. She has sung the national anthem at various events in New Jersey and attended Seton Hall University.[4]  Career [ edit ]  3LW [ edit ]  In 1999, at age 15, Naughton joined Adrienne Bailon and Kiely Williams to form the group 3LW. Their first single, ""No More (Baby I'ma Do Right)"", was released in the fall of 2000. ""No More"" was a success and was followed by the second single, ""Playas Gon' Play"" in early 2001. The group's debut album, 3LW, was released on December 5, 2000. The album went platinum, selling 1.3 million copies in the U.S. In the summer of 2001, the group went on the MTV TRL tour along with Destiny's Child, Dream, Nelly, Eve, and Jessica Simpson.  3LW spent the first half of 2002 in the studio, recording an album tentatively titled Same Game, Different Rules. The album and its intended lead single ""Uh Oh"" were presented to the label, who felt it did not have enough urban radio appeal. The tracks from Same Game, Different Rules were leaked to the Internet in MP3 format, and Epic considered dropping the band. A fan support campaign for 3LW named 'Never Let Go of 3LW' followed, and the act was retained. Recording a new set of tracks, 3LW returned in the summer of 2002 with the P. Diddy-produced single ""I Do (Wanna Get Close To You)"", featuring Loon.  By August 2002, the group was set to release its newest LP, A Girl Can Mack, when Naughton announced that she was no longer a member of the group. Naughton says that the other two girls and their management had forced her out.[5] The problems reached a breaking point after a heated argument with Williams, Bailon, and their manager, which allegedly ended with Williams throwing a hot plate full of KFC food at Naughton. Epic Records then ended their relationship with both 3LW and Naughton. Despite Naughton's departure both Bailon and Williams resumed as a duo for a short amount of time and later Jessica Benson became Naughton's replacement. The group has since disbanded. In May 2017, she reunited with former groupmate Bailon on the daytime talk show The Real, who promoted the season premiere of Power.[6]  Solo work [ edit ]  Naughton at H-E-B Holiday Parade 2009  Naughton recorded five tracks for the Fame soundtrack which was released on August 25, 2009.[7] The following month Naughton scored her first solo chart entry ever with her cover of Fame peaking at No. 33 on the UK Singles Chart. The single also reached the Top 20 in Finland, Portugal and Norway.[8] In 2010 an extended play was released titled Fame Presents Naturi Naughton as Denise: Didn't I Tell You. The EP included tracks already heard before as well as previously unreleased tracks.[9][10]  In February 2010, when appearing on the BET talk show The Mo'Nique Show, Naughton expressed interest in recording a solo-debut album. However, Naughton has revealed she is instead focusing on her acting career but has not ruled out an album. An ensemble of demos have leaked to the internet, including a duet with Lil' Kim. However, it is unknown whether or not they will be released on her debut album. "	1
"Catelynn Lowell Baltierra might not have been able to be with her firstborn daughter, Carly, this Christmas, but she was surely in the 8-year-old's heart.  The 25-year-old Teen Mom OG cast member just returned home from six weeks of treatment Saturday, where she reunited with husband Tyler Baltierra and daughter Novalee, 2, after revealing in November she was experiencing suicidal thoughts.  On Sunday, Baltierra shared a photo of a tag from a Christmas gift from her first daughter with the handwritten message, ""To Catelynn, from Carly, love you Merry Christmas.""  Most precious thing ever!! ?❤️❤️ A post shared by Catelynn Lowell (@catelynnmtv) on Dec 31, 2017 at 7:33am PST  The MTV cast member and Tyler welcomed daughter Carly in 2009 on 16 and Pregnant, but decided to place her up for adoption. The couple has had limited contact with their biological daughter since then, but it's clear the message from the 8-year-old meant a lot to Baltierra.  ""Most precious thing ever!!"" she captioned the photo with a crying emoji and two hearts.  On this season of Teen Mom OG, Baltierra and Tyler have had trouble reconciling their desire to see their firstborn daughter and their relationship with her adoptive parents.  “I try not to make it difficult. Things always seem like they’re difficult and I’m not trying to make it difficult. I’m willing and trying and offering. And then I get ignored for months and I try. And then she finally answers me,” Baltierra said of her daughter's adoptive mother in a recent episode.  “I feel like I get punished because my kid asks questions about me, or she wants to know where she comes from,” she continued. “What [did they] think adoption is? She’s going to do that.”  Baltierra has been open about her problems with anxiety and depression in the past, entering treatment after the birth of Novalee for postpartum depression.  “I’m doing very well. Two years out, you know, since birth, so I’m doing — I actually feel really good, I do. I had a panic attack this morning, but I worked through it. It’s just knowing the things that you have to do to work through it. But yeah, I’m doing way better,” she said in April.  Photo credit: MTV"	1

Friendship goals! Sarah Silverman received a hilarious gift from Kate Beckinsale after revealing that she had ended her relationship with Michael Sheen.  Beckinsale, who dated the Passengers actor in the ‘90s, gave Silverman blue and white M&Ms with a photo of Silverman kissing Sheen on the cheek to help her through the breakup. “Been ending every night with a microwaved bowl of personalized m&ms given to me by the very thoughtful and very cruel @katebeckinsale to remind me that I’m alone in this world. So very alone,” Silverman wrote along with an Instagram photo of the sweet treats on Wednesday, February 7.  The comedienne added: “THANKS, KATE. Seriously they are so good esp. melted which is why the microwave.”  Beckinsale, 44, shares 19-year-old daughter Lily Mo Sheen with the actor, but the exes remain close friends. She’s also established a friendship with Silverman, 47, through the years.  As previously reported, Silverman announced on Monday, February 5, that she and Sheen, 49, split after nearly four years of dating. “The great @michaelsheen & I consciously uncoupled over Christmas. I mean, not ‘over Christmas’ — like that wasn’t the fight that ended it,” Silverman tweeted. “No fight. We just live in different countries & it got hard. Felt we should just tell y’all so u stop askin, ‘How’s Michael/How’s Sarah?’”  Hours later, she joked about accidentally revealing their breakup on his birthday. “The joke here is I just realized I posted our breakup tweet on his actual birthday and I can’t believe what a dick I am,” she tweeted. “Can u believe it?? He said I wasn’t THOUGHTFUL,” she continued. “Jerk… Anyway, Happy Birthday, Michael…”  Us Weekly first confirmed in February 2014 that they were a couple. Prior to her relationship with Sheen, Silverman dated Jimmy Kimmel for five years. Sheen, meanwhile, dated Beckinsale from 1995 to 2003 and actress Rachel McAdams from 2010 to 2013.	1

For the British jazz, rock and house music singer, see Juliet Roberts  American actress and producer  Julia Fiona Roberts (born October 28, 1967)[1] is an American actress and producer. She established herself as a leading lady in Hollywood after headlining the romantic comedy film Pretty Woman (1990), which grossed $464 million worldwide. She has won three Golden Globe Awards, from eight nominations, and has been nominated for four Academy Awards for her film acting, winning the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance in Erin Brockovich (2000).  Her films have collectively brought box office receipts of over US$2.8 billion, making her one of the most bankable actresses in Hollywood.[2] Her most successful films include Mystic Pizza (1988), Steel Magnolias (1989), Pretty Woman (1990), Sleeping with the Enemy (1991), The Pelican Brief (1993), My Best Friend's Wedding (1997), Notting Hill (1999), Runaway Bride (1999), Erin Brockovich (2000), Ocean's Eleven (2001), Ocean's Twelve (2004), Charlie Wilson's War (2007), Valentine's Day (2010), Eat Pray Love (2010), Money Monster (2016), and Wonder (2017). Roberts was nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Limited Series or Movie for her performance in the HBO television film The Normal Heart (2014). In 2018, she starred in the Prime Video psychological thriller series Homecoming.  Roberts was the highest-paid actress in the world throughout most of the 1990s[3][4] and in the first half of the 2000s.[5] Her fee for 1990's Pretty Woman was US$300,000;[6] in 2003, she was paid an unprecedented $25 million for her role in Mona Lisa Smile (2003). As of 2017 , Roberts's net worth was estimated to be $170 million.[7] People magazine has named her the most beautiful woman in the world a record five times.[8]  Early life and family  Roberts was born on October 28, 1967, in Smyrna, Georgia,[1][9] to Betty Lou Bredemus (1934–2015) and Walter Grady Roberts (1933–1977).[1][9][10] She is of English, Scottish, Irish, Welsh, German, and Swedish descent.[11][12] Her father was a Baptist, her mother a Roman Catholic,[13] and she was raised Catholic.[14][15] Her older brother Eric Roberts (b. 1956), from whom she was estranged for several years until 2004, older sister Lisa Roberts Gillan (b. 1965), and niece Emma Roberts, are also actors.

She’s a professional.""  ""I love her to death,"" she continued. ""Her private life she keeps pretty much to herself. She comes to work and gets the job done. She’s got a big smile on her face and she’s getting through it.""  Faris and Pratt sent the Internet into a tailspin when they announced that they'd be ending their marriage after eight years earlier this month. ""Anna and I are sad to announce we are legally separating. We tried hard for a long time, and we’re really disappointed,"" the couple said in a statement.  RELATED: Chris Pratt Takes Son Jack to Church After Split From Anna Faris  Anna also thanked fans for their support. ""Hey, dear listeners: I just want to thank you all so much for all the love I’ve been receiving, and I truly love you,"" she said in a podcast. ""Life is too short to be in relationships where you feel this isn’t fully right or somebody doesn’t have your back, or somebody doesn’t fully value you,” she said. “Don’t be afraid to feel your independence if things aren’t right."""	1
"Brendon Urie is 31. Yes, that Brendon Urie. The guy who only needs a smudge of eyeliner to incite mass hysteria. The guy whose first ever single — a highly complex song depicting a broken wedding, featuring robust characters and full dialogue —went four times platinum (he was 17). The guy who thought he was too cool for a young Alexa Chung. The guy who became an LGBTQ inspiration without ever openly identifying as queer (there's a entire Instagram account dedicated to notes of gratitude to the singer from fans). The guy who, despite being the last remaining member of cult band Panic! At the Disco, has managed to flourish the better part of 15 years in the industry. Do you feel inadequate? You probably should.  Panic! At The Disco was never supposed to be Urie's. He was just drug-dealing, fornicating, weed-smoking Mormon kid, growing up eight minutes from the Las Vegas strip (he had his first threesome at 16, an event that inspired what has since become bisexual anthem ""Girls/Girls/Boys""). When the high school junior heard that the cool kids, a rag-tag group of pubescent boys calling themselves ""Panic! At The Disco"" were in need of a temporary guitar player, he seized the opportunity.  Urie quickly learned these kids were for real, they wanted to make it, and they needed the multi-instrumentalist's multi-octave tenor vocals to reach the next level. Their first foray into shows were performances at the local Mormon church (mama Urie would not let them take the stage without long pants and collared-shirts). On a whim, they sent demos to a recently signed-bassist, who was in the midst of creating his own debut album with a group of talented Chicago natives under the name Fall Out Boy. Pete Wentz drove to Vegas to meet with the teens personally. And then came ""I Write Sins Not Tragedies"" — affectionately abbreviated by Urie and fans to ""Sins.""  Six albums later, Urie is still larger-than-life. He is known for his phenomenal stage presence (which earned a stint on Broadway in Cyndi Lauper's Kinky Boots last year), something which, surprisingly, translates interpersonally, too. He was more jaded at 19 — a baby-faced pop punk idol with misguidedly long side-burns — in a now infamous interview with Alexa Chung, than he is 11 years on. Swigging a beer, he regales with anecdotes about the early years, his perfect, James Dean-esque quiff lightly swaying as he delicately vacillates between topics ranging from the serious to the surreal. It's obvious from the onset that Urie is a premier conversationalist, and he has opinions. No publicist hovers as Urie addresses his own #MeToo moments, his sexuality, his thoughts on politics, religion, or Aziz Ansari. They don't need to — Urie knows exactly who he is, and he's not going anywhere.  ""I Write Sins Not Tragedies"" is a weird track. It opens with a harpsichord (not your traditional alt-rock instrument), before using crashing drums, and distorted guitar to navigate infidelity, and the fickleness of human nature. It was remarkably cynical and intellectual for a group of teens, and set the chaotic tone for all Panic!'s future output — even as each member, save Urie, eventually departed. But alt-rock was in, Greenday, My Chemical Romance and Death Cab reigned, and Panic! At The Disco had brought something new to the conversation: narrative. Even over a decade on, the Urie-led band's latest project employs the same technique, no doubt a contributing factor to it shooting straight to number one on the Billboard Hot 200 upon its debut. Despite numerous opportunities, Urie never broke away from Panic! At The Disco to create his own brand; to the singer, Panic! is unfiltered, Panic! is fanatical (as are its followers), Panic! is freedom.  Shirt by Land of Distraction  Pop was such a different landscape when Panic! came out. Fall Out Boy, Gym Class Heroes, My Chemical Romance, Green Day. That was pop music. What was it about emo-rock that you think connected?  I honestly don't know, but I'm so glad it di"	1

Brandi Glanville sparked speculation that she was throwing shade at her ex-husband, Eddie Cibrian, and his wife, LeAnn Rimes, with her Halloween costume.  The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum, 44, shared a photo of herself and boyfriend Donald Friese dressed up for a Halloween party on Friday, October 27. The former reality star wore denim overalls with a black tube top, as well as a cowgirl hat, while her date wore a black button-down shirt and gray jeans. She captioned the photo, ”Soooo my friends Halloween party was celebrity scandal couples! Guess who we are,” alongside laughing emojis.  Soooo my friends Halloween party was celebrity scandal couples! Guess who we are 😆😆😆😂😂😂😂😆😂 A post shared by Brandi Glanville (@brandiglanville) on Oct 27, 2017 at 2:47pm PDT  Fans assumed that the pair were dressed up as Cibrian and Rimes and quickly took to the Brandi Glanville Unfiltered host’s social media accounts to share their opinions. One woman wrote, “You need to get over it already and move on. Stop sweatin them. I always see you talking about her and never her about you,” while another tweeted, “You made your ‘boyfriend’ dress up as your ex?? How humiliating for him.”  Others found the costumes playful and amusing, with one writing, “Hahaha! This is epic! From tragedy to comedy! You rock girl!!!”  The Drinking and Tweeting author has famously feuded with her ex and Rimes ever since Cibrian cheated on her with the “How Do I Live Without You” singer while filming Lifetime’s Northern Lights. Glanville and her husband of nine years divorced in 2010 and share custody of their two sons, Mason, 14, and Jake, 10.  Their on again-off again feud exploded recently when Glanville took a jab at the couple in a video promo for U.K.’s Celebrity Big Brother, saying, “My ex-husband is an actor and he married a c–t — ry music star, LeAnn Rimes, after they cheated together, and they’re happy.”  Not all of Glanville’s followers assumed her costume was a diss towards her ex: others guessed that Glanville and Friese were dressed up as Nick Lachey and Jessica Simpson.	1
"Here are all of the reasons new baby prince of Cambridge is more significant than just 'another spare'  Only last summer, Duchess Kate of Cambridge was heard telling someone about having ""more babies"" and everyone thought she was just joking. She wasn't: That September, the palace confirmed she was expecting her third royal baby. Kate, 36, gave birth to a boy Monday, who came in at a healthy 8 pounds, 7 ounces.  Here are some of the reasons why this matters:  The succession: The new prince alters the line for the throne. He is now fifth behind sister Princess Charlotte of Cambridge, 2, brother Prince George of Cambridge, 4, father Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, 35, and grandfather Prince Charles, 68, the Prince of Wales and Queen Elizabeth II's eldest son.  With George and Charlotte as their generation's ""heir and spare,"" the new baby becomes another spare but in a new era of recent changes in succession law that make royal birth order more important than gender.  So the baby prince (royal fans began immediately speculating about names), will follow Charlotte not jump ahead of her. And if it had been another girl, she would not lose her place to a younger brother who might follow.  Uncle Prince Harry, 33, moves down to sixth in line, while great-uncle Prince Andrew, the queen's second son, moves down to seventh. His daughters, Princess Beatrice and Eugenie, move down to eighth and ninth respectively, and the queen's youngest son, Prince Edward, moves to 10th.  The memory of Diana: No one would have been more thrilled about another baby than Diana, a woman described by her sons as a wonderful mum who had a special rapport with children. During the weeks of mourning following commemoration of her death, happy pictures of her with her sons were everywhere. People recalled she first came to public attention before her engagement to Prince Charles was announced in 1981 as a London nanny and, in a famous picture, as a nursery school aide clutching toddlers to her hips.  A new baby may have been coincidental but it was an apt reminder that life goes on, turning the page on a new chapter for the royal family and for the Cambridges in particular.  Following the queen's lead: Will and Kate may be on their way to imitating his grandparents in family size, which would make them relative rarities as royal heirs.  The queen, 92, and Prince Philip, 96, have four children, but aside from them, no others in the close line of succession have had more than two kids. The birth order of Will and Kate's children follows that of the Queen's children too: boy, girl, boy. The queen's grandfather, King George V, who died in 1936, had six children.  Prince George: The nation's favorite 4-year-old started school at Thomas's Battersea last fall, a milestone his mother had to miss due to a recurrence of her acute morning sickness with Baby No. 3. Prince William accompanied him, followed by a small press pool in hopes avoiding a repeat of the mob scenes that surrounded Will and Harry's first days of school with Diana back in the 1980s.  Acute morning sickness explained: What is hyperemesis gravidarum?  Prince Harry: He's thrilled about the new baby. Soon after the announcement, during a visit to Manchester, he was asked about the new heir and told reporters, ""Fantastic. Great. Very, very happy for them.""  Although he moves down further in the succession, Harry was still required by law to get the permission of the queen to marry American actress Meghan Markle, 36, on May 19 at Windsor Castle. (The 245-year-old law that required all royals to get the monarch's permission changed in 2013 to include only the first six in line.)  Prince Andrew: The new baby means the Duke of York, the 58-year-old second son of the queen and Prince Philip, no longer has to get the queen's permission to remarry — even if he and his ex-wife, Sarah Ferguson, the Duchess of York, get hitched again. The two are still close, sharing the same royal mansion for years even though the"	0
    Sanaa Lathan doesn’t want any involvement in the #WhoBitBeyoncé scandal. The Love & Basketball star opened up in a new interview about the rumors that she was the actress who bit Beyoncé ’s face at a party in December 2017.  “I think it’s the most absurd thing I’ve ever been involved with,” Lathan, 46, said in her June 2018 cover story for Health magazine. “Thank God I’ve been in this business for 20 years and have had so many rumors about me. They used to devastate me in my 20s, but in order to survive in this business, you just have to let it roll.”  The Affair star insisted that she would never have the audacity to do such a thing to Queen Bey, 36, because she is just one of the “Formation” singer’s many fans.  “I adore Beyoncé,” she added. “I would never do anything malicious like that — to her, or to anyone. It’s so bizarre. I thought it was the funniest thing ever that it was a news story. It’s so crazy.”  As previously reported, Tiffany Haddish first revealed in an interview with GQ in March that an unnamed actress bit Beyoncé. “Near the end of the party, Beyoncé’s at the bar, so I said to Beyoncé, ‘Did she really bite you?’ She was like, ‘Yeah,’” the Girls Trip actress, 38, recalled to the magazine. “I was like, ‘She gonna get her ass beat tonight.’ She was like, ‘Tiffany, no. Don’t do that. That bitch is on drugs. She not even drunk. The bitch is on drugs. She not like that all the time. Just chill.’”  Lathan was one of the first actresses to be accused of being the perpetrator after Twitter users narrowed down the list of attendees at the party in question. The Alien vs. Predator star quickly shut down the accusations on March 26, tweeting, “Y’all are funny. Under no circumstances did I bite Beyoncé and if I did it would’ve been a love bite.”	1

"What were you doing at the age of four?  Kicking a football around the garden? Cutting the hair off your favourite doll? Scraping your knees while learning to ride a bike?  Well, at the same age, North West has already starred on the cover of Interview magazine alongside her mother Kim Kardashian West in an America's First Family/Kennedy-themed photoshoot, and looks utterly adorable.  Interview Magazine 📸 Steven Klein pic.twitter.com/6Um3JgOm8Q — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) August 28, 2017  While her mother Kim has come under fire from Twitter users calling the photo Jackie Onassis-inspired photoshoot as a 'disgrace' and 'ridiculous', the magazine appearance is the first time North West has publicly given her insight on what it's like to grow up in the Kardashian-West household.  Answering questions from the likes of cousin Penelope Disick, model Kaia Gerber, actress Millie Bobby Brown and Britney Spears' sons Sean and Jayden Federline, North opened up on what's it's like to be...well, North.  Here's what we learned""  1. Her nickname is 'Bubs'  North told Kaia that's what her family calls her.  2. Her Dad wrote her favourite song  Sean and Jayden found out the star thinks her Dad's song 'Amazing' is pretty great.  3. She's a dairy fan  'Just Cheese! Cheese, cheese—everywhere cheese,' she told Gerber about her eating habits.  Getty Images  4. She's a great older sister  Opening up about the best thing about being a sister to Saint, she said she likes 'giving him toy trucks, and I gave him a big toy bear'.  5. She has make-up in her purse  Kanye and Kim's daughter admitted that when she's photographed with a handbag in public, it's usually because she has filled it with 'toys'.  'Sometimes I put some make-up in there when I go to church,' she controversially told artist Andy Warhol.  Seriously, why would a four-year-old have any need for make-up?  6. Her BFF is pretty famous  When asked by Millie Bobby Brown who her best friend is, she replied: 'Mama'.  In the interview, Kim also opened up on what it's like being a mother to North.  'When I'm out and people call North's name, that's when it's weird for me,' she revealed. 'She lives such a normal life, believe it or not, at home.'  On a typical day, without cameras, I wake up early, like six in the morning. I try to work out before the kids get up, and then I have breakfast with them and my husband. I try to make sure we have set meals at home, to keep everything as normal as possible. And then I get to work...In between, I'm taking my son to a music class and my daughter to a horseback riding class.  Discussing what it's like raising a mixed-race daughter, the 36-year-old added:  'Kanye always has his family around and people who look like my daughter—that's important to me,' she explained.  She's obsessed with her curly hair, and if she finds someone who has the same hair, she runs to them and is like, ""You have curly hair like me?"" And we get to talk about it. We also talk about it with my niece Penelope, because she and North look really different, but they're best friends and they're together all the time.  We have a feeling this won't be the last time we hear from North West."	1

Brittany Cartwright went ballistic at Jax Taylor on Monday's episode of Vanderpump Rules as she discovered the extent of his cheating.  The 28-year-old Kentucky native learned that he may have cheated on her multiple times with Faith Stowers.  Brittany was furious at the tanned Lothario and screamed at him: 'You actually f***ed her more than once!'.  Breaking up: Brittany Cartwright ended her relationship with Jax Taylor on Monday's episode of Vanderpump Rules after learning the extent of his cheating  Jax, 38, denied the accusations, but wobbled by asking: 'What does it matter if I did it two or three times?'  His line of reasoning was accurately predicted by Ariana Madix who advised Brittany on how he would likely respond.  'You're disgusting, I f***ing hate you,' Brittany bellowed as Jax made the expected responses.  'This changes everything you piece of s***! …We're done,' she told him.  Strong denial: Jax denied having sex more than once with Faith  Speaker phone: Brittany had their conversation on speaker phone and was shocked at Jax's response  Moving on: The Kentucky native vowed that she was done with Jax  The show opened with Brittany having a 'hungover spa day' with Stassi Schroeder.  The romantic pampering was supposed to be a gift for Jax on their two-year anniversary.  'Since he can't keep it in his pants…I'm taking Stassi,' said Brittany defiantly.  Spa day: Brittany took Stassi Schroeder to a spa outing that was supposed to be a gift for Jax on their two-year anniversary  Stassi advised Brittany to 'never' get back together with the promiscuous barman.  'I'm so confused about everything,' said Brittany, who admitted that she'd had sex with Jax a few times since their split.  'I don't know why,' she cringed.  Breakup sex: Stassi was surprised when Brittany admitted to having sex with Jax  The boys went to a pub to console Jax.  'I wish Brittany would hook up with someone, to make it even,' he admitted.  While Jax boasted about having 'more sex in the last two days than the last six months', Tom Sandoval was peeved about his lack of action with Ariana.  Hooking up: Brittany and Jax were still living together after he admitted cheating on her  'It's been like, f***ing two months,' complained the 34-year-old bartender.  'I literally downloaded an audiobook about intimacy last night,' he sighed.  Tom Schwartz later apologized to Lisa Vanderpump, on Sandoval's behalf.  Intimacy issues: Tom Sandoval complained about not having sex with his girlfriend Ariana Madix  'Showing up with balloons and a puppy dog expression isn't going to change anything,' huffed the British restaurateur.  The ladies threw a party in Brittany's honor, complete with pajamas, a Jax piñata and beer cheese.  'I think they've set aside all their differences for the sake of hating Jax,' said Schwartz.  Teaming up: Tom Schwartz noted how the women were teaming up to hate on Jax  Espionage team: Stassi's skills were listed as Schwartz considered the squad lining up to take on Jax  The women even cast a spell, so Jax could 'receive his karmic punishment,' as Katie Maloney described it.  The men bought Jax a locking chastity penis case to keep him chaste.  'The sex has never been better,' he bragged, shortly before Brittany dumped him, and barred him from their apartment.  Never better: Jax bragged that sex with Brittany 'has never been better' before she called him  Locking case: The guys gifted Jax with a locking penis chastity case  The hostess: Stassi looked stylish in personalized pajamas while hosting the party for Brittany  Making out: Ariana and Stassi kissed as the girls all made up during the party  Lisa back at Sur also met with Lala Kent, who tearfully begged for her job back.  'Clearly you don't need the money,' said Lisa.  Lala admitted she has a man who buys 'amazing things' for her.  She's back: Lala Kent was back and asked Lisa Vanderpump for her old job back  Money matters: The former Sur hostess pulled up in a Range Rover and said sh	1

Following the deadliest mass shooting in American history, in which at least 58 people were killed and 500 wounded at a musical festival in Las Vegas on Sunday night, artists, actors and other celebrities from around the country are now using their platform in the hopes of advancing the conversation about gun control.  Since identified as Stephen Paddock, the shooter opened fire on a crowd from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay hotel, stationed across the street from the outdoor venue where country singer Jason Aldean was performing at the time. The police uncovered at least 10 rifles in Paddock’s room, including hundreds of rounds of ammunition. Eric Paddock, the brother of the suspect, told reporters on Monday that Stephen Paddock legally owned “a couple” of handguns and may have owned one long gun, “but he had them in a safe.” It’s still unclear how Paddock came into possession of so many rifles.  In a ten-tweet-long thread, John Mayer laid out a passionate argument for immediate change with regards to gun control. “I’m going to state my thoughts without the words ‘gun control’ ‘assault rifles’ and others that stoke reflexive debate,” he began. “I’m a logic and reason guy. I like to remove emotion (impossible today) and look at an issue in a theoretical vacuum to make sense of it. Lawmakers and influencers: if you’re not doing everything in your power to at least *reassess* the threat of mass murder, why can’t you come out and tell us that this is the life we’re going to have to accept? That these are the new terms? That it’s a fact of modern day life that from time to time we’ll lose dozens of people in seconds? That daily life is a lottery system? And if you can’t say that, if it’s just too cold and brutal a thought to bear, then isn’t that proof you haven’t solved the problem yet?  He continue: “If you’re not at least trying to fix this, you’re effectively telling the country in your (in)actions that this somehow acceptable. There’s two moralities: morality identity and morality-in-action. Our greater moral identity doesn’t match our actions so far.9) If you’re not open minded to solving this, you’re morally surrendering us all to a very certain fate. There is no in between here. **Please use the energy normally allotted to fighting this argument to rethinking this problem.** Unless you don’t think there is one…”  Billy Eichner was likewise outspoken. After tweeting “enough already” in all caps, the Difficult People and American Horror Story: Cult star questioned why congress hasn’t been pushed more on the matter since Sandy Hook.  GUN CONTROL NOW. ENOUGH ALREADY. GROW THE FUCK UP. THE AVERAGE PERSON DOESN’T NEED A FUCKING MACHINE GUN. ENOUGH ALREADY. ENOUGH. ENOUGH. — billy eichner (@billyeichner) October 2, 2017  AND DON’T TALK ABOUT THE 2ND AMENDMFNT. THEY WEREN’T TALKING ABOUT AUTOMATIC WEAPONS & ANYONE WHO SAYS THAT NONSENSE IS ENABLING MASS MURDER — billy eichner (@billyeichner) October 2, 2017  Congress did nothing after Sandy Hook. NOTHING. Think about how INSANE that is. We’re calling Congress about everything else, why not this?? — billy eichner (@billyeichner) October 2, 2017  Lady Gaga shared a similar message, asking Democrats and Republicans to unite to bring an end to “terrorism.” She then directed a tweet towards Paul Ryan and Donald Trump, urging them to “act quickly” on gun control.  This is terrorism plain and simple. Terror bares no race, gender or religion. Democrats & Republicans please unite now #guncontrol ?? — xoxo, Gaga (@ladygaga) October 2, 2017  Prayers are important but @SpeakerRyan @realDonaldTrump blood is on the hands of those who have power to legislate. #GunControl act quickly. https://t.co/bXZQ7enuEp — xoxo, Gaga (@ladygaga) October 2, 2017  Emmy Rossum, best known for playing the character Fiona Gallagher on Shameless, also tweeted at Trump calling for action.

"Suri Cruise just turned 12 several months ago but a recent report claims that she has already made up her mind about pursuing an acting career. Meanwhile, rumors that her father, Tom Cruise, is fighting to get custody rights and that she allegedly dislikes Katie Holmes’ new relationship have been debunked.  Hollywood Life reported on Wednesday that a “source close to the [family]” claimed that the 12-year-old girl started taking acting classes recently. “She’s caught the acting bug. She’s signed Suri up for one-on-one acting classes with an acting coach and she’s getting private singing and music classes too,” the insider added.  A post shared by Suri Cruise Holmes ???? (@suricruise.official) on Aug 22, 2018 at 9:32am PDT  As a daughter of two very popular actors, it should not be difficult for Suri to find inspirations leading to her dream of becoming an actress as well. But Hollywood Life’s source claimed that the young lady started wanting to become an actress when she visited the set of “The Kennedys: After Camelot.” Holmes played the late Jackie Kennedy in the 2017 miniseries.  The insider stated further that Suri Cruise was fascinated with how the actors prepared for their scenes, especially with their “hair, makeup and wardrobe.” It is not strange for children of popular actors to follow their parents’ legacy. And the report claimed that Katie Holmes is totally on board with Suri’s dream. However, Tom Cruise reportedly thinks his daughter is still quite young to be starting an acting career.  In other news, there has been a recent spike in the number of published rumors that Tom Cruise is fighting to get custody of his 12-year-old daughter. The reports also said that the “Mission Impossible” actor is trying to win back Suri by showering her with gifts aside from his alleged renewed efforts in court.  Recently, it was also reported that Suri Cruise had been “begging” her mom Katie Holmes to ditch her relationship with boyfriend Jamie Foxx. There were recent claims that Suri does not approve of how the singer-actor treats the 39-year-old “Dawson’s Creek” alum.  A post shared by Suri Cruise Holmes ???? (@suricruise.official) on Aug 21, 2018 at 9:16am PDT  Luckily, rumor fact-checking outlet Gossip Cop has debunked these stories. The site calls out tabloids spreading reports about Tom Cruise’s recent efforts to take his daughter from Holmes. Gossip Cop even suggested that the so-called insiders are merely “guessing and speculating"" after dissecting their quoted statements.  Meanwhile, Gossip Cop also debunked the story that Suri Cruise does not like Foxx due to allegations that he continuously flirts with other women — another story that has also been repeatedly refuted.

As had been expected, Meghan Markle made an appearance over the weekend in Toronto at the Invictus Games, the weeklong event which Prince Harry—who, as you may have heard, Markle is dating—created. Markle’s appearance on Saturday in the audience at the opening ceremony may not have been what impatient royal spectators had been hoping for—Markle sat with friend Markus Anderson, situated far from Harry in the arena—but still technically marked their first joint appearance at an official event. (More intriguing: one of Prince Harry’s personal protection officers was standing in the stairwell near Markle, which many are taking as a sign that Markle is in fact already engaged to the royal.)  And it turns out Harry reciprocated, having visited Markle at her place of work earlier in the week. Per several outlets, though originating with a Hello! report, Harry “tried to maintain a low profile” as he stopped by the set of Suits to see Markle in action. “He was super low-key, met some crew, and was so happy to watch his lady,” the source said. “He’s incredibly supportive of her work.” Markle reportedly gave Harry a tour of the set, as well. (We very much want to believe Harry filmed a cameo for an upcoming Suits episode, as well, as a British lawyer on a transfer or the posh cousin of a client, or such.)  Harry will remain in Toronto until Saturday, so it’s very possible we are in for additional sightings and appearances for the couple, though they are also quite well-practiced at this point in doing so without being caught by photographers or otherwise creating any commotion. Though that does not mean they aren’t able to carve out moments of romance when out together: royal reporter Patricia Treble noted that, on Saturday at the opening ceremony, when everyone in the audience had their eyes on the stage for the rendition of “O Canada,” Prince Harry “turned his head and looked at Meghan Markle” from across the section between them in the crowd. Treble noted, “He took advantage of a rare moment out of the spotlight. It lasted a good 10 seconds. She didn’t notice. Yup, he’s in love.”	1

"Will Perry Wright live on?  Alexander Skarsgard’s diabolical, abusive character, Perry Wright, was killed off in the finale of the first season of the hit HBO drama, Big Little Lies. So, fans were confused when they saw photos of Skarsgard on the show’s season two set.  ""I was on set, yes. I can’t disclose what I did on set,” Skarsgard coyly shared on Wednesday’s Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon. ""Maybe, I was acting. I might have been just moral support. I might have just made coffee for the ladies. I might have helped Meryl Streep with her acting… Not help, but just give her little pointers, fine tune it a bit.”  In the upcoming season, Streep is portraying Mary Louise Wright, the headstrong mother of Perry. If Skarsgard does end up reprising his role in the series, even in flashbacks, it will be his first real chance to work with Streep, despite them having both starred in the 2014 film The Giver.  ""I did a movie years ago and one of the incentives was to work with Meryl Streep. It was a scene with Meryl Streep and I was very, very excited about it,” he recalled. ""I didn’t sleep the night before. I was really excited about it. I showed up on set and I was like, ‘Alright, where is Mrs. Streep?’”  Turns out, she was no where near the set in South Africa.  ""And they were like, ‘Oh no, she’s in London. She’s going to be hologram in this scene because it’s a sci-fi. So you’re just going to stare into empty space here and say your lines and someone will read Meryl’s lines off camera,’” Skarsgard recalled, laughing.  Skarsgard won both an Emmy and a Golden Globe for his role as Perry in Big Little Lies, as did his on-screen wife, Nicole Kidman.  Last summer, the 42-year-old actor pitched some ideas to ET as to how his character could return to the show.  ""Well, we can do a prequel,"" he suggested. ""I tried to pitch the idea of Perry having a twin sister who shows up, Terry, and she's, like, pissed off because all these ladies killed her brother. So, basically a revenge story of her just going berserk in Monterey and killing all these women.""

Billy Graham speaks on stage on the third and last day of his farewell American revival in the Queens borough of New York. A spokesman said on Graham has died at his home in North Carolina at age 99. (AP Photo/Henny Ray Abrams)  MONTREAT, N.C. (AP) — The Rev. Billy Graham, the magnetic, movie-star-handsome preacher who became a singular force in postwar American religious life, a confidant of presidents and the most widely heard Christian evangelist in history, died Wednesday at 99.  “America’s Pastor,” as he was dubbed, had suffered from cancer, pneumonia and other ailments and died at his home in North Carolina. Graham died at 7:46 a.m., with only an attending nurse inside the home, said Mark DeMoss, spokesman for the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association. Both the nurse and Graham’s longtime personal physician, Dr. Lucian Rice, who arrived about 20 minutes later, said it was “a peaceful passing,” DeMoss said.  More than anyone else, Graham built evangelicalism into a force that rivaled liberal Protestantism and Roman Catholicism in the U.S. His leadership summits and crusades in more than 185 countries and territories forged powerful global links among conservative Christians and threw a lifeline to believers in the communist bloc.  Tributes to Graham poured in from major leaders, with President Donald Trump tweeting: “The GREAT Billy Graham is dead. There was nobody like him! He will be missed by Christians and all religions. A very special man.” Former President Barack Obama said Graham “gave hope and guidance to generations of Americans.”  A tall, striking man with thick, swept-back hair, stark blue eyes and a firm jaw, Graham was a commanding presence in the pulpit, with a powerful baritone voice.  “The Bible says,” was his catchphrase. His unquestioning belief in Scripture turned the Gospel into a “rapier” in his hands, he said.  Graham reached multitudes around the globe through public appearances and his pioneering use of prime-time telecasts, network radio, daily newspaper columns, evangelistic films and satellite TV hookups.  By his final crusade in 2005 in New York City, he had preached in person to more than 210 million people worldwide. No evangelist is expected to have his level of influence again.  “William Franklin Graham Jr. can safely be regarded as the best who ever lived at what he did,” said William Martin, author of the Graham biography “A Prophet With Honor.”  Graham’s body was moved Wednesday from his home in Montreat to Asheville, where a funeral home is handling the arrangements, DeMoss said. Graham’s body will be taken from Asheville to Charlotte on Saturday in a procession expected to take 3 ½ hours and ending at the Billy Graham Museum and Library. He will lie in repose Monday and Tuesday in the Charlotte house where he grew up, which was moved from its original location to the grounds of the Graham library. A private funeral for Graham will be held on Friday, March 2, in a tent at the library site and he will be buried next to his wife there, DeMoss said. Invitations to the funeral will be extended to President Donald Trump and former presidents, he said.  DeMoss said Graham spent his final months in and out of consciousness. He said Graham didn’t take any phone calls or entertain guests. DeMoss quoted Dr. Rice as saying, “He just wore out.”  Graham was a counselor to U.S. presidents of both parties from Dwight Eisenhower to George W. Bush. In 1983, President Ronald Reagan gave him the Presidential Medal of Freedom, America’s highest civilian honor. When the Billy Graham Museum and Library was dedicated in 2007 in Charlotte, North Carolina, George H.W. Bush, Jimmy Carter a	1

Gwyneth Paltrow has faced her share of critics since launching her lifestyle brand Goop in 2008. With almost 10 years of Web site experience under her belt (and decades more as a Hollywood actress), Paltrow typically seems unbothered by her opponents, who have lambasted her for everything from publishing outrageous gift guides to using pseudo-science to promote products. That is until ob-gyn Jen Gunter, a longtime critic of the lifestyle Web site, published a blog post in January about Goop selling its much-discussed $66 vaginal jade eggs, writing, “The only thing your post got right is to check with your doctor before using one. So let me give you some free advice, don’t use vaginal jade eggs.” In a rare move, Goop responded, on Thursday, with Paltrow tweeting out a link to the statement, along with Michelle Obama’s famed Democratic convention quote, “When they go low, we go high,” which, it should be noted, was not in reference to vaginas.  “As goop has grown, so has the attention we receive. We consistently find ourselves to be of interest to many—and for that, we are grateful—but we also find that there are third parties who critique goop to leverage that interest and bring attention to themselves,” the post began before turning its focus to Gunter, who was referred to as a “San Francisco-based ob-gyn/blogger,” who, Goop claimed, “has been taking advantage of the attention and issuing attacks to build her personal platform—ridiculing the women who might read our site in the process.”  Goop’s blog ended with letters from two doctors, Steven Gundry and Aviva Romm. Gundry opened his letter criticizing Gunter’s language (“I have never seen a medical discussion start or end with the ‘F-bomb,’ yet yours did”) before proceeding to list off his résumé, making sure to add that he has never “dropped” an “F-bomb” while speaking with a “discussant.”  Gunter spoke to Buzzfeed about Goop’s statement while on vacation in England, telling the outlet she “was shocked to see Gundry mansplaining science to me. I have four board certifications. I was a doctor when I was 23.” She also questioned why she was the one to be singled out by Goop and Paltrow, as there are many Goop-critics to choose from, including Stephen Colbert and Timothy Caulfield, who wrote an article for Salon in 2015 called “Gwyneth Paltrow Is Wrong About Everything” and recently published a book with a slightly less-declarative title, “Is Gwyneth Paltrow Wrong About Everything?: When Celebrity Culture and Science Clash.” Caulfield also spoke to Buzzfeed about Gunter’s work, saying, “We need more and more voices like Jen to combat the noise on pop culture around health, which is often dominated by science-free celebrities.”  It’s difficult to pinpoint exactly why Jen Gunter was the one to face the unusual ire of Goop and the Goop-adjacent. It could be because, unlike Colbert or even Caulfield, Gunter, as an unknown target, was easier to lash out at. Or maybe she was Goop's most-prolific critic who finally managed to push one button too many. Or Goop was just really tired of all those F-bombs. Whatever the reason and regardless of scientific facts, history has taught us that the world of Goop will keep on spinning.	0

"She's the cute, curly-haired, bubbly blonde second stewardess that had all the boys swooning aboard the Valor superyacht in the fourth season of Bravo's hit reality show Below Deck.  And now Emily Warburton-Adams is dishing on what really went on behind the scenes of the luxury boat where she catered to the rich and famous.  In an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com, the 24-year-old London-born star tells how she rubbed elbows with celebrities, experienced 'cabin-hopping' and was even propositioned by some inappropriate guests.  'Some guests were absolutely lovely and nice, but some treat you very inhumanely, and I didn't appreciate that,' she says.  She explains how one drunk guest even went as far to tell her he wanted to 'see her ""V.""'  Emily Warburton-Adams reveals what it was really like to work aboard superyacht Valor sharing tiny quarters and bunk beds with her castmates and crew  The 24-year-old appeared on the fourth season of Bravo's Below Deck, working as 2nd Stewardess. Pictured: (l-r) Trevor Walker, Kate Chastain, Sierra Storm, Ben Robinson, Captain Lee Rosbach, Nico Sholly, Kelley Johnson, Lauren Burchell and Emily  But Emily learned to take it all in stride.  'A lot happens, especially after three in the morning, I learned to sort of sweep it under the carpet. Guests are drunk and obnoxious and they can go too far,' she says.  Emily caught the travel bug early in life having visited India alone at 18 and other places as a child, and 'loved it.'  Although she received top grades at boarding school, she passed on the opportunity to go to university and 'chose the ""school of life"" route' instead.  She was introduced to the yachting industry by a close friend, named Harriet.  'There's a lot of upfront expenses in qualifications and training before you can even work on one of these yachts, I'm not sure people realize that.'  Her initial investment was approximately $3,800.  'It included personal survival, fire fighting, medical, security, and survival craft (raft) training, we had to fight and extinguish actual fires, pull out heavy fake bodies stuffed with sand out of emergency situations, it was exhausting.  'I took food hygiene level two, as well as silver service and training in wine and spirits. You also have to be able to pass a medical assessment test.'  But the hard work is all worth it for the big pay day and lavish lifestyle.  The London-born reality star, pictured in a bathroom of a cabin, says she was introduced to the yachting industry by a close friend and spent four years catering to the rich and famous  Emily says 17-hour work days are the norm at sea, and at times, the crew is too busy to even leave the yacht to see the islands  Captains Lee Rosbach and Sandy Yawn have been seen on the show huddling in the crew mess after their wealthy guests have left to divvy up the deck and interior staff tips.  The yacht crew collects a regular base salary, but the cash tips are tax free and the real reward for all that hard work, Emily reveals, can be in the tens of thousands of dollars for one week, if you're extremely lucky.  Bravo pays its recurring yacht workers like Chief Stewardess Kate Chastain and Chef Ben Robinson more than those who are only there for one season.  And while she won't disclose her salary, Emily says, 'I can tell you this, I did not make enough.'  But for whatever the money comes a lot of hard work, where 17-hour days can be the norm.  There are times, Emily says, a yacht may pull up to an exotic port in the likes of Corsica, and the crew is too busy working to even go outside and see it.  'Honestly, sometimes you're so tired that when the guests are off the boat and you get a two-hour break you just need to sleep.'  A yacht like the 154 ft Valor, which sleeps twelve guests, costs almost $200,000 a week to charter, and the price just goes on up with larger vessels.

Mexican baseball player  Loaiza and the second or maternal family name is Veyna. This article uses Spanish naming customs : the first or paternal family name isand the second or maternal family name is  Esteban Antonio Loaiza Veyna [lo-EYE-sa] (born December 31, 1971) is a Mexican retired professional baseball pitcher. He played in Major League Baseball for the Pittsburgh Pirates, Texas Rangers, Toronto Blue Jays, Chicago White Sox, New York Yankees, Washington Nationals, Oakland Athletics, and Los Angeles Dodgers. Loaiza was the American League's (AL) starting pitcher in the 2003 All-Star Game. That year, he led the AL in strikeouts.  In August 2018, Loaiza pleaded guilty to federal drug charges in California; he was sentenced to three years in jail.[1]  Early career [ edit ]  A graduate of Mar Vista High School in Imperial Beach, California, Loaiza was signed by the Pittsburgh Pirates as an undrafted free agent on March 21, 1991. With the Gulf Coast Pirates in the Rookie leagues he started five games in 1991, finishing with a 5–1 record and a 2.26 earned run average (ERA). He moved through the Pirates farm system with stops at Augusta (class A – 1992), Salem (class A – 1993) and Carolina (class AA – 1993-1994). He also played for the Mexico City Red Devils of the Mexican Summer League during the 1993 season. He has played with the Mexicali Aguilas of the Liga Mexicana Del Pacifico.  Major Leagues [ edit ]  Pittsburgh Pirates [ edit ]  Loaiza moved to a big league club in 1995, making his major league debut on April 29, 1995, for the Pirates against the Philadelphia Phillies. He worked 4​2⁄ 3 innings in the game, giving up five hits and one unearned run to achieve the first major league win of his career. He finished his rookie season with an 8–9 record and a 5.16 ERA in 31 starts.  He began the 1996 season back in the minors with the Triple-A Calgary Cannons, but was recalled to the majors on June 7.[2]  The Pirates traded Loaiza to the Texas Rangers on July 17, 1998, in exchange for Todd Van Poppel and Warren Morris.[3]  Texas Rangers [ edit ]  He spent the next two seasons with Texas, pitching both as a starter and a reliever for the Rangers.[4][5]  Toronto Blue Jays [ edit ]  The Rangers traded Loaiza to the Toronto Blue Jays on July 19, 2000 for Michael Young and Darwin Cubillán.[6] He pitched with the Blue Jays through 2002.  Chicago White Sox (2003–2004) [ edit ]  After signing with the Chicago White Sox as a free agent, Loaiza enjoyed a career season in 2003, leading American League pitchers in strikeouts (207), and was second in wins (21) and strikeouts per nine innings (8.23); third in ERA (2.90), and sixth in innings pitched (226.3). Considered for the Cy Young Award, Loaiza finished second behind Roy Halladay, ahead of Pedro Martínez and Tim Hudson. He was an All-Star selection both in 2003 and 2004. Loaiza's 21 wins in 2003 are tied for the most ever in a season for a Mexican pitcher; Fernando Valenzuela won 21 games in 1986.  Chicago White Sox, New York Yankees [ edit ]  In 2004, Loaiza was elected to the All-Star game as a member of the White Sox. Soon after his appearance in the All-Star game, he was traded to the New York Yankees mid-season for José Contreras.[7][8] He did not perform well in New York and was moved to the bullpen during the regular season. During the ALCS against the Boston Red Sox, he pitched well in two relief outings despite recording the loss in Game 5.[9]  Washington Nationals [ edit ]  Following the 2004 season, he signed a one-year deal with the Washington Nationals as a free agent.

Is morning television on the brink of a major change? NBC chairman Andy Lack just signed Megyn Kelly to a major deal, and now the New York Post reports that there are rumors at the Peacock Network that the former Fox News star could take over for Savannah Guthrie on the Today show.  Though Kelly had taken pitches from ABC and CNN after leaving FOX, the promise of a daytime slot and a Sunday night show at NBC was too much for her to pass up. However, there may not be much to the Today rumors — NBC insists that Guthrie, who is currently on maternity leave and recently signed a five-year deal with Today, isn’t going anywhere.  “We just signed Savannah to a massive deal that is longer than Megyn’s,” a high-level NBC source told Page Six. “A lead anchor role at Today isn’t part of the conversation for Megyn. The goal was simply to get someone of Megyn’s talent and caliber through the door at NBC. We have not made a decision on her daytime slot. It is being discussed.”  It was rumored that Kelly was in deep talks with ABC to replace Robin Roberts on Good Morning America, though network officials have denied any such reports.  Kelly, who was FOX’s No. 2 anchor for some time behind Bill O’Reilly, announced earlier this month that she would be leaving the network for NBC News. Her decision comes after Greta Van Susteren also departed FOX last fall in favor of MSNBC, leaving the network without its top two female anchors. Mediaite claimed that FOX had offered Kelly as much as $100 million to remain, though it seems money did not sway her final decision. She will be replaced by The Daily Caller founder Tucker Carlson.  Also on FORBES:  “I have grown up here and been given every chance a young reporter could ever ask for,” she said while praising Rupert Murdoch and the FOX family.  Kelly spent 12 years with FOX, quickly climbing up the ranks and becoming a nationally recognized brand. President-elect Trump’s attacks on her during the election cycle helped raise her profile even more. However, a possible Today gig is a far different animal than the 9 p.m. slot Kelly is used to, with audiences typically favoring entertainment stories and lighter subject matter as opposed to her traditional hard news.  Will Carlson, who has had an up-and-down career in front of the cameras, be an effective replacement at FOX? Will NBC push Guthrie out on Today in favor of Kelly? The answers to both questions will have far reaching impacts for their respective networks.  Save  Save  Save  Save  Save  Save  If you like what you're reading, follow @Great_Katzby on Twitter.	0

"He's back!  ""It's so good to see famous people again,"" David Letterman declared as he took the stage as a guest on Tuesday's Jimmy Kimmel Live.  The 70-year-old comedian's appearance on JKL -- which is filming all week in Brooklyn, New York -- marked the first time he's been on late-night TV since he retired over two years ago as the host of CBS' The Late Show.  ""It feels so good to be out of the house, ladies and gentlemen!"" Letterman joked before calling out Paul Shaffer, the former band leader of The Late Show, for also making an appearance on Kimmel's program. ""Paul, you work here now?""  MORE: David Letterman Returning to TV With New Netflix Series  Letterman sarcastically revealed what he misses most about being on TV every night. ""I miss wearing makeup,"" he mused, later adding, ""I'm profiling through, 'Was I fired or did I retire?'""  Kimmel -- who wore a tie that Letterman gifted him when he left The Late Show -- insisted, ""You retired! There was a whole thing.""  Letterman then took a walk down memory lane and recalled the time he gifted Conan O'Brien with a horse, which didn't go over too well.  The intention behind the present was that O'Brien would bring the horse out on his show and it would ""take a dump"" on the stage, an idea that Letterman found ""hilarious.""  However, the former host said a few days later, he learned something went ""terribly wrong.""  ""I get this warm, lovely letter that says, 'My wife loves the horse, and she's going to keep the horse because she an equestrian'"" Letterman reminisced. ""Now I'm screwed because I was counting on him returning the horse and I get my money back.""  WATCH: David Letterman Talks Late-Night Television Today, Shades Jimmy Fallon -- 'I Would've Went to Work on Trump'  Further defending the gift, he exclaimed, ""It was joke! Take a dump on the stage, load him up, get him back!""  O'Brien has apparently changed his mind about the horse since his ""warm letter.""  ""From what people are talking about, Conan will just not shut up about the horse. The horse has gone crazy, maybe its from being around Conan all day,"" Letterman quipped. ""Of course he's unridable, all he had to do was take a dump on the stage.""  For 33 years, Letterman fans got to watch jokes such as these when he was a late-night television host, first getting his start on NBC's Late Night before going on to host The Late Show.  On May 20, 2015, over 13 million people watched Letterman host his final episode of The Late Show.

"Meghan Markle and Prince Harry are getting married one month from today.  Sorry, let us try that again, this time with the proper level of enthusiasm one should muster for such an announcement:  MEGHAN MARKLE AND PRINCE HARRY ARE GETTING MARRIED ONE MONTH FROM TODAY! EEEEEEK!!!!  That's better, don't you think?  But even though one month is a very small period of time until the Royal Wedding bells ring, those close to Markle reportedly think it's not small enough.  They wish the wedding were taking place tomorrow.  Because then they'd only have 24 hour left to deal what one source is describing as the ultimate Bridezilla.  Yes, this source is looking at you, Meghan Markle.  “Meghan’s driving everyone crazy with her diva demands,” an insider tells Life & Style, adding of the bride-to-be:  “She’s a perfectionist, and she’s trying to control everything going on around her.”  This is the first time we've heard of Markle being described as basically anything other than kind, generous, loyal, lovely and loving.  Aside from those racist trolls who gave Meghan and Harry problems early on in their romance due to the former's mixed heritage, Markle has received nothing but positive reviews for over a year now.  Everyone seems to adore her!  But weddings do have a way of causing such stress and tension for those prominently involved that it's nearly impossible not to snap on occasion.  And those are just regular weddings; with, like 75 to 100 guests.  Markle and Harry will be getting married in front of thousands of people lining the London streets, as well as millions more watching from home.  According to this tabloid source, the former Suits actress feels a lot of pressure to follow “the rules of royal etiquette” on her big day, but is also “worried about her family being on their best behavior.”  This last part is a bit unusual, however, because we're under the impression that almost no one from Markle's family is invited.  Just last week, Markle's controversial half-sister spoke out and complained about her lack of a wedding invite.  ""Humanitarians move forward with love and kindness especially to Family,"" Samanha Grant Tweeted about her snub, attempting to shame Markle into extending the invite.  So far, though, it has failed to work.  It is expected that Markle's parents will be in attendance, with her mom actually walking her down the aisle instead of her dad.  This is because Thomas Markle is famously shy.  He and Meghan's mother split a long time ago and Thomas now lives a very quiet life in Mexico. Sources have told The Sun that he's afraid to face the ""world’s glare"" on May 19.  But face it he will, at least in some capacity.  Just like those complaining about Markle's recent behavior, we're guessing Thomas will be happy when the wedding day comes and then goes.  What about YOU?  Are you sick of all this Royal coverage?  Or do you wish there was even more of it?"	0

"(CNN) O.J. Simpson is beginning post-prison life in the city where he committed the crime that saw him locked up.  After serving nine years for a Las Vegas kidnapping and armed robbery he left prison early Sunday to start a new chapter as a parolee.  Simpson's parole plan was agreed upon at Lovelock Correctional Center prior to his release, Nevada's Division of Parole and Probation said.  ""Mr. Simpson submitted a parole release plan for a residence in Las Vegas, Nevada. The plan was investigated and approved by the Division of Parole and Probation,"" it said.  The center did not provide more specifics of Simpson's release plan, saying it was up to Simpson, his family and his attorney as to whether they wanted such information shared.  However, now that the former NFL star is out of prison, those who know him are not expecting him to become a recluse.  ""He's not going to hide,"" said longtime friend Tom Scotto, who attended Simpson's parole hearing this summer.  Several associates told CNN Simpson would be living in a gated residence with unspecified friends in a wealthy Las Vegas suburb, and planned to move to Florida later on.  ""He's going to focus on kids, friends, his family and golf,"" Scotto said. ""Maybe not the first day or second, but he is going to go out.""  Two of Simpson's children live in the Tampa Bay area in Florida, one lives in Los Angeles and another in Georgia.  'Don't come back'  Simpson was picked up by a friend shortly after midnight local time Sunday, according to Brooke Keast, a spokeswoman for the Nevada Department of Corrections.  ""I told him, 'Don't come back,' and he responded, 'I don't intend to,'"" she said. ""He was upbeat, personable and seemed happy to get on with his life.""  Unlike previous instances, where controversy followed wherever he went, Simpson was released in the middle of the night to avoid media attention.  ""Our biggest concern was our safety and the public's safety and not wanting anybody, paparazzi, to follow him,"" Keast said. ""He left through a big blue door through the front gatehouse and exited quietly. He looked down because he didn't want to be photographed.""  Meeting with parole officer  Before his release, prison officials did an inventory of what he wanted to take with him or leave behind. He walked out of prison with paperwork and ""three or four boxes about the size of a microwave,"" according to Keast.  Inside the boxes were items such as a hot plate, clothing and shower shoes, she said.  Simpson also met with one person who'll become a fixture in his post-prison life: his parole officer.  ""They went over what he needs for parole and where he needs to check in, what he should do to get a driver's license, et cetera, (and) instructions on what to do once he's out there,"" Keast said.  The Nevada Board of Parole Commissioners voted unanimously in July to release Simpson after he served nine years of a 33-year sentence for armed robbery and kidnapping.  During that robbery in 2007, he was part of a group that raided a hotel and casino to steal sports memorabilia at gunpoint. Simpson, a former player for the Buffalo Bills, said the items belonged to him.  No drugs, no alcohol  As a parolee, Simpson will have to meet a number of conditions set by the Nevada parole board.  While out of prison, he won't have the liberty to consume alcohol in large quantities or hang out with ex-convicts. The Nevada parole board forbids parolees from associating with convicted felons and people who engage in criminal activity, or possessing guns and drugs. Alcohol abuse can get a parolee hauled back to prison.  ""You are permitt ed to consume alcoholic beverages but not in excess,"" the conditions of parole supervision read. ""You shall submit to a medically recognized test for blood/breath content. Test results of .08 alcohol or higher shall be sufficient proof of excess.""  Simpson received a bad score on his parole risk assessment guideline in the drug/alcohol abuse category, with the document citing him"	1
"Kendall Jenner Strips Down for La Perla's Latest Pop Art-Inspired Lingerie Campaign  Kendall Jenner is taking it all off—actually just most of it -- for La Perla's eye-popping Pre-Fall 2017 Campaign. The colorful campaign features a kaleidoscopic world designed by La Perla Creative Director, Julia Haart, and was inspired by the art of Georgia O’Keeffe and Peter Max.  The supermodel showed off her phenomenal form in the psychedelic shoot, which fuses pop art, modernism and fashion.  According to the brand's press release, Kendall has been cast as a Dorothy-esque protagonist entering into the colorful Land of Oz: ""Jenner exudes the certainty and self-assurance of a true heroine—owning her world through confidence and empowered femininity.""  Photographed by Mert & Marcus, ""The explosive visual message is intended to shock and transport the viewer to a world of fantasy, color, and art.""  In one rather revealing image, Kenny, rocking a red lip, shows off her lean limbs in La Perla's triangle bra and shorts with floral-inspired Leavers lace embroidered in contrasting color and finished with velvet trim. The scintillating look is finished with a sky-high floral platform wedge.  The 21-year-old is also featured in the La Perla Slip Dress which boasts a built-in padded bra and sculpted bodice sewn from stretch silk with Leavers lace detailing that echo the floral pattern. The colorful look is accessorized with a cross-body micro Ada Bag made with pony hair.  Haart previously told E! News that she believes beauty is about feeling confident in who you are."	1
As if pumpkin spice lattes and pumpkin-scented candles weren’t enough, Catherine Zeta-Jones is giving us yet another reason to obsess over the seasonal vegetable this fall—and maybe even year-round. In an interview with W magazine, the 48-year-old actress revealed that her secret to smooth, glowing skin isn’t a beauty product gifted from the gods, but a serum made primarily of pumpkin.  Speaking to W, Zeta-Jones called Rhonda Allison’s Pumpkin E Serum one of her “makeup miracles.” She also has the facts to back it up. The fall favorite boasts several health benefits, including powerful antioxidants, nutrients, and enzymes that increase cell turnover and smooth and brighten skin.  Along with moisturizing with pumpkin, Zeta-Jones also follows an alcohol-free diet to keep her skin clean and taut. “Water, maintaining my PH balance, no alcohol and through diet keeping my body free of any inflammation inside and out, she said.  And though she’s big on beauty (her favorite products include MAC’s Spice Lip Liner, Marc Jacobs’s Slow Burn Lipstick, and Clé de Peau Intensive Eye Contour Cream), Zeta-Jones admits that “nothing can be done properly in five minutes,” which is probably why she likes to keep her skin extra healthy.  Unlike pumpkin spice lattes, the best thing about Zeta-Jones’s pumpkin serum is that you can whip it out year-round without fear of looking #basic. Check out more pumpkin-based beauty products in our slideshow, below.	1
"Katherine Heigl joins 'Suits' in the wake of Meghan Markle's departure  USA has tapped Katherine Heigl to replace Meghan Markle on its long-running legal dramedy Suits.  The Grey's Anatomy star will play Samantha Wheeler, a disruptive new partner at the law firm when production begins on Season 8 this April in Toronto.  “I have watched Suits from the very beginning and feel incredibly lucky to be the newest member of the Pearson Specter Litt family,” Heigl, 39, said in a statement.  In his own statement, Suits creator Aaron Korsh proclaimed, “I cannot wait to have her come play with our entire cast and crew. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for Harvey, Louis, Donna and Alex as the mysterious Samantha Wheeler is a direct threat to their status quo.""  The Emmy-winning Heigl, who left Grey's Anatomy in 2010 to concentrate on her then-hot film career, has since starred in a pair of short-lived TV dramas, NBC's State of Affairs and, more recently, CBS' Doubt.  On Tuesday, USA announced that Markle's final episode will be April 25 and that Dulé Hill, a veteran of The West Wing and Pysch, would replace the departing Patrick J. Adams."	1
"The final days of a pregnancy can often be riddled with anxiety and impatience for baby's impending arrival, but it seems Ciara and Russell Wilson were filled with nothing but peace.  The singer shared a beautiful black-and-white video to her Instagram account on Sunday, documenting how the couple spent their last moments together before their daughter, Sienna Princess Wilson, was born on Friday, April 28. The clip shows the duo—who married in a romantic ceremony in the English countryside last July—enjoying some sweet together time by the beach, being playful on the swings, and walking hand-in-hand along the ocean. ""You bring us peace,"" Ciara wrote alongside the video.  The documentary-style clip also shows Wilson taking photographs of his pregnant wife on the sandy shores, one of which Ciara used soon thereafter to announce the birth of their daughter. The shot features Ciara in all white, kneeling and cradling her stomach, and looking out at the ocean waves. ""Dear Sienna Princess Wilson,"" the caption on the photo reads. ""No matter how big the wave, we will always be your calm in the storm. We Love You."" In addition to that sweet message, Ciara also shared Sienna's birth date and time (April 28 at 7:03 P.M.) and weight (7 pounds 13 ounces) with the stunning photograph.  Sienna is Ciara and Wilson's first child together. (Ciara has a son, Future Zahir, with her former fiancé, rapper Future.) The birth of Sienna caps off a whirlwind two years for the couple, who began dating in April 2015, were engaged in March 2016, got married in July, and then announced they were pregnant in October with a beautiful Instagram shot of Wilson embracing Ciara's growing belly. Sending lots of well wishes their way!  Related:"	1

"For comedians, anything can be a punchline. And in 2005's ""The 40-Year-Old-Virgin,"" Steve Carell shouting out Kelly Clarkson's name while in pain certainly brought the laughs.  Steve Carell in ""The 40-Year-Old-Virgin"" yelling ""Kelly Clarkson!"" and, of course, Kelly Clarkson.  But when the pair finally met up at this year's Golden Globes, it looked like Carell might have some explaining to do. Was she just a joke?  Trending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service  That was Carell's concern, as he told ""The Tonight Show's"" Jimmy Fallon Thursday while visiting to talk about his new film, ""Welcome to Marwen.""  ""My wife and I saw her (at the Globes) and my wife said, 'There she is!' And we had to go over and we kind of accosted her and said, 'Hi, we've never met but I really wanted to introduce myself,"" he recalled. ""She could not have been nicer.""  He also admitted to being a big fan of her music.  ""I thought she’d be mad about me about (the scene),"" he said. ""Because I'd never met her over those years. Like, 'Is he making fun of me?' Like, 'Why would he say that in anguish?'""  In case you haven't seen the movie, in the scene in question Carell's character is having his very hairy chest waxed, patch by patch.

But, she added, ""I have yet to meet Steve Carell and I want to be like, 'So was it a compliment?' I don't know — if you’re in pain and you think of Kelly Clarkson ...""

Chris Pratt is finally taking a bite out of the headlines surrounding his split from Anna Faris.  The 38-year-old covers Entertainment Weekly’s Summer Movie Preview for his upcoming blockbuster “Jurassic World: Fallen Kingdom,” and he got candid about his breakup.  “Divorce sucks,” Chris told EW. “But at the end of the day, we’ve got a great kid who’s got two parents who love him very much. And we’re finding a way to navigate this while still remaining friends and still being kind to one another. It’s not ideal, but yeah, I think both of us are actually probably doing better.”  Anna Faris Talks Co-Parenting Son Jack With Her Ex, Chris Pratt  Anna echoed a similar sentiment about life after divorce in April’s Women’s Health cover story.  “What Chris and I try to do is to communicate openly. We reiterate that there aren’t rules to this. We have a lot of love and friendship, and our big goal is to protect Jack,” she said.  Anna Faris Says She’s Unsure If She’ll Remarry After Her Split From Chris Pratt  The couple first met on the 2007 film, “Take Me Home Tonight,” and went on to tie the knot on July 9, 2009. They welcomed 5-year-old son Jack in August 2012. Both Anna and Chris announced their separation on Aug. 7, 2017 after 8 years of marriage.  News of their split shocked fans and sparked social media speculation, but both stars maintain that there is nothing but love between them.  “It’s understandable that people seemed so invested in our happiness together,” Anna previously told People. “All I can say about that is, it’s all true, that we truly adore each other, and we love each other, I think it still comes through.”	0

Tituss Burgess delivered one of ET's Standout Performances of the 2017-18 season.    For four seasons (and a possible movie), Tituss Burgess has embodied Titus Andromedon, the unapologetically loud and proud roommate to Kimmy Schmidt (Ellie Kemper) on Netflix’s Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt. He’s flamboyant. He’s verbose. He’s nothing short of snarky. He’s a struggling actor -- rather, an “undercover superstar” -- who has a tendency to get in the way of his own success. He emotes through Beyonce, hiding nothing from his friend Kimmy, landlord Lillian (Carol Kane), agent Jacqueline White (Jane Krakowski) or ex-lover Mikey (Mike Carlsen).  “Playing him is exhausting,” Burgess tells ET by phone. It’s the day of the Royal Wedding, but the actor is as far removed from the day’s festivities -- he’s traveling to Washington, D.C., where he’s set to perform at the 2018 WNO Opera Gala Concert the next day -- as he is from his onscreen persona. “I don't live in that space. My energy hovers around a two or three on a scale of one to 10.” That’s not to say the actor hasn’t enjoyed playing the character -- in fact, it’s been a career-making moment -- but when it’s 5 a.m. on set and he has to deliver all of Titus’ eccentricities, “it takes a toll.”  Burgess recalls being on set the day before with Kemper as the two filmed scenes from the show’s final episodes when it dawned on both of them that this journey was coming to an end. “She and I looked at each other and realized how blessed we were and what an unusual experience we got to have and what an unusual show we got to do,” he says of the series that has been anything but typical.  Telling the story of a young woman who moves to New York City after being forced to live in an underground bunker for the past 15 years, the incredibly quirky series co-created by Tina Fey and Robert Carlock was slated for a 13-episode run on NBC before unexpectedly being sold to Netflix, which picked it up for an initial two seasons. Kimmy Schmidt became the streaming network’s first original half-hour comedy and was met with critical acclaim, as well as 16 Primetime Emmy nominations in its first three seasons. Now, the show is drawing to a close with a final fourth season that's broken up into two parts -- the second half of season four premieres Jan. 25, 2019 -- and a reported movie. (While Burgess confirms that a movie has been proposed, Netflix has yet to make an official announcement or respond to requests for comment about it.)  “I think Kimmy began to sync up with Ellie and both of them began to have the same experience of gratitude, zooming out and being able to see the larger picture. I think the same happened with Titus and myself,” Burgess recalls. (The plot of the final episodes, he teases, mirrors both the real-life and onscreen journeys for Kemper and Burgess.)  The gratitude also extends not only to the Emmys, which has nominated Burgess for three consecutive Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series awards, but to the streaming platform, which has introduced the actor (and character) to an international audience. “Nothing will match this experience because it put me on the map,” he says.  Tituss Burgess in a scene from 'Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.' Netflix  As to why Titus has continuously resonated with voters and viewers alike, he says it’s because of how unique the character is. “I didn’t have that type of representation when I was growing up,” Burgess says. “By the sheer fact that he was new made for something to latch onto. It represented how the landscape in television was and is changing.” There’s also a vicarious experience audiences get by watching someone who is as unfiltered as Titus is, the actor muses, adding that if the show debuted today, he might not have had the same impact. “Titus wouldn’t pop as much under this current administration. People would see it as one of the many unfiltered, loud voices we hear today. Four years ago, believe it or not, was a far more civilized time	1
LONDON — The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (Bafta) said Wednesday it has suspended Harvey Weinstein’s membership, effective immediately.  The organization acted as the scandal engulfing the Hollywood producer continued to widen, with new claims he raped an Italian film star and two other women drawing condemnation from across the film world and America’s liberal political elite.  In a statement Bafta said it hoped the decision “sends a clear message that such behavior has absolutely no place in our industry.”  Get The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Free Sign Up  “Whilst Bafta has previously been a beneficiary of Mr. Weinstein’s support for its charitable work, it considers the reported alleged behavior completely unacceptable and incompatible with Bafta’s values,” it added.  The latest allegations against the 65-year-old movie mogul made in a bombshell expose published by The New Yorker on Tuesday escalated the scandal to new levels.  Previous accusations, which led to his weekend sacking from The Weinstein Company, had been limited to complaints about sexual harassment.  High profile actresses Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Heather Graham are among those to have come forward with similar complaints since then.  Weinstein has denied all charges, according to a statement from his spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister, circulated among US media.  Former US President Barack Obama and his wife Michelle, as well as Hillary Clinton, on Tuesday expressed their disgust at the revelations concerning Weinstein, a longtime Democratic Party donor.  Meanwhile the producer’s wife, British fashion designer Georgina Chapman, with whom he has two children, told celebrity magazine People she was planning to leave their marriage.	1
Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding has been one for the history books—in part because of how the couple chose to do things their own way.  Here are all the ways their celebration broke from royal tradition:  Meghan is divorced.  Getty Images  There was a time when a senior royal having a relationship with a divorcee was seen as disastrous. Just 17 years after Edward VIII abdicated in order to marry the twice-divorced Wallis Simpson, Princess Margaret was forced to give up her love affair with Group Captain Peter Townsend.  And over half a century later, Prince Charles was able to finally marry his divorced long-term partner Camilla Parker-Bowles because of new ruling from the Church of England, but there was still public conflict surrounding the couple’s union.  But no more! Meghan has been welcomed into the Royal Family with open arms, and the British public approves of its new princess.  There wasn't a kiss on the Buckingham Palace balcony.  Ever since the weddings of Queen Victoria’s children, it has been customary for royal couples to take to the balcony at Buckingham Palace to acknowledge the crowds below.  Then in 1981, Charles and Diana were the first royal couple to share a kiss in front of the cheering crowds, later followed by Andrew and Sarah, and William and Kate. Because Harry and Meghan aren’t getting married in London, there was no balcony appearance–but that didn't stop them from sharing a kiss for the cameras in Windsor.  Getty Images  The bride and groom spent the night before their wedding in separate hotels.  Cliveden House Courtesy Cliveden House  Royal couples usually spend the night before their wedding at royal residences.Prince Charles and Prince Andrew both stayed at Buckingham Palace the night before their weddings, and their brides nearby at royal residence Clarence House. Although Kate stayed with her family at The Goring Hotel, William was at Clarence House the night before his big day, along with his brother Harry.  However it’s all different this time around. While there are several residences on the Windsor estate that could have served as a last-night base for Harry and Meghan, they chose to stay at Coworth Park and Cliveden House luxury hotels respectively.  The cake flavor came out of left field.  Royal weddings cakes are usually multi-tiered and highly traditional rich fruit cakes encased in marzipan and a thick crust of white icing, however Harry and Meghan have gone for lemon and elderflower cake covered with buttercream and fresh flowers, to capture the ‘bright flavours of Spring.’  🎥 Watch as baker Claire Ptak begins work on the #RoyalWedding Cake! pic.twitter.com/OTdcF9hc0a — The Royal Family (@RoyalFamily) May 18, 2018  Bridesmaids and pageboys weren't just from the royal side.  Getty Images  The royal protocol card is a pretty hefty one, and it has meant in the past that it trumps every aspect of a royal wedding. This usually means that most if not all of the bridesmaids and page boys are pulled from the royal pool.  Apart from Pippa Middleton, this was even the case as recently as William and Kate’s wedding in 2011, where all seven of the junior attendants were connected to William. However with Harry and Meghan, it was an entirely even split, with three of the six bridesmaids and two of the four page boys connected to the bride.  The bride wasn't be given away by her father.  Getty Images  Lest we forget. . . This is the one rule-bend that Harry and Meghan most definitely didn’t want, but the rollercoaster of events relating to Meghan’s side of the family in the lead up to her big day meant that there was a significant departure from the royal norm. Meghan’s father Thomas Markle was due to walk his daughter down the aisle, but after suffering a heart-attack and undergoing subsequent surgery three days before the wedding, he wasn’t well enough to fly, and in a surprise twist it was be Prince Charles who did the honors.

"'The Good Doctor' Season 2 News: Will Shaun Return to Practice After His Surgical Mishap?  Email Print Whatsapp Menu Whatsapp Google Reddit Digg Stumbleupon Linkedin  After his major surgical mishap at the end of season 1, Dr. Shaun Murphy (Freddie Highmore) is expected to go through a lot of changes when ""The Good Doctor"" returns for season 2.  In the first season finale, Shaun accidentally hit a patient's aortic wall in the middle of a surgery because he was thinking about the toy scalpel that his late brother Steve gave him, which he thought he lost. The incident almost caused the patient's life.  But even if the patient survived, Shaun opted to admit his mistake to San Jose St. Bonaventure Hospital's chief of surgery Dr. Marcus Andrews (Hill Harper). This will put his and his mentor Dr. Aaron Glassman's (Richard Schiff) licenses in danger.  In an interview with TVLine, showrunner David Shore talked about the Shaun and Glassman's fate in ""The Good Doctor"" season 2.  According to Shore, they have always planned for the ending since the pilot of the show. ""It's important to me that Shaun not just be a superhero with autism, but be a real person with strengths and weaknesses,"" Shore stated.  The showrunner also mentioned that he wanted Shaun to showcase his excellent skills as a doctor with autism, but also show that he is capable of making both major and minor mistakes.  The finale also reiterated Glassman's promise in the premiere episode that he will give up his job as the president of the hospital if Shaun will not live up to the expectations. ""You know, if you show a gun in Act 1, it has to be fired in Act 4. That [promise], to me, was the equivalent of a gun, and I wanted to see Shaun make a mistake,"" he also said.  Shore also mentioned that fans could expect to see Shaun working back at the hospital when the series returns for its sophomore season. ""I think the focus [of Season 2] is going to be that there's a new hierarchy — a new sheriff in town,"" he also stated.  On the other hand, executive producer Daniel Day Kim also teased that there are a lot of things to look forward to in the second season during his interview with E! News before the show's panel at the PaleyFest.  ""David [Shore] has some really wonderful things in store,"" Kim stated. ""Some really nice character turns. Freddie [Highmore]'s journey—Shaun's journey—is going to have a couple of twists and turns that I find incredibly compelling,"" he added.  Shore also said in the same interview that he wants to continue exploring the same things and issues where Shaun will be thrown in different situations where he will be challenged. ""Because I think the show superficially is about Dr. Murphy learning how to navigate the world, but I think on a deeper level, the show is much more of what Dr. Murphy has to teach us,"" he also stated.  Fans should also expect to see the series talk about Glassman's cancer in the second season of the medical drama.  ""The Good Doctor"" is expected to return to ABC later this year."	1
    Date night! Newlyweds Jason Momoa and Lisa Bonet attended their first red carpet together on Monday, November 13, since Us Weekly exclusively revealed that they got married.  Bonet, 49, supported the Game of Thrones alum, 38, during the premiere of his new film, Justice League, in Hollywood. Momoa held Bonet’s left hand on the red carpet and was spotted sweetly caressing her wedding ring. “We’ve kind of been married, it’s just that we had a really great celebration, been around the world working and finally had the time to get together and bring all the tribes together,” he told Extra at the event. “So it was really just a celebration of our love, the twelve years.”  Momoa was joined by many of his costars at The Dolby Theater, including Ben Affleck, Henry Cavill, Gal Gadot, Amber Heard, Ezra Miller and Ray Fisher.  Earlier this month, Us exclusively revealed that Momoa and Bonet secretly tied the knot in October, despite it being widely believed for years that they already were husband and wife.  “Jason Momoa and Lisa Bonet had an official wedding a few weeks ago at their house in Topanga, California,” an insider told Us. “Apparently they weren’t officially married until then! They said they ‘made it official.'” A second source confirmed that they purchased a marriage license from the Los Angeles County Registrar-Recorder/County Clerk’s office on October 2.  The couple began dating in 2005 and are parents of Lola, 10, and Nakoa-Wolf, 8. Bonet is also mom of Zoë Kravitz, whom she shares with ex-husband Lenny Kravitz.  Momoa confirmed the nuptials after Us broke the news. “Some a–hole leaked it and I will find you,” he joked to Entertainment Tonight.	1

"Pippa Middleton, always the chic wedding guest, brought her style A-game yet again on Saturday when she attended the nuptials of Lady Gabriella Windsor.  For the occasion, Duchess Kate's little sister donned a light blue floral Kate Spade dress. She paired the springy look with a preppy headband (instead of the usual fascinator), a pair of blue shoes, and gorgeous earrings that appear to be made from diamonds and sapphires. If you're just as in with love the look as we are, you're in luck—a few sizes are still available online at a discounted price (down to $638 from $798).  Lady Gabriella—who is Prince William and Prince Harry's second cousin on their dad's, side—wed her longtime partner Thomas Kingston at St. George's Chapel. The bride wore a long sleeve gown by Italian designer Luisa Beccaria, which was decorated in beautifully intricate lace. ""I've been in love with her dresses for a long time and I'm so lucky to have my dream dress designed by her,"" the bride said of the designer. ""She and her team are exceptional and I'm thrilled with the stunning result of the artistry."" She topped off her wedding day look with a long veil and the same tiara her grandmother wore on her own wedding day. She carried a white and cream bouquet, and Kingston wore a boutonniere of white roses pinned to his lapel.  Mark Cuthbert  While neither Kate Middleton nor Meghan Markle were able to make it to the event (who, like Pippa Middleton, both always serve up A+ wedding guest attire), there were plenty of members of the royal family in attendance. The Queen and Prince Philip were there, as was Prince Harry, who took some time off from new dad duties to watch his cousin walk down the aisle just before his own one-year anniversary."	1
"Your life just got exponentially better and more stylish now you've signed up for our newsletter. Fabulousness awaits!  It's that time of year — where love is clearly in the air! And even Drew Barrymore isn't safe! The Blended star was spotted getting cozy with ex-husband Will Kopelman, leaving the world wondering if they are getting back together? The couple, who split in 2016 after four years of marriage, have been spending nights together, an insider tells In Touch.  “When Drew was filming Santa Clarita Diet, Will would fly into LA from NYC. Even though he had a hotel room, he ended up sleeping at Drew’s house from time to time. Then when she finished shooting in October, it became a more regular thing. They enjoy each other’s company,” revealed the insider.  (Photo Credit: Getty Images)  “They’re both in great places in their lives,” says an insider. Spending so much time together has reminded Drew, 42, and Will, 40 — who share daughters Olive, 5, and Frankie, 3 — of the way things used to be. “It’s like it was at the beginning of their relationship, so relaxed and comfortable,” says the insider, adding that a reconciliation “is a real possibility.”  Drew revealed that she felt like the ""biggest failure"" after announcing her divorce. ""Like, when you get divorced, you break up with somebody and you're like, 'Yeah, that didn't work,' and you get divorced, [but] when you get divorced you're like, 'I'm the biggest failure. This is the biggest failure.' It's so shameful and hard to actually go through that, even privately.""  This isn't the Never Been Kissed star's first divorce.

The Big Bang Theory is going out on top. Despite recent remarks by CBS that it was in talks for more seasons of the highly-rated series, the network, producing studio Warner Bros. TV and executive producer Chuck Lorre just announced that the comedy will end its run in May 2019 with its upcoming 12th season. The Big Bang Theory still will rank as the longest-running multi-camera series in television history per WBTV, spanning 12 seasons and a record-breaking 279 episodes, .  Primetime-Panic Your Complete Guide to Pilots and Straight-to-Series orders See All  “We are forever grateful to our fans for their support of The Big Bang Theory during the past twelve seasons. We, along with the cast, writers and crew, are extremely appreciative of the show’s success and aim to deliver a final season, and series finale, that will bring The Big Bang Theory to an epic creative close,” WBTV, CBS and Chuck Lorre Productions said in a joint statement.  CBS  The announcement about The Big Bang Theory coming to an end comes just two weeks after CBS Entertainment president Kelly Kahl said at TCA that “we don’t believe it’s the final season; we are in preliminary discussions to renew the show with the studio that produces it, Warner Bros.”  I hear conversations about a possible two-year renewal were going on as recently as late last week.  Eleven seasons in, The Big Bang Theory remains one of the biggest shows on television. Season 11 averaged 18.9 million viewers, even with Season 10. It was the second most watched series of last season, edging Sunday Night Football and only behind the now-canceled Roseanne. Among adults 18-49, Big Bang slipped a bit (4.4 in Live+7 vs. 4.9 last season) but still ranked as the second highest-rated entertainment program behind only NBC’s This Is Us.  According to sources, the decision to end the series was largely a creative one made by the producers. It was perceived that Season 12 would be the show’s last when CBS in 2017 renewed Big Bang for seasons 11 and 12 after WBTV had closed new two-year deals with the cast. But then few expected that Big Bang would remain as strong in the ratings as it’s been, maintaining its viewership and top standing in the rankings when most broadcasting series have been sliding.  To go beyond 12 seasons, Warner Bros. TV would’ve had to negotiate new contracts with the actors. The show’s original quintet are the highest-paid actors on TV with paychecks of around $1 million an episode.  REX/Shutterstock  There are no deals in place for next season between CBS and WBTV, between the studio and the cast as well as between the studio and the series’ creative staff. While this was not a business call as CBS and WBTV would’ve likely reached an agreement for more seasons, I hear that, with so many unknowns and not clear whether everyone wanted to come back, the producers had no desire to continue with the show creatively without the entire family on the show intact.  That and the lure of leaving on top, as the highest-rated comedy on television, having achieved the milestone of longest-running multi-camera sitcom, sealed the decision to end the series.  The final season of The Big Bang Theory will debut Monday, September 24 on CBS before moving to its regular time period on Thursday, September 27.  “The Big Bang Theory has been the defining comedy of its generation,” Kahl said today. “All of us at the Network take exceptional pride in this series that uniquely combines creative genius, commercial ratings success, cultural influence and characters who became so popular, they are easily known by just one name. We’re incredibly grateful for our partnership with Warner Bros., Chuck Lorre Productions and a brilliant cast and crew that has made such a ‘big bang’ and lasting legacy on the television landscape.”  .

"There's nothing worse than spending tons of time meticulously curling your hair before an event, only to end up with frizzy curls, weird pieces sticking out, an embarrassingly outdated style, or worse...limp locks because your curls didn't even last half an hour. Luckily, we've compiled a list of curling iron errors to avoid so you can achieve gorgeous waves this summer.  Mistake: Not Prepping Your Hair  In order to get a good curl, you need to prep your hair first. ""It's like building a house,"" says celebrity hairstylist Patrick Melville. ""You have to create a good foundation for it to hold."" To do this, first use a heat-protecting product (it's essential to prevent damage), then blow-dry your hair completely. This will close the cuticle and help hold your curls, as well as avoid heat damage from using the iron on damp hair. Melville also suggests using a styling glaze pre-ironing (he likes Hantz Professional Styling Glaze, $10 hantzprofessional.com) for control and texture. Also, if you know your hair has a really hard time holding a curl, go ahead and mist your hair with a little hairspray before you use the iron.  Mistake: Curling Your Hair in the Wrong Direction  Make your desired part before you start curling, as this will help determine which way you curl the hair. For a more natural look, you'll want to curl your hair away from your face. This means winding the hair down and around the wand of the curling iron in a clockwise direction on the right side of your face and a counter-clockwise direction on the left side.  This is the right way to curl your hair:  Mistake: Twirling the Iron Instead of Your Hair  Most women clip their ends into the iron, then twist the iron in toward their head. According to Melville, this will give you more of a barrel curl (think Shirley Temple) or flip (think Farrah Fawcett), rather than the more natural-looking wave you were probably going for. To achieve that, hold the iron so the barrel (the hot part) is facing down toward the floor, then wrap your hair around it, starting from the roots and locking your ends in last. This will not only make your curls last longer, but it will also give you more volume at the roots. Also, make sure you don't twist the hair at all before winding it around the barrel, as this will prevent the heat from distributing evenly on the hair. Think of your hair as a ribbon, and lay it flat over the curling iron as you wind.  Mistake: Using an Iron That's Too Large  You might own four different-sized curling irons, thinking you need each one to achieve a range of tighter or looser curls. The truth is, you really only need one. ""You can do a lot more with a one-inch barrel than you can do with a larger one,"" says Melville. ""It's more universal. If you want a looser wave, just take a slightly larger section of hair.""  Mistake: Curling Too Much Hair at a Time  While taking a slightly larger section of hair may provide you with a looser wave, curling too much hair at a time isn't a good idea, either, says Melville. You won't get an even distribution of heat throughout that section, which can cause your curls to do a disappearing act. For the most natural look, wrap small sections of hair around the barrel of your iron using the technique described above (and make sure the sections aren't all exactly the same size—your curls will look more natural this way).  Mistake: Buying a Curling Iron That's on Clearance  If you curl your hair frequently, you should invest in a good iron with a ceramic barrel. Also, there's a difference between spring hinge irons and marcel irons with a swivel handle. Even though it might take some getting used to, Melville recommends going for a marcel iron because the clip on a spring can cause unwanted creases in your curls. The marcel iron can also stand in for those wand-like curling irons with no clip at all—just wind your hair around the iron and hold it by the ends. Melville recommends leaving the ends out of the iron completely to get a m"	1
"For those wondering how much Taylor Swift is still enjoying keeping her love life almost completely private, People has an update. Apparently t's still awesome being semi-secretly with British boyfriend of over a year, Joe Alwyn. “She seems to be in a great place both career and love wise,” a source told the outlet. Alwyn tries to attend her concert dates when he can, the source added. Footage of him there hasn't really been shared on social media, except for at the first show—a testament to how undercover these two can keep things.  Alwyn is really the best though, the source made abundantly clear: “Joe is just an amazing boyfriend. He is very supportive. Taylor adores his family. She’s in a very good place.”  Swift and Alwyn were last photographed out together on a North London pub date at the end of May. And that outing was rare itself: Swift has only been photographed out with Alwyn a couple times and has never spoken about him besides in her songs.  Last August, a source told People that this whole keeping the relationship out of the press thing really works for her. ""Her decision to keep her relationship with Joe quiet is making her happy,"" the source said then. ""They have been getting to know each other slowly without any pressure.”  In People's new report today, its source also mentioned that Swift “has a few days off for July 4th” but gave no indication whether she'd throw the usual Taymerica party for her celeb friends at her Rhode Island estate. She didn't last year, but the year before, it was truly a ""I Heart TS"" spectacle."	1
Prince Harry has disclosed that he sought counselling after enduring two years of “total chaos” while still struggling in his late twenties to come to terms with the death of his mother.  The Prince says in an interview with The Telegraph that he “shut down all his emotions” for almost two decades after losing his mother, Diana, Princess of Wales, despite his brother, Prince William, trying to persuade him to seek help.  Disclosing that he has spoken to a professional about his mental health, he describes how he only began to address his grief when he was 28 after feeling “on the verge of punching someone” and facing anxiety during royal engagements.	1
Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  As rumors continued to mount about an alleged affair between Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence, Anna Faris recalled feeling self-conscious amid speculation about her eight-year union with the “Passengers” leading man.  “Even before they met in person, my publicist, out of the blue, pulled me aside and said, ‘Anna, listen, there are going to be paparazzi all over them,'” Faris penned in her newly released memoir, “Unqualified.”  “There are going to be shots of them laughing together on their way to the set. There are going to be stories circulating, and you have to brace yourself for this.”  Though Faris, 40, didn’t think it would bother her, as Pratt, 38, had worked with Aubrey Plaza on “Parks and Recreation” and Bryce Dallas Howard in “Jurassic World,” the “Mom” actress noted how the “false rumors” made her feel “insecure.”  “Jennifer and I are really friendly, and she was apologetic even though she didn’t need to be, because she hadn’t done anything wrong,” Faris described. “She’s awesome, but of course it’s hurtful and also embarrassing when people are saying your husband is cheating on you, even if it’s patently untrue. You still feel, and look, like a fool.”  Following a Star magazine report from 2015, Faris said she felt “blindsided” by rumors of Pratt’s infidelity.  “We have an incredible relationship, it has been weirdly stinging,” Faris told Us Weekly at the time. “This has been blindsiding to us.”  Despite their united front, Faris and Pratt announced in August they were legally separating.  “We tried hard for a long time, and we’re really disappointed,” the former pair posted on Facebook. “Our son has two parents who love him very much, and for his sake we want to keep this situation as private as possible moving forward.”  Faris and Pratt, who share 5-year-old son Jack, have since gone their separate ways. The “Scary Movie” heroine has been spotted with cinematographer Michael Barrett.	1

"""CBS This Morning"" co-anchor Gayle King might have to leave the program if her longtime friend and confidant Oprah Winfrey runs for president, media watchers suggested Tuesday.  King’s close relationship with Winfrey would present a potentially significant conflict of interest that could undermine public confidence in CBS’s reporting, several commentators said.  The two women have been good friends since they both worked at a Baltimore television station in their early 20s.  On Tuesday, CBS anchors Norah O'Donnell and Jeff Glor interviewed King about Winfrey’s plans on ""CBS This Morning,"" without mentioning the close relationship between the two women.  King, who attended the Golden Globe Awards ceremony Sunday night and spent several hours with Winfrey afterward, said her friend was intrigued by the idea of a candidacy, but didn't think she was ""actively considering"" it.  King added that ""there are people who have said they want to be her campaign manager, who want to quit their jobs and campaign for her.""  GAYLE KING: 'I ABSOLUTELY DON'T THINK THAT HER POSITION HAS CHANGED'  Tim Graham, director of media analysis for the conservative watchdog Media Research Center, said King's job ""is like having an Oprah press spokesperson on staff. She's helping Oprah milk the speculation for all it's worth.""  If Winfrey’s candidacy becomes real, ""Gayle's gotta leave,"" declared CNN's morning host, Chris Cuomo.  ""I have the right to change my opinion,"" added Cuomo, whose brother -- New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo -- has been mentioned as a potential 2020 presidential contender. ""Does she have to leave? Maybe she does. I guess they could do the coverage in a way where she never handles it. But it would raise questions with people.""  CBS will address the apparent conflict of interest if it becomes a problem, CBS News President David Rhodes said.  ""It's difficult to be part of the news when you cover the news and she helped people understand what was going on with the story,"" Rhodes said.  King's insight is useful as long as chatter about Winfrey's candidacy is a parlor game and not reality, said Al Tompkins, an instructor in broadcast journalism for the Poynter Institute.  ""The relationship between King and Winfrey is well known and viewers can filter what they hear from Gayle through that filter,"" Tompkins said. ""If Oprah did run, it would be a tougher relationship to navigate. ... Today, with so many people being so skeptical or cynical of what they see, hear and read in journalism, the cleaner we can keep the lines between journalists and politicians the better.""  Mark Feldstein, a journalism professor at the University of Maryland, said CBS News would have to take King off campaign stories if Winfrey were to run. That could be awkward for the show's format; the three hosts often sit at a table and discuss stories or interview newsmakers together. (King and O'Donnell will soon be joined by John Dickerson, whom CBS named Tuesday as the replacement for Charlie Rose, who left ""CBS This Morning"" in November after allegations of sexual misconduct.)  ""The public needs to be assured that the news they get is as objective as humanly possible,"" Feldstein said. ""That obviously is not the case if an anchor is reporting on a close friend.""  The Associated Press contributed to this report."	1

One February day in 2004, Maura Murray climbed into her car and drove away from her dorm room at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. She headed north, her destination unknown. As night descended, a local in New Hampshire caught one last glimpse of Maura and her wrecked vehicle along a desolate stretch of Route 112.  By the time police responded to the crash, Maura was gone, seemingly vanished into thin air. Maura Murray’s disappearance shocked her family and friends. Nearly 14 years later, the cold case continues to baffle authorities, armchair detectives, and internet sleuths around the world. It has inspired everything from books and podcasts, to an increasingly bizarre web of conspiracy theories and true crime message board threads. Yet the mystery remains: What do we truly know about the disappearance of 21-year-old Maura Murray? Last weekend, Oxygen launched its own investigation into the Maura Murray case with a six-part series called The Disappearance of Maura Murray. Investigative journalist Maggie Freleng helms the search, enlisting the help of former U.S. Marshal Art Roderick as they trace the details of the baffling case. You can catch up on the first episode HERE. We plan to follow Oxygen’s investigation very closely. In the spirit of the pursuit, here’s what we know about Maura Murray’s life and her mysterious disappearance.  A Bright Life  Photo Credit: Oxygen  On the surface, Maura Murray’s life seemed ideal. She was a promising student at the University of Massachusetts Amherst in pursuit of a nursing degree; she came from a loving family, and shared a strong relationship with her boyfriend of a few years. Yet all was not as it seemed. In November 2003, around three months before her disappearance, Maura was caught fraudulently using a credit card number that was not her own. The young woman had to have been desperate—she used the card only to order pizza, charging less than $80.  Want more disappearance cases?

Subscribe I would like to receive newsletters and special offers from Murder & Mayhem (fictional mysteries and thrillers).  Then, on February 7, 2004, two days before her disappearance, Maura’s father Fred arrived in Amherst, Massachusetts for a visit. Maura borrowed her father’s car to go to a party. Around 3:30 A.M., while driving back to Fred’s room at the Quality Inn, Maura hit a guardrail on Route 9. The police responded to the scene, but they didn’t perform a sobriety test. Maura may have believed that these encounters with the law would tarnish her professional record, thus threatening her dreams of becoming a nurse. Some sleuths point to this as a motive for Maura to disappear of her own volition. The theory seems extreme—Fred Murray does not buy it. Since there was no ticket cited at the scene of the crash, there would be no reason for Maura to believe this was the end of the line. Nevertheless, something changed in Maura after the crash that night.  Preparing for Departure  Photo Credit: Oxygen  In the early hours of February 9, Maura researched and printed out MapQuest directions to two different locations: one set that led to the Berkshires, the other to Burlington, Vermont. Throughout the day, she also phoned vacation rentals in the northeast, inquiring about availabilities. Nothing was booked. Then Maura’s messages took a dark turn. She wrote to her professors and work supervisors stating that she would be away from campus for a week. The reason? There was an unexpected death in the Murray family. No such death had occurred. At approximately 3:30 P.M., Maura Murray got in her car and left the UMass Amherst campus. Inside her vehicle were clothes, toiletries, some textbooks, and her birth control pills. Soon after her departure, Maura was recorded withdrawing $280 from a nearby ATM. She then entered a liquor store, where she purchased wine, coffee liqueur, and vodka. Security cameras capt	1
"“ No Troll left behind! „ ~ King Peppy  King Peppy is a king troll and the former ruler of the Pop Trolls. King Peppy is Princess Poppy's father, Trolls.  Contents show]  Appearance  King Peppy is a orange troll that has pink hair with grey streaks in it. He has a yellow nose, a green hug time bracelet and possibly brown eyes. He also has a pink Vera which has grey Speaks in it too. He wears a green and blue waistcoat and he also wears green trousers. In one scene though he is spotted wearing only his White Boxers.  Personality  According to the Trolls DVD extra, he was originally going to be a crazy old man by the time the current Trolls storyline had begun, not even able to recognise when people were talking about him. This idea was dropped in favour of him being a wise teacher to Poppy. Some scenes of him as the senile old man still remain in the movie despite the rewrite of his character.  King Peppy, as the brave leader of the Pop Trolls, led his people on a torch-lit escape to freedom from Bergen Town. His heroism and valor were the stuff of Troll legend. Quick with inspirational words of wisdom, King Peppy ushered in a new era of happiness and security in Troll Village.  Now it’s 20 years later, and King Peppy has become a grandfatherly elder statesman to the Trolls. A tad dottier and forgetful than he was as a young man, King Peppy brings some unintentional humor to the Trolls, but is still beloved by everyone in Troll Village, and his legacy lives on in his daughter Poppy.  King Peppy is shown as a wise teacher in Trolls: The Beat Goes On! and has sage advice on things. Though he has his eccentric side as well. For example in the episode Royal Review he gives his daughter a frowny face in the primary vote to teach her a lesson, though he isn't clear what the lesson was himself. As he stated ""I'm old, I do what I want"".  Relationships  Princess Poppy is the daughter of King Peppy. King Peppy gets anxious and worried when Princess Poppy tells him that she would be going on a journey to find her friends and tries to stop her, however Princess Poppy does not listen.  History  Trolls  20 years ago on the last Trollstice, he freed the Trolls from Bergen Town and lead them to freedom. They rebuilt their civilisation deep within the forest away from the town.  20 years later Princess Poppy threw a party to celebrate her father's efforts. However, the loud party attracted the Bergen Chef who took The Snack Pack save Poppy. King Peppy, being too old to fight the Bergens, wanted to run away but Poppy insisted she went after her friends. Peppy tried to stop hi daughter, but he refused much to his dismay.  He and the other Trolls hid in Branch's Survival Bunker (much to his dismay) while she went off to save her friends.  Later he hears his daughter's cowbell playind causing the other trolls and him to come out of higing, only to find Creek was the one playing it and as a consequence be captured by the Bergens lead by Chef.  At Bergen Castle the entire Troll village is thrown into a pot where he and Poppy are reunited. Poppy however is sad as her attempts to save her friends lead to the entire village being captured. She looses her colour and becomes grey, then the entire village including Peppy looses theirs. Branch manages to bring back Poppy's colours using song which causes the other Trolls to get theirs back.  Bridget, a Bergen that Poppy had befriended during her rescue attempt sets the Trolls free and they make a bid for Troll Village. Poppy goes back to save Bridget as she had sacrificed herself for their sake.  Poppy manages to convince the Bergens not to eat the Trolls by showing them they can be happy without eating Trolls. At the end of the movie, he steps down as ruler and crowns his daughter Queen Poppy.  Merchandise  Official Website  He ​led the great Troll escape from the Bergens 20 years ago.  He never leaves a Troll behind.  King Peppy’s a bit absent-minded — but if he ever misplaces anything, it’s usually stuck"	1

"It is weirdly satisfying when your favorite TV couple ends up together off-screen. Real romance just elevates your OTP to a whole new level, so it is no surprise that many Full House fans have always wondered whether Aunt Becky and Uncle Jesse ever dated in real life. Or, in other words, whether Lori Loughlin and John Stamos ever dated in real life. It's a fair question to ask: Their chemistry has always been off the charts thanks to their wicked onscreen banter skills. Together, they gave Full House its one great romance. But, were Loughlin and Stamos ever as madly in love with each other as their characters were and will continue to be on Netflix's Fuller House?  Well, the short answer is no. The stars never quite aligned for Loughlin and Stamos, but they may or may not have had a date at the most magical place on Earth — aka, Disneyland — depending on which one of them you ask.  In an interview with People magazine, Loughlin revealed Stamos invited her to see a band play in Disneyland way before their Full House days. At the time, they were both young actors just starting out in the business who also happened to be friends. Loughlin agreed to accompany Stamos to Disneyland, but she told People, she was never quite sure if their friendly outing counted as a true date. While she tends to think no, Stamos is firmly in the ""it was a real date"" camp, and they have been arguing over the semantics for years. ""We fight internally about that,"" Loughlin told People. ""I'm like, 'Was that a date?' He's like, 'Yeah!'""  What makes Stamos so sure it was a date? Well, there was definitely kissing involved, according to him. ""As I recall, we ended up kissing,"" Stamos said. ""That sounds like a date, right?"" Have mercy! That definitely sounds date like to me, but that could just be my inner Uncle Jesse and Aunt Becky shipper talking. Also, just take a moment to appreciate how these two bicker like an old married couple.  Anyway, it looks like that one maybe-date in their teens will have to satisfy the cravings of Full House fans looking for a real life romance between the duo. By the time Loughlin joined Full House she was married to her first husband, Michael R. Burns — and by the time Loughlin and Burns were divorced, Stamos was married to Rebecca Romijn. Now Stamos is single, but Loughlin has been happily married to Mossimo Giannulli for 18 years, and the couple has two daughters.  As cool as a real life romance between Aunt Becky and Uncle Jesse would have been, it's even better knowing the actors are still friends. Plus, the love between their characters will live on in Fuller House and as a committed Aunt Becky/Uncle Jesse shipper there is no better news than that.  Images: Warner Bros.

Two months ago, Netflix green-lit a reboot of Sabrina the Teenage Witch for two seasons. And now the OG Sabrina Spellman, Melissa Joan Hart, is sharing her take on the “totally different” revival.  During a recent interview with E! News, Hart explained that fans of the original show may be surprised (in a good way) when they watch The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. She said, “I think what they’re doing is smart, doing the darker version. I think it’s going to be more like Buffy the Vampire Slayer than the Sabrina that most people know.”  The 41-year-old went on to reveal that she won’t be involved in the remake, like, at all, considering her entertainment company was completely removed from the Netflix reboot. She added, “It’s an Archie comic, so the rights reverted from my company, Hartbreak Films, back to them. It’s a totally different show.”  Nevertheless, Hart is looking forward to seeing Kiernan Shipka portray the beloved Sabrina Spellman…and so are we.  The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina will hit Netflix sometime in 2019.  RELATED: ‘Bad Moms’ Is Getting An Unscripted Series and, Yeah, It’s Going to Be Good	1

Chris Brown has been named in a lawsuit filed by a woman who alleges that she was sexually assaulted at the singer’s California home by Brown’s friend.  The lawsuit, filed on behalf of “Jane Doe” by lawyer Gloria Allred, claims that the “young woman” was raped several times at Brown’s home by Lowell Grissom, a rapper who performs under the names Young Lo and EverybodyKnowsLo.  “The lawsuit alleges that while she was at Brown’s house, plaintiff became the victim of horrific sexual assaults which are described in our lawsuit,” Allred said in a statement. “That is why we have filed this case today alleging sexual battery, gender violence, a violation of Ralph Civil Rights Act, battery, assault, interference with the exercise of civil rights, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligence.”  Doe also alleges that another woman – named Doe X in the lawsuit as the plaintiff has yet to ascertain the woman’s name – physically forced Jane Doe into giving her oral sex.  “To compound Plaintiff’s horror, Doe X was menstruating at the time,” the complaint reads. “While Doe X was forcing Plaintiff to perform oral sex on her, Grissom molested the lower half of Plaintiff’s body using his mouth and hands. Thus, Plaintiff found herself being sexually battered by two people at the same time.”  The lawsuit continues, “When Plaintiff realized that Doe X had menstruated on her face, Plaintiff decided that for health reasons, she needed to wash herself immediately. Grissom entered the bathroom while Plaintiff was in the shower, and began to molest her. Plaintiff fled the bathroom, but Grissom pursued her, and pushed her down onto the bed and raped her.”  Popular on Rolling Stone  According to the lawsuit, following a concert at Los Angeles’ 1Oak on February 23rd, 2017, Brown hosted an after-party at a recording studio, which Jane Doe and other female friends were invited to attend. Doe added that, upon entering Brown’s home, Grissom allegedly confiscated her cellphone; Brown has previously faced legal issues stemming from a confiscated cellphone at his house.  Jane Doe alleges that Grissom refused to return her phone and instead brought the cellphone back to Brown’s residence, forcing Doe and her then-roommate to go to Brown’s house to retrieve their phones.  “This is one of the most horrific cases involving alleged sexual assaults that I have ever seen, and our client, Jane Doe, has been severely traumatized by what she was forced to suffer,” Allred said in a statement. “She filed this lawsuit because she wants justice for herself, but she also wants to warn other young women about the potential danger to themselves if they have their phone taken away and if they go to Chris Brown’s house.”  “Once at Brown’s house, Brown and Grissom continued to refuse to give Plaintiff back her phone and did not allow Plaintiff to leave,” the lawsuit alleges. “At Brown’s house, Brown continued to furnish alcohol and illicit drugs to his guests and/or the guests consumed drugs that they carried onto the premises. Plaintiff believes that the drugs Brown provided to his guests or that were brought by his guests were or included cocaine, ‘Molly,’ and marijuana.” Jane Doe claimed she turned down a “clear pill filled with white powder” that Brown handed her. Doe also “observed Brown carrying one gun in his waistband and brandishing it openly.”  When Jane Doe showed reluctance to strip naked and perform sexual acts on Grissom, Doe X, according to the suit, “violently grabbed Plaintiff by the throat and forced Plaintiff to perform oral sex on Grissom.”  After Grissom finally gave Jane Doe back her phone, she says she called a ridesharing service. However, Doe claims that Grissom again raped her in a “laundry room” before she exited Brown’s residence. Upon leaving, Doe “went to a rape treatment center and to the police where she reported the aforementioned events.”  The LAPD declined to confirm any details in the lawsuit, but Officer Norma Eisenman tells Rolli	1

A statement on behalf of Lynn was released on her official Facebook page:  “American country music legend Loretta Lynn was admitted into a hospital in Nashville last night after she suffered a stroke at her home in Hurricane Mills, Tennessee.

Any questions about whether or not The Weeknd and Bella Hadid are officially back on have now been answered, as the pair were snapped embracing each other in Paris last week.  They don't call it the city of love for nothin! Aside from their adorbs PDA, the pair have also taken their rekindled romance over to Instagram (kinda).  Hit play on the video to see the celebs who got back with their ex...  Bella and The Weeknd (AKA Abel Tesfaye) looked more in love than ever as they strolled the streets in matching black ensembles after grabbing lunch together at a local cafe.  @backgriduk  While the snap is all we need to know that Abella 2.0 is officially a go, there have been a few subtle appearances over on the 'gram that have totally solidified the evidence.  The Weeknd took to his story to post a snap of a sugar sachet with the words 'Sugar Daddy', but the fresh nails in the picture definitely don't belong to him.  Instagram/TheWeeknd  In fact, we're pretty sure they belong to Bella since she posted a pic of herself donning the precise same flawless nails.  Furthermore, the pair can be linked via a jar of pasta sauce (hear us out!).  Bella Hadid posted a couple of pics to Insta, the first of her posing with some roses and the second with a giant jar of pasta sauce balancing on her head.  Then Abel took to Instagram to post a snap of his finished plate, but over in the corner is the precise same jar of pasta sauce (yep, just call us Sherlock)  Date night! We're going to go ahead and assume that the roses and the sauce were a cute gift for Bella, and we're seriously respecting his choice. Roses are great and all, but can you think of a better/more practical pressie than a family size jar of Pomodoro?  Instagram/TheWeeknd  Seriously though, it looks like the pair are having the best Paris rendezvous, and we're so happy to see them giving it another shot.  We could just feel it coming!	1

"Selena Gomez has had exactly the opposite of what I'd call a casual year. She's been consistently churning out some of 2017's best songs, rebounding in a big way after her breakup with The Weeknd, recovering from a life saving surgery, and now she's performing at the American Music Awards as if she hasn't just undergone a truly insane few months. NOT A BIG DEAL. Selena Gomez's 2017 AMAs performance proves this woman can do anything, no matter what life throws at her.  Just when we all thought it was all ""Bad Liar"" music video parties and ""Fetish"" sexy-times for Gomez, we found out that, JK!, she's actually undergone a kidney transplant procedure in the middle of simultaneously pushing her new music to the masses. Talk about intense.  Gomez revealed in early September that her best friend Francia Raisa donated her kidney to help save her life, which came as a huge shock to her fans. While Gomez was busy laying low in recovery, the public was oblivious to her situation and soaking up hit after hit. We were just low-key getting down with our bad selves to her new, sultry and sexy tracks.  Then in early October, more shocking news broke that her ten month relationship with The Weeknd had ended, and fans started freaking out all over again. First of all, now everything we've thought to be true about love and relationships feels like a lie, and second... SELENA, ARE YOU OK?  Yes, guy. Yes she is. Tonight's performance proves it.  Gomez stepped (rolled) onto the stage and sang her heart out to her new hit, ""Wolves."" The song was in collaboration with DJ Marshmello, and the performance was true fire. This is the first time Gomez has performed since announcing her kidney transplant, and she expertly maneuvered the stage looking as fierce as ever. The audience went crazy for her. While we've had the audio to ""Wolves"" for a little bit of time now, watching her perform it was a totally different animal. (No pun intended.) (Just kidding. Pun intended.)  Fans were also keeping their eyes peeled for glimpses of her on-again boyfriend Justin Bieber, who had four AMA nominations himself. Biebs was nominated twice for Collaboration of the Year, and again in categories Favorite Song — Pop/Rock for ""Despacito"" and Favorite Rap/Hip-hop for his song ""I'm The One.""  Of course, viewers were dying to see Bieber's face when Gomez stepped out on stage in hopes it would finally confirm to the public that they're back together. Earlier this week, photos surfaced of the couple kissing at one of Bieber's hockey games, so we can only imagine that they're 100 percent back on.  Honestly, it looks like their relationship is the real deal and Gomez is giving him another chance. An insider told People magazine,  Justin was Selena’s first love. He will always have a special place in her heart. She’s always held out hope that one day the circumstances and timing would be right.  And it's no surprise Justin has wanted her back all along. The source added,  Spending time together makes them both very happy. For Justin, no one ever came close to comparing to Selena. He always thought she was the most special and now seems mature enough to realize Selena deserves the best.  Hell yeah, she does.  If tonight's performance is any indication, she is feeling better than ever and we can't wait to see what 2018 brings for the pop princess and her love life.

"Sometimes, the universe reaches out to you in mysterious ways. Your Uber account is credited $50. A real live human answers when you dial for customer service. A secret admirer sends your co-worker a dozen Cronuts, and she wants to share. You refresh your inbox and between the spam and the million Bed, Bath & Beyond emails, you find this: ""Master Class: Oprah - Tuesday, October 25 @ 11:30am.""  When the cosmos rewards you beyond your wildest dreams, you do not wait. Reader, you do not wait for the rest of the missive to materialize in your browser. You do not wait for your boss to forward it to you, wanting to know: ""MK u up for this!?"" You do not wait to check your calendar. You RSVP. Because when a goddess, a titan, the bespectacled answer to all the prayers you didn't even know you'd offered up to the heavens above graces the Hearst Tower and invites you to witness it, you do not hesitate.  ""Clear my schedule!"" you cry, except you don't because you're in a crowded area and have no prior engagements, anyway. ""I'm gonna meet Oprah!""  For the next hour, Oprah gave out wisdom like free cars.  Of course, I didn't. Meet her, that is. I didn't even see her—not really.  Despite the fact that I went downstairs to wait in line a full 20 minutes before attendees were supposed to even be allowed to assemble, I found a crowd triple the size of the theater had already gathered by the time I arrive.  A kindly gent let me know that some people had started to hover around 8:30 a.m., pretending to sip coffees on the couches until they were allowed to queue up. At this point, hundreds had trickled in. ""They're streaming on Facebook Live,"" a fellow traveler said. So, I raced up to my desk and plugged in my headphones.  ""Don't @ me!"" I cried, except I didn't, because that doesn't exactly make sense and everyone knew I was in a deep state of focus, anyway. ""I'm gonna watch Oprah!""  And I did.  For the next hour, Oprah gave out wisdom like free cars. She talked disappointment, success, power, and positivity. She copped to bad hair and a bubble bath obsession. She out Kondo'd Marie. She out Jobs'd Steve. She smized so hard Tyra probably shivered a little. And by the time it was over, she'd gobbled up all the advice I've ever been given, tied it in a bow with her teeth, and handed it back to me. It was so impressive, so awesome that I may have blacked out a little. But then I came to and wrote down her seven best lessons so that you, too, can glimpse the divine. Here goes.  Stop dreaming  When Oprah was in her early thirties, she gave up on dreams. That's crazy, you say. It can't be! But it is. ""I stopped dreaming my own dreams,"" she said, ""and realized that God or whatever name you use for God—that energy forcefield in your life, that which is greater than yourself...whatever name you use—I realized that I would be more powerful if I stepped into the dream that creation had for me. I stopped dreaming and I allowed myself to be in the dream that God...had for me. And my life opened up and changed.""  ""You think this is a masterclass? Your entire life is a class.""  Listen, people. Life isn't always going to be a walk in the park, and Oprah gets it. Sometimes, it's hard. Sometimes, it feels like it might break you. But it won't. You can survive it! All that bad stuff that seems like setbacks are opportunities. Let Oprah explain: ""Everything that is happening to you is also happening for you. You think this is a masterclass? Your entire life is a class and every choice and thought you've ever made is a part of a life lesson that is your class here on earth.""  No one can threaten your power (unless you're an egotistical maniac)  Great news! According to Oprah, your power is pretty much absolute. No matter who you are or what you do, you own your power and there isn't a loser on this green earth who can diminish it. Unless!  ""If you feel your power is threatened, it means your ego has risen to a point in which you think you can be threatened,"" said Oprah."	1
Anna Faris definitely has some mixed emotions when it comes to the release of her upcoming memoir, Unqualified!  Faris, who recently split from her husband Chris Pratt, explained that the novel is quite personal. “I feel really, really nervous because it feels intimate,” Faris explained on her podcast. “I’m excited and when I first got the book deal, I thought, ‘What a great adventure this is going to be,’ and now that it’s getting closer, I feel nervous in a sense that I’ve been able to always hide behind characters.” She added, “And now it’s like, this is me. It feels a little scary.”  Anna’s entrance into the literary world has been described as “part memoir, part humorous, unflinching advice” on relationships and “finding love.” Another interesting chapter of the book will come through the foreword which was previously reported by E! News to be written by Chris Pratt.  The biggest question that fans have been wondering is whether Anna will discuss her failed relationship with Pratt. “I couldn’t believe how revealing you were,” her podcast co-host Sim Sarna shared, “because there was so much that you hadn’t told me personally that I read in the book for the first time.”  Although she is thrilled to share this side of herself, the House Bunny actress also admitted she is more terrified than ever. She addressed her fans in the podcast by stating, “Dear listeners,” she began, “I would love it so much if you picked up my book. But please know, I am so scared. I feel like leaving the country for a while. I’m breaking into a sweat as we talk about it.”  Unqualified is set to be released Oct. 24.	1

"Jessica Simpson doesn't not spend $100,000 per month on the food delivery service Postmates, despite an absurd report. Gossip Cop can exclusively debunk the story. A rep for the singer tells us it's ""ridiculous.""  Gregory Pace/REX/Shutterstock  According to RadarOnline, Simpson has become so lazy that she can't be bothered to leave her house to go grocery shopping, so she instead has every meal delivered. An alleged insider tells the blog that the singer has decided to let herself go because she ""feels like her acting career over, she's aged out of Hollywood, and too fat.""  From there, the site drags in Simpson's husband Eric Johnson, saying he's equally slothful and sits around all day ""eating and drinking"" with his wife. ""Their Postmates bill has been $100,000 in one month,"" adds the supposed source. ""They rarely leave their huge mansion. And have everything delivered, no matter what it is!""  This phony story is based on claims from an anonymous and untraceable ""insider,"" but Simpson's own spokesperson tells Gossip Cop on the record that it's ""ridiculous."" We're further told the singer ""has a chef,"" so the idea that she spends six figures a month on takeout food is ""preposterous.""  The additional angle about the singer and her husband being inactive isn't remotely true either. Earlier this year, Simpson revealed on Instagram that she makes sure to take at least 12,000 steps a day. Simpson also told People, ""I walk three miles a day. Eric and I love taking the kids out for long walks in the neighborhood."" A recent Instagram photo of Simpson and her husband going on a hike is just one example of this.  The singer's social media page also includes many images of her engaging in various activities with her husband and kids, such as surfing, swimming and playing tennis. Simpson frequently documents her active life on Instagram, so the blog's claim she never leaves her house is simply baseless. And when she's not spending time with her family, Simpson is busy working on her fashion line, which grosses more than $1 billion in annual sales. The singer didn't build a billion-dollar fashion empire by sitting around her house all day.  Additionally, it's clear that RadarOnline has little insight into the singer's personal life. Gossip Cop busted the blog in April for wrongly reporting that Simpson was pregnant with her third baby. As time has shown, she's not expecting another child. This latest article surrounding a $100,000 delivery bill is equally false.  More on Gossip Cop:  Ben Affleck, Lindsay Shookus getting marrie, starting a family?  Brad Pitt, Margot Robbie NOT in ""new scandal,"" despite report  Anna Faris ""not over"" Chris Pratt is false claim"	0
    Alright, alright, alright — Busy Philipps might just have the best story about Matthew McConaughey ever. The Cougar Town alum, 38, recalled a funny run-in she had with the Oscar winner after the pair reunited during Live! with Kelly and Ryan on Monday, July 31.  Philipps was filling in for Kelly Ripa during the daytime talk show. Afterward, she posted a photo with McConaughey, 47, and Ryan Seacrest on set and dished about the past in the caption.    Matthew McConaughey’s Hottest Shirtless Moments  “Wait. I didn’t get to tell this story cause when you’re hosting, you know, ITS NOT ALL ABOUT YOU. But years ago, at a pre-oscar party when Heath [Ledger] and Michelle [Williams] were both nominated for Brokeback, Matthew McConaughey came up to congratulate them and we were introduced,” the actress wrote.    Michelle Williams’ Hollywood Evolution  “He talked with us for about 10 mins and when he left he said, ‘Heath, Michelle, congratulations and best of luck to you this weekend. Marc, it was nice to meet you. WHIMSY, it was a pleasure!'” she continued. “We obviously didn’t correct him cause who cares?!- he’s Matthew McConaughey! He can call me whatever he wants! But we all just about died. And Michelle to this DAY sometimes calls me Whimsy. And it always makes us laugh. Also. He’s so hot.”  Philipps also reunited with an old pal on Monday. It just so happens, her former Dawson’s Creek costar James Van Der Beek was a guest during the show.	1
    “Earth to Gwyneth,” reads the cover line on Goop’s first ever print issue. They took that literally: The cover features the lifestyle site’s founder and CEO, Gwyneth Paltrow, topless and slathered in mud from head to toe.  The 96-page magazine debut, which retails for a hefty price (like all things Goop) of $15, is the first iteration of a new quarterly publication. Just like the online brand, the book will feature wellness advice, clean beauty secrets, healthy recipes and more.  The Fall 2017 issue, specifically, covers a makeup-bag detox, deep-dives into crystals and mud masks, a do-anywhere workout from fitness guru Tracy Anderson, fall fashion, tips for a better orgasm and a candid conversation with Paltrow, 44, herself.  In one standout story, the actress talks about having bee venom injected into her C-section scar. “The doctor stings you [with a live bee] like it’s an acupuncture needle,” shared the mother of Apple, 13, and Moses, 11 (with ex Chris Martin). “I had it done on my cesarean scar… I had some buckling in the scar, and it really evened it out.”  In the issue’s editor letter, Paltrow also recalls her first-ever cleanse: “I remember standing in a hippie health-food store in Greenwich Village and I saw a little paperback book describing a ‘master cleanse,’ and I was like, ‘What’s that?’ I remember the next day [after I finished the cleanse] I was like, ‘Oh, wow, I just did this cleanse, and I feel so much better. I can have a beer and a cigarette now, right?'”	1

"And just like that, the ghosts of Meredith's past are right there on our television screens once more as a Spanish-language version of Snow Patrol's ""Chasing Cars"" plays in the background. We see George O'Malley in his blue scrubs calling out to his old friend. Lexie Grey is behind the admin desk as Meredith says goodbye to a nurse. Her mother, Dr. Ellis Grey, watches her leave, as Doc the dog follows her down the hallway to…Derek, who says simply, ""Hey"" before Mark Sloane also appears beside him. Ahhhhh, McDreamy and McSteamy together again. I'm not crying—you're crying.  It was good to see them all again, but it also drives home how many important people Meredith has lost over the years. It's incredible that she's still a functional human. Showrunner Krista Vernoff talked to The Hollywood Reporter about the impetus for the episode's little twist. ""I loved the idea because after 15 seasons, it's exciting to be airing on a holiday we've never done an episode about—and because it's the holiday of the community that is being attacked in our country right now by our government and misrepresented,"" she said. ""The holiday is delightful. I had just seen Coco with my daughter—whose name is Coco—and the idea that our loved ones who died can come visit us on this one day of the year was moving. I suggested Meredith's dead people come back and visit her in this episode.""  I was not alone in feeling an emotional gut punch, as evidenced by reactions on social media.  She also reveals that an earlier cut of the episode featured Denny Duquette and Kyle Chandler's bomb squad character, but they didn't feel authentic and were cut. But don't expect to keep seeing those beloved faces regularly. ""This was a Day of the Dead, one-time-only thing,"" Vernoff tells THR. ""The holiday is about the dead visiting the living and the living inviting the dead to come for a visit. So it felt like the perfect opportunity to see the people Meredith has lost.""  When the episode ends, Meredith hasn't called her father…yet. It looks like she's heading in that direction, but as her voice-over notes, she's allowed to handle the situation however she wants. ""Every religion, every country, every culture, death means something different to all of us,"" she says. ""They all have different ideas about how to honor the dead. Different ideas of how to grieve. Different ways of moving on. Well, I may not be an expert but I do have some experience with losing people I love. And I say the right way to grieve is however the hell you want."""	1
"Lili Reinhart Opens Up About Body Dysmorphia After Trolls Criticize Her Appearance  Email Print Whatsapp Menu Whatsapp Google Reddit Digg Stumbleupon Linkedin  ""Riverdale"" star Lili Reinhart shared her disappointment over the bashing that she received from social media due to the way she perceived her body.  The 21-year-old actress talked about dealing with body dysmorphia on Twitter after earning a lot of flak from numerous social media trolls due to her Grace Kelly-inspired spread with Harper's Bazaar that was released on Monday.  The trolls particularly criticized her for saying how Marilyn Monroe inspires her, saying that the legendary actress did not care if she was curvy when she was still alive.  According to Reinhart, people should not tell others that they have no right to feel insecure because their body looked okay.  ""Telling someone they don't deserve to feel insecure because their body is 'fine' or 'just like' whomever.. is wrong,"" the actress tweeted on Monday, July 2. ""That's part of the problem. That's part of body shaming,"" she added.  Telling someone they don’t deserve to feel insecure because their body is “fine” or “just like” whomever.. is wrong. That’s part of the problem. That’s part of body shaming. — Lili Reinhart (@lilireinhart) July 3, 2018  She also added that she cannot understand how people can hide behind their social media accounts and tell another person that their feelings are not valid and should be considered as ""whining"" just because they believe that the other person already showed the ideal shape or figure. In another series of tweets, Reinhart said that she was sad to see other people blatantly tell her what she feels. ""Feeling really disheartened by the fact that so many people are saying 'you're skinny so shut up about embrscing [SIC] your body.' As if my body dysmorphia is irrelevant because of how I look to some people. I'm either not curvy enough or not skinny enough to feel insecure,"" the actress, who is known for portraying the role of Betty Cooper in ""Riverdale,"" stated in her post.  Feeling really disheartened by the fact that so many people are saying “you’re skinny so shut up about embrscing your body.” As if my body dysmorphia is irrelevant because of how I look to some people. I’m either not curvy enough or not skinny enough to feel insecure. — Lili Reinhart (@lilireinhart) July 4, 2018  Mental illness gets worse when people say that you don’t have a right to feel the way you do. That’s where we are dailing. Do not encourage this behavior. It is destructive. More destructive than you’ll ever realize. You may not understand someone’s insecurity- but respect it. — Lili Reinhart (@lilireinhart) July 4, 2018  Mayo Clinic described body dysmorphic disorder as a mental disorder which makes a person believe that there are one or more flaws in their appearance even if others could not see it.  The actress then appealed to her followers to show more respect to others."	1
Photo by Levan TK (LA Weekly).  I’ve come to learn that rituals are treated very similarly to masturbation in society. It’s something everyone does (whether they like to admit it or not), we’re told to be ashamed of their practice, but they both make us feel good. Rituals are a very personal thing, and seldom understood writ large. If you’re out with people and you tell them you did a ritual earlier that day, odds are you’ll be met with the same response as if you told them you jerked off that morning.  What are rituals?  The truth is, that all of human life is made of rituals.  Mere mention of the word generally conjures images of occult symbols painted on the walls of decrepit basements, animal sacrifice, and strange chanting that reverberates off the walls of horror film scenery and news headlines to assault the American imagination. However, rituals are a universal feature of human cognitive function and social structure. It’s time we reevaluate what the meaning of a ritual is, and recognize the potential (dare I say) benefits of doing such things — specifically here the Destruction Ritual.  Rituals have a strange role in my life. Coming from an academic background in anthropology, the anthropological definition is engrained in my mind. The formal definition in that field is:  “Rituals are actions with intentional symbolic meaning undertaken for a specific cultural purpose, such as a rite of passage from childhood to adulthood, and may reinforce broader community social bonds, as in a wedding. They are used to reinforce social bonds and structure.”  Traditional Oriya Wedding Ceremony in India is a right-of-passage ritual practiced by those of the Hindu faith to ceremonialize the union between two people.  Communion is a Christian ritual in which bread and wine are consumed to symbolically represent the body and blood of Christ being consummated and taken into his worshippers.  New Year’s Eve ritual practiced by Americans in New York every year on January 31st at Midnight in which a giant ball is “dropped” from the top of Time Square and confetti is released to celebrate the arrival of another year.  I’m also a chapter head for The Satanic Temple, so writing and performing rituals has become a foundational and therapeutic practice for me. For the last few years, I’ve found myself straddling a line between scientific objectivism and emotional catharsis with the subject.  Rituals are repeated human actions to fulfill, reinforce and maintain a part of the human function and experience. Brushing our teeth is a ritual created to tend to our dental health. Breakfast, lunch and dinner are daily rituals to tend to our caloric intake. Prayer before bed, meals or at church every Sunday is a ritual to tend to piety and relationship with God. Going to the gym is a ritual to tend to maintenance of our muscular and cardiovascular systems. But why don’t gym bags, toothbrushes and Eggo waffles send people running for the hills?  The media-driven Manson case heavily polluted the concept of rituals in America.  The media has heavily slandered the practice of rituals. The taboo has gone so far in the U.S. as to compelling hundreds of police departments nationally to create specific manuals for identifying Satanic rituals and effectively “busting” anyone caught doing them. This has had devastating side effects on our society (see The Satanic Panic of the 1980s & 1990s). Countless people who simply didn’t fit the mold of their community have been falsely accused of and imprisoned for horrible crimes ranging from rape to murder.  What is The Satanic Temple?  The Satanic Temple is a religious and activist organization that was birthed from the idea that we are at a point in history where combating the status quo is an essential component of progression as individuals and as a society. In our view, Satan is a mascot for combating bigotry and detrimental authority. We see God and Satan as literary figures that have become so deeply engrained in our	0
    The cast of Vanderpump Rules has some choice words for their costar James Kennedy following his performance during the season 7 premiere of the Bravo hit.  “That’s pretty much what he does. That’s his MO. He needs to bring up things that happened years ago because there’s nothing for him to talk about,” Jax Taylor told Us Weekly exclusively when asked about James rapping about the former SUR bartender’s indiscretion with Faith Stowers in front of Jax’s fiancée, Brittany Cartwright, during the Monday, December 3, episode of Vanderpump Rules. “He doesn’t really have much going on in his life. There’s nothing there. There’s no substance to him. It gets to the point where it’s like, ‘What else do you got man?’ You’ve got nothing else anymore. We don’t really talk to him much anymore.”  Brittany, who accepted Jax’s proposal in the premiere, noted to Us that she has been “nothing but nice” to James, so he had no reason to embarrass her in front of her colleagues and the guests at SUR.  “I was crying and, like, ran out,” the Kentucky native explained. “He tries to say that that was about Jax, but Jax wasn’t there. I was the one that was there, I was the one that was embarrassed in front of the entire crowd, not Jax. So him trying to be like, ‘That was about Jax,’ that doesn’t make sense. That’s no ground to stand on because I was the one who got hurt that day.”  Even Lala Kent, who used to be the DJ’s only ally on the Bravo series, is no longer friends with James after he went after her close friends and fiancé Randall Emmett.  “I guess, fortunately, it hasn’t affected my life in a negative way, not being friends with him. So I’m good,” Lala told Us. “He has always been an extremely verbally abusive friend to me and I always shook it off because I knew that it was coming from a hurt place and I knew it really only happened when he was under the influence. But when you start attacking someone who I’m going to spend the rest of my life with, you might as well be attacking my mother as well.”  “It was just something that I couldn’t bounce back from,” she continued. “And now the people that I have in my world like Katie [Maloney], Kristen [Doute], Stassi [Schroeder], a friendship with James would never work because the people in my world don’t care for him. So I’ve moved on.”  Regarding the season premiere drama with James, Scheana Shay simply added, “Nothing with James surprises me.”  Vanderpump Rules airs on Bravo Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.

"But is he also Flynn Rider?  ""The Originals,"" vampire James Kent on ""True Blood,"" and Ethan Lovett on ""General Hospital"" -- will continue his fantasy heartthrob status on ""Once Upon a Time.""  According to Entertainment Weekly, the ABC show has cast Parsons in the recurring role of Nick, and he'll first arrive in ""Once"" Season 7, Episode 8, airing Friday, Nov. 17.    Nick is described as ""a confident and charismatic slacker-turned-successful-lawyer. He's polished, but not stuffy or smarmy. A natural guy's guy, Nick has an instant likability and always says the right thing.""    EW added that Nick is rumored to be playing the love interest of one of the other characters. So fans are obviously wondering which character. Some are also wondering if he might be the ""Once"" version of ""Tangled"" character Flynn Rider. Just because ... why not?  Earlier this week, it was revealed that ""Once"" is also adding ""Riverdale"" star Tiera Skovbye as Robin, grown-up daughter of Zelena and Robin Hood. She, too, is meant to play a love interest. Are the two castings related? She is said to be arriving in Episode 10, the winter finale, just a couple of episodes after Nick.  ""Once Upon a Time"" airs Fridays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.

For most of the history of television, the barrier to syndication—and to profitability—has been 100 episodes. The shows that have made it to that mark are an unusual group. Many were big hits. Some found small cult audiences. Still others just hung on as best they could and never posted numbers quite low enough to be canceled. In 100 Episodes, we examine the shows that made it to that number, considering both how they advanced and reflected the medium and what contributed to their popularity. This entry covers MTV’s The Challenge, which started in 1998 and completed its 26th season this year.  MTV’s long-running reality competition The Challenge has earned a reputation for stasis due to the frequency with which the same cohort of Bunim-Murray Productions alumni participates. For 17 years and 26 seasons, reality pioneer Bunim-Murray has been rounding up cast members from its Road Rules and The Real World franchises and pitting them against each other for cash and prizes, often with the same faces returning again and again. Although the lack of cast churn makes The Challenge seem static, the show has evolved more dramatically than any reality competition on the dial. Shows like Big Brother and Top Chef remain more or less identical to how they began. Meanwhile, The Challenge has changed its format, its host, and even its genre. It has gone from being an average, competent reality-adventure show to a heavily serialized, reality-based workplace drama.    Advertisement  The Challenge technically premiered in June 1998, but its earliest incarnation couldn’t be more different than what the show is now. The debut season didn’t even have the word “challenge” in its title. Road Rules: All Stars was Bunim-Murray’s first formal cross-pollination of its successful reality brands, and it grew out of a playful franchise rivalry in which each season’s Road Rules gang would try to prank the Real World cast currently in production. All Stars followed Road Rules’ standard format except that instead of a group of collegiate unknowns, an assorted quintet of former Real World housemates teamed up for an action-packed road trip with the promise of a “handsome reward” awaiting them at the final destination. All Stars had no eliminations, duels, or cash prizes, and the primary draw was watching Real World’s spoiled homebodies in more taxing, goal-focused scenarios. The show didn’t feature bone-crushing physical challenges, and was instead fueled by Amazing Race-style travel excursions such as sheep shearing and spending the night in a purportedly haunted mental hospital.  The Road Rules facsimile format remained intact until the fifth season, 2002’s Real World/Road Rules Challenge: Battle Of The Seasons, in which the producers eliminated the Winnebago trips and began housing the cast in swanky, isolated villas. The new format inverted the show’s original concept; rather than expose the coddled Real World housemates to a relatively harsh life on the road, the Road Rules cast members were granted a taste of the tony Real World lifestyle. The change was all the more significant because of when it took place—as Bunim-Murray was in production on Real World: Las Vegas, the season in which that show completed its transformation from an earnest examination of difference to a boozy bacchanal. The massive success of the Las Vegas season, which embodied the city’s den-of-iniquity image, affirmed The Real World’s tonal shift. And as The Challenge started to resemble The Real World, it naturally developed its forebear’s appetite for hook-ups, blow-ups, and drunken debauchery.    By Battle Of The Seasons, The Challenge had gone from a friendly rivalry to a fierce competition after three seasons as a six-on-six face-off between teams representing Road Rules and Real World, a face-off Road Rules almost always won. Battle Of The Seasons kept the franchise rivalry component, but the cast was expanded considerably, up from 12 contestants to 32, each of them paired up wi	1

"The reality of Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez's break becoming a permanent breakup may be sinking in for the Biebs, or so People's new report suggests. A source close to Bieber told the outlet that despite all the Baskin Champion romance talk, Justin Bieber just wants to have Gomez back with him—at church, the ice rink, and beyond. “He loves her. He wants her back,” the source said, adding that Bieber “misses” Gomez.  Bieber and Gomez's last big public date was his father's wedding in Jamaica, where they recreated their 2011 wedding kiss. They spent 6 out of 7 consecutive days together that week, indicating they were stronger than ever and might make their on-off relationship permanently on this time, according to the tabloids.  But Gomez's family never approved of the Biebs, a major factor that led to their break, some outlets reported. And Bieber, according to Us Weekly's source, started acting selfish again, annoying Gomez. “[He] doesn’t care about anyone but himself,"" the source told Us on March 12. ""The second she saw it, she walked away, especially now with her health. She knows she doesn’t need him.”  The break seemed to be instigated by Gomez right around Bieber's March 1 birthday. Bieber never wanted this: ""Justin has been upset about the recent break from Selena and is trying to keep busy until they work things out,"" a source told E! on March 21. ""It wasn't his choice for them to split, and he is really taking time to focus on himself right now.""  Meanwhile, Gomez had a realization, E! reported on March 26: that he may be better, but they may still not be right... at least right now. ""Selena realized even though he's made some positive improvements, they just aren't a perfect match right now,"" a source told the outlet.  But Gomez's birthday post to Bieber remains on her Instagram, a sign that hope may not be lost yet.  Gomez was most recently photographed with her friends yesterday, posing in pink pajamas and Puma merch. She was also filmed lipsyncing in the car by her assistant Theresa Mingus:  Instagram  Bieber attended Holy Wednesday church service with Baskin Champion but has not been photographed with her since. His last appearance was on his social media on Easter, when he posted four bunny selfies."	0

"Some two months after American Horror Story: Cult wrapped up last November, FX announced that season eight was a go. Here, everything we know so far about Apocalypse:  1. It began shooting in the summer. In April, showrunner Ryan Murphy said that shooting would commence in mid-June. Also in June, FX confirmed that the new season would premiere Sept. 12.  2. It is not called Radioactive, but Apocalypse. The past few seasons of AHS have stayed relatively mysterious until they premiered, and season eight is so far no different. Though internet sleuths discovered that a trademark was filed for American Horror Story: Radioactive and became convinced that the new season would be named as such, in July, FX announced that season eight is officially called Apocalypse.  3. It's set in the future, technically. While some rumors place the setting of the new season in 2032, Murphy said in April that it would be set ""18 months from today,"" so in October 2019. ""It’s still topical, but [set in] the future, which I’ve never done,"" he said. ""I think people will like it. It’s different from what we’ve done before."" Theorists have noted that Oct. 6, 2019 marks the 58th anniversary of a speech by JFK telling Americans to build nuclear bomb shelters, which would track with the alleged ""radioactive"" theme. Murphy has also said that it will be more fantasy-based than the show's previous two seasons. ""It’s heightened,"" he said in April. ""It’s not necessarily as real and grounded as the past season. We’re sort of getting back to Asylum, and Coven. That’s the tone of it.""    4. Kathy Bates will be back. After star turns in Coven, Freak Show, Hotel, and Roanoke, Bates had to sit out Cult due to her commitment to her Netflix show Disjointed, but Murphy has confirmed that she'll be back for season eight and that she's one of the leads. I hope she gets to yell ""LIIIIIIIES"" again.  FX  5. MVPs Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters will also be back. Paulson and Peters have lead roles, per Murphy, and Peters will be a hairstylist. Cheyenne Jackson, Adina Porter, Billy Eichner, Leslie Grossman, and Emma Roberts will be back too.  6. Dame. Joan. Collins. Murphy confirmed in April that the iconic Dynasty actress will join the cast in season eight, though of course has not given hints as to what she'll be doing besides being Evan Peters's grandmother. Does it even matter, though? She's Joan Collins.  Joan Collins in 2018. Getty Images  7. It's the Coven/Murder House crossover season. In June, Ryan tweeted that the next season of AHS would be the promised mashup of seasons one and three. Also of note: Connie Britton is no longer attached to 9-1-1, which means she could be free to return as her Murder House character Vivien Harmon (who died, but this show loves ghosts, so that doesn't really matter).    On Aug. 26, Britton and Dylan McDermott confirmed their return as their Murder House husband-and-wife duo, Vivien and Ben. According to the Instagram caption from Britton's set photo, Sarah Paulson will direct at least one episode this season.  8. Remember the Harmon baby? He’s all grown up — and he’s back. In July, Murphy announced that Cody Fern will reprise his role as Michael Langdon in Apocalypse.    Viewers first met Michael at the end of Murder House, when Vivien gave birth to a child fathered by a ghost. Does that mean this season is about the apocalypse brought on by that devil baby? Is the devil baby in the promo image supposed to be Michael? And what’s he been doing this whole time? I don’t know, but I’ll tell you what: I love devil babies.  9. Jessica Lange is coming back. Lange hasn't appeared on the show since season four, Freak Show, so if you've been missing Constance Langdon, Fiona Goode, Sister Jude, or Elsa Mars, then you're in luck. During a TCA event in August, Paulson said that Lange would return as Constance.  On Sept. 19, Murphy shared the first set photo of Lange returning as Queen Constance. Bow down.  10a.

Hollywood’s elite turned out Thursday night at the Dolby Theatre, home of the Oscars, to pay tribute to George Clooney, this year’s American Film Institute Life Achievement Award recipient. Faces in the crowd included Netflix’s Ted Sarandos, CBS’ Leslie Moonves and Paramount’s Jim Gianopulos, just to name a few.  Diane Keaton, last year’s AFI honoree, took the stage early to marvel at Clooney’s distant relationship with former president Abraham Lincoln and rib him over that “Killer Tomatoes” sequel he’s never quite lived down. Laura Dern remembered cutting her teeth with Clooney in failed horror project “Grizzly II: The Concert.” Jimmy Kimmel, returning to the Dolby stage for the first time since the 90th annual Academy Awards in March, regaled with stories of “rascal” Clooney’s infamous practical jokes, which have apparently included sending packages to Brad Pitt labeled “the porn that you ordered.”  “Friends” stars Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox went ahead and took credit for Clooney’s rise thanks to their hit NBC show being the lead-in for “ER” all those years ago. “Without us you’re ‘Chicago Hope,’ buddy,” Cox quipped. Meanwhile a teary-eyed Julianna Margulies told the story of her “ER” character’s original fate in the pilot (she was to die of a drug overdose), and how Clooney went to bat for her to stick around with a recurring role. Clooney — his wife Amal by his side, the pair flanked by actor Bill Murray and Clooney’s father Nick — was visibly touched by her comments.  Popular on Variety  In video packages filmed at Cinecitta Studios in Rome, where Clooney is in pre-production on his upcoming “Catch-22” adaptation, the Oscar-winning multi-hyphenate recalled how his cousin, the late actor Miguel Ferrer, coaxed Clooney out to the west coast for a stab at acting. Clooney also commended “From Dusk Till Dawn” director Robert Rodriguez for giving him a real break in movies and noted the wake-up call of 1997 superhero stinker “Batman & Robin,” which made him realize he needed to focus as much on the creative aspects of his projects as on his own work in front of the camera.  The clip that drew the biggest burst of applause from those gathered in the ballroom and the mezzanine above was Joel and Ethan Coen’s “O Brother, Where Art Thou?” “I’ve played four idiots for them,” Clooney said of his work with the sibling filmmakers. “They saw in me the brilliance of my idiocy.” Miley Cyrus even stopped by with a back-up band wielding fiddles and banjos for a rendition of the film’s hit arrangement of “Man of Constant Sorrow.”  Clooney’s ties to journalism (via his father’s newsroom background) and commitment to philanthropy through aid to Darfur, Haiti and post-Katrina New Orleans, among other causes, became something of a recurring theme. AFI trustee Howard Stringer even evoked Clooney’s 2005 Oscar-nominated biopic “Good Night, and Good Luck,” which centered on pioneering newsman Edward R. Murrow. Calling the drama “eerily prophetic,” Stringer deemed it a movie that “should be required for modern journalists, as well as modern politicians.”  Don Cheadle recalled something Clooney once told him about having a platform such as he does: “If they’re going to put the cameras on me, then I’m going to take them to where the cameras should be.” Clooney, meanwhile, spoke in the pre-taped material about his affinity for reluctant heroes and characters who stood up against the system in films like “To Kill a Mockingbird,” “High Noon,” “Three Days of the Condor” and “The Verdict.”  “We learned to question things from my father,” the night’s honoree said of the elder Clooney, who offered his own toast near the end of the evening that brought his son close to tears.  And for the first time publicly, Amal Clooney also spoke about her husband. “Coming here I knew there would be lots of people who could speak to George’s talent,” she said. “So I thought I should say a few words about his character. He is a gentleman in every sense of the word and	1
"Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Why Meghan Markle was written out of Suits  The creator of Suits has said the decision was taken to write Meghan Markle's character out of the TV series as long as a year ago.  Aaron Korsh told Radio 4's Today programme he ""took a gamble"" on Ms Markle's relationship with Prince Harry working out.  Ms Markle plays lawyer Rachel Zane in the American legal drama.  She confirmed this week that she would leave the show after announcing her engagement to the prince.  'Two people in love'  In the interview, Korsh said: ""I knew from a year ago that this relationship was burgeoning.  ""And I had a decision to make because I didn't want to intrude and ask her, 'hey what's going on and what are you going to do?'.  ""So collectively with the writers, we decided to take a gamble that these two people were in love and it was going to work out.""  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Aaron Korsh says he anticipated Meghan Markle's departure from Suits  Korsh added: ""What we decided to do (was to) say, 'look, I would rather have good things happen to Meghan in her life' - which would likely mean her leaving the show.  ""So let's plan on that and it's much easier to undo that, if it came to it, than to just plan on her staying forever and then finding out she's going to go.  ""And the only way to write a character out like that would be if they got hit by a bus or something.""  Ms Markle has played the paralegal turned lawyer since the first series of Suits in 2011.  The current series will be her last and - in instance of art imitating life - will show her character marrying boyfriend Mike Ross, played by Patrick J Adams.  After hearing news of the engagement, Adams joked on Twitter he thought his on-screen partner had just popped out for milk.  He later posted a glowing tribute to Ms Markle, telling Prince Harry: ""Your Royal Highness, you are a lucky man and I know your long life together will be joyful, productive and hilarious. Meghan, so happy for you, friend. Much love.""  The royal wedding will take place at Windsor Castle in May.  Asked how he thought Ms Markle would deal with the pressure of royal life, Korsh said: ""She is just a natural in front of the camera, and her intelligence and poise... I mean if anyone could handle it I'd say it was Meghan.""  On the couple's engagement, he added that ""the whole thing is like a fairytale"" describing it as ""like a dream come true"".

    No white flag here. Sheree Whitfield tells Us Weekly that she doesn’t see her Real Housewives of Atlanta costars forgiving Phaedra Parks anytime soon after that bombshell reunion finale last week.  “My heart dropped so far,” Whitfield recalled of the explosive moment when host Andy Cohen called out Parks for spreading the “megawatt lie” that fellow castmate Kandi Burruss and her husband, Todd Tucker, were planning to drug and take home Porsha Williams. “I was in shock! We were all in shock.”  When asked if she thinks Parks will be forgiven, Whitfield, who is currently on her Wives, Fiancées, and Side-Chicks of Hotlanta book tour, told Us she doesn’t see them mending things in the near future.  “I don’t know, it’s so hard right now. It’s hard to establish trust with someone like that because, for me, it seemed that she showed no remorse for what she did and for her actions,” Whitfield explained. “I think it will be hard for any of the women to forgive.”  As for Parks’ exit from the series — Us Weekly previously confirmed she’s out for season 10 — Whitfield is uncertain how she feels.  “I never want to take money out of anyone’s pockets and that’s not who I am, but in this instance, it’s hard to say,” the reality star concluded.	1

The One Direction heartthrob from Holmes Chapel has had audiences shook with his acting talents in the war drama, with fans and new admirers keen to see his return to the big screen following a “remarkable” debut.  Who would have thought the formerly floppy-haired Styles , who as a teenager had a Saturday job working in a bakery, would head onto the silver screen after X Factor boyband 1D announced their hiatus in 2015?  Dunkirk director Christopher Nolan has compared Styles landing the part in his World War Two epic to choosing the late Heath Ledger as the Joker The Dark Knight - and Ledger went on to win the posthumous Oscar for best supporting actor for his role in the Batman blockbuster.  One fan said: “Petition to have Harry Styles to star in the next big rom-com.” Another tweeted: “Calling all hollywood directors: give me a romantic comedy with Harry Styles.”  (Image: Evan Agostini/Invision/AP)  And @TerrelleGraham praised: “Got to give props to Harry Styles. He is great in #Dunkirk. Would like to see him tackle some more serious roles in the future.”  Speaking with Radio One presenter Nick Grimshaw, the former Holmes Chapel Comprehensive School pupil joked that for Dunkirk he used his experience playing Buzz Lightyear in a school production.  And this was was the only previous acting experience he had to draw on to play Alex, a junior soldier desperately trying to get home as enemy forces close in on the beaches.  Also starring in Dunkirk, about the 1940 evacuation of Allied troops from the French shores, are acting heavyweights Tom Hardy, Mark Rylance, Kenneth Branagh and Cillian Murphy. And the charismatic Styles more than earns his place at the table, to the extent audiences could easily forget they were watching a popstar up their on the cinema screen.  One film-goer tweeted after a trip to the cinema: “Anyone realized how Alex from Dunkirk looks exactly like Harry Styles?”  ‘Kingsley’ said: “Last 5 mins of #Dunkirk my friend leans over to me and goes “Is that Harry Styles?”  And Daniel Reji commented: “Harry Styles had a remarkable debut as an actor in Dunkirk.”  In September Styles will kick off his sold-out world tour after his single Sign of the Times and and self-titled album were released to acclaim with comparisons drawn with Freddy Mercury and David Bowie’s Ziggy Stardust alter-ego. And he can now add ‘movie star’ to his CV.  Here are other popstars who have made the switch to big screen:  Beyoncé  (Image: Kevin Winter/WireImage)  Queen Bey makes movies for her own albums these days.  But the Work It Out singer had a turn in Austin Powers: Goldmember, which divided the critics, and she shone as Deena in the 2006 film Dreamgirls based on the story of the Supremes which saw Jennifer Hudson and Eddie Murphy win best supporting actress and actor gongs at the Oscars.  Michael Jackson  (Image: AP Photo/Joerg Sarbach)  The King of Pop made a werewolf movie within a zombie film as the epic video for the 80s monster hit Thriller.  And he packed devoted fans into cinemas for Moonwalker, which was a collection of short films about Jackson’s life as well an adventure film starring MJ.  In 1978 he had a starring role as The Scarecrow in The Wiz, a remake of one of his favourite films The Wizard of Oz co-starring Diana Ross as Dorothy.  Justin Timberlake  (Image: Invision)  JT’s albums are pop and R&B perfection. But we have to wait while he heads off to make huge Hollywood films in between making music.  Like Styles, Timberlake is a former boyband member with N’Sync and he has gone on to carve out a hugely successful career as a solo singer and as an actor.

‘Tensions have been rising between Jen and Portia for a while now, and things definitely came to a head during their meal,’ spills the insider.  ‘Everything started off great at the start of the night, but it wasn’t long before things became very heated between Jen and Portia.’  According to the source, Jen and Ellen spent a long time away from the table engrossed in a conversation, and Portia clearly began to get suspicious.  ‘Jen and Ellen had been talking away from the group for a while and Portia didn’t like it.  After a while Portia confronted Jen and accused her of being a bad influence on Ellen, and it just took off from there.  Jen is always going to stick up for herself – especially when she’s not doing anything wrong – and things got pretty tense.  ‘Everyone was talking about it. It was a pretty dramatic end to the night and Portia seemed pretty angry,’ the source adds.  Since Jen’s recent split from Justin, 46, in February, along with rumoured troubles with Jen’s ex-husband Brad Pitt, 54, Portia knows that Jen isn’t very positive about relationships at the moment and she doesn’t feel comfortable with Jen hanging around with Ellen.  ‘At the end of the day, Portia just doesn’t trust Jen around Ellen. She is convinced that Jen is turning Ellen against her.  ‘They’ve never seen eye to eye and Portia is convinced that Jen badmouths her to Ellen, and it drives her wild with anger and jealousy,’ the source adds.  Reports that Portia’s nine-year marriage to Ellen is in trouble have surfaced repeatedly, with Life & Style claiming the couple were fighting non-stop last year.  One Craig’s staffer admitted to the publication that the couple didn’t seem happy at all while they were dining at the eatery.  ‘Ellen seemed miserable and Portia just looked sad,’ the staffer said. ‘“Happy” isn’t the first word I would use to describe them,’ they added.  And according to New Idea’s source, Portia is concerned that Ellen is saying negative things about her to Jen, and the Friends actress is just adding fuel to the fire, especially as she’s had such a bad run in her own love life.  ‘Portia knows that Ellen talks to Jen about her and their marriage – especially their relationship troubles – and she can only imagine what Jen has to say about that,’ the source says.  Portia’s biggest fear is that Jen will advise Ellen to simply throw in the towel – like she did with Justin – and give her the wrong message.  ‘The fact that Jen is pretty down on love and negative about marriage at the moment, after her relationship to Justin ended so abruptly, makes it worse in Portia’s eyes. She and Ellen have ups and downs like any married couple, but she’s worried that Jen has given up on marriage and is telling Ellen to do the same.’  But despite troubles behind closed doors, Portia and Ellen remain publicly united.  ‘We’re just really good friends and we talk about everything, and we never, ever, ever lie to each other, like, not even the tiniest lies,’ Portia told ET. ‘And she’s the only person I want to hang out with. Like, she is my best friend and I just want to be with her all the time.’  For the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!	0
"Fifty Shades Freed wastes zero time—the final installment of the films based on E.L. James' (dominant) boy meets (virginal) girl story dives right in to the nuptials of Christian Grey (played by Jamie Dornan) and Anastasia Steele (Dakota Johnson). When we meet Ana this time around, she's wearing her wedding dress: a lace-and-tulle confection that cascades to the ground in an elegant train.  The woman responsible for the memorable dress is Monique Lhuillier, who also designed the silver slip dress Ana wore to the masquerade ball in the second film, Fifty Shades Darker. We talked to Lhuillier over the phone about whether we can get our hands on Ana's dress (yes), how long it takes to make (a really long time), and what underwear one wears under such a body-skimming garment (thongs!).  Universal Pictures  What was your starting point with the wedding dress?  I wanted to make sure it was iconic and very memorable, because once it's in a film it lives forever. So I wanted to create something traditional but with a modern twist, and really make sure it encompassed Anastasia's personality. I also wanted it to have the aesthetic of my collections, knowing the reason they came to me was showcasing my design aesthetic through the character.  How much attention do you pay to current trends when you are designing for a film?  I was fortunate to be given freedom with this dress—[apart from basic details like] she's getting married in the scene, she likes long sleeves. But they were open to any ideas. So I sketched three options and chose fabrics and presented it to them—they came back with the selection and that's how we ultimately landed on that dress.  Will people be able to buy this dress?  Yes, eventually. Right now it doesn't exist in the collection, but it 's something that we're open to once there's a demand for it.  Universal  How long did it take to make?  It was quite a short turnaround—I would say from concept to the actual dress, maybe three months. The reason being that we had just finished the last details for the grey/silver dress, and they said, We'd love for you to do the wedding dress. So as I was finishing one, that was when the other task came. They filmed the movies back to back, so I had more time with the first dress than I did with the wedding dress.  How stressful!  But the thing is, that's what I do best. I have a factory here in Los Angeles, and we do everything from scratch here in-house. That's the beauty of it, I can make things quickly.  How long would it usually take to have a custom Monique Lhuillier dress made?  If you walked into my store and ordered something off the rack, it takes us six months to do that. When I work one-on-one with a client and design a custom dress from sketch to final fittings, we ask for 11 months.  Dakota Johnson (as Ana) wears Monique Lhuillier in Fifty Shades Darker Universal Pictures  Dakota Johnson said that she had some fittings for the dress. How did that go? Did she have any input?  Even going back to the first dress, it was an open dialog the entire time. We'd say, ""Let's raise the neckline a little bit for the grey dress, because [Ana] is more demure. We didn't want it to be too sexy. So we customized each look and each feeling at the beginning and tweak it as we went along.  The point of view for the [Darker] dress was a man selecting the dress for her, so it was more sleek and modern. We added the cape because we wanted more drama and movement when she walked into the masquerade ball. The wedding dress was more from her point of view—selecting the dress of her dreams, reflecting what her personal style is, so we did less tweaking to that. Once the design was selected, we were just perfecting the fit. The design didn't change because it was clear from the start what we wanted to do.  What's the connection between your own collections and this wedding dress?  My dresses are always very feminine, elegant, modern. They're also traditional with a modern twist. Fabrications c"	1

"Premiere of HBO Films' 'Confirmation' at Paramount Theater - Arrivals Featuring: Rose McGowan Where: Hollywood, California, United States When: 31 Mar 2016 Credit: FayesVision/WENN.com  Rose McGowan united with her fellow Harvey Weinstein accusers Asia Argento and Annabella Sciorra for a powerful meeting of minds.    Argento shared a photo of the get-together on Twitter on Saturday, and she praised the women for their strength in coming forward with their allegations of the disgraced film mogul's sexual misconduct.  ""You are my sister and I love you,” Argento captioned a snap of her and McGowan together. “May all your dreams come true. I want this for you. They’re gonna come true @AnnabellSciorra and @Rosemcgowan.""  The former ""Charmed"" actress shared the same photo on Instagram, writing: “Magical moments with @asiaargento & @iamannabellasciorra #WomenRise #Survivors #ROSEARMY.”  TV presenter and chef Anthony Bourdain - who is currently dating Argento - was also present for the meeting and wrote on Twitter that “it was an honor to cook for this meeting of the minds.”  And when a fan asked what he had cooked for the women, Argento swiftly replied: ""He cooked us food filled with love and strength.""  The 42-year-old Italian actress has accused Weinstein of forcibly performing oral sex on her during the late ‘90s. Argento said she was “terrified” of Weinstein, adding, “It wouldn’t stop. It was a nightmare.”    Sciorra alleged Weinstein had raped her and then claimed he tried to perform oral sex on her, while McGowan has also accused the disgraced movie producer of rape.  Weinstein is under investigation by police in New York, Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, and the U.K. for sexual assault accusations made against him. He has denied all claims of non-consensual sex.  McGowan's meet-up with the women comes as Los Angeles Police Chief Charlie Beck told the Los Angeles Times that he expects more high profile sexual misconduct cases to come to light.  In an email to the newspaper, he said: “We anticipate the LAPD (Los Angeles Police Department) and other jurisdictions will receive even more high profile sex crime reports in the coming weeks and months. We encourage all victims of sexual assault to come forward to report these crimes.""  According to the Los Angeles Times, the LAPD has 28 open investigations related to media figures, including Harvey Weinstein and Gossip Girl star Ed Westwick, who has been accused by multiple women of sexual assault and rape."	1
"""I want to have it all,” Jennifer Aniston declared in 2006 about juggling a career and a family. “The women that inspire me are the ones who have careers and children; why would I want to limit myself? I’ve never in my life said I didn’t want to have children. I did and I do and I will!” Well, here we are over a decade later, and Jen is ready to make that happen... with Brad Pitt!  “The two have grown closer over the last couple of years,” a friend told In Touch exclusively. “His marriage [to Angelina Jolie] fell apart, then her marriage to Justin [Theroux] ended. During that difficult time, Brad and Jen reconnected. It’s like destiny brought them together, and I can definitely see them having a child together.”  Of course, Brad is already a father of six, and admitted that “Being a father has changed me on so many levels and made me more generous and alive.” Jen is 49 and has never had children, so Brad could surely help her through it. “He and Jen have talked about moving in together and giving this another try,” says the insider. “This could all lead to her finally having his baby.” Brad “has babies on the brain,” adds the insider. “Brad loves being a dad. It’s a huge part of who he is.”  Because of Jen’s age, the chances of conceiving naturally are extremely slim, “But they would try,” says her pal. If that doesn’t work, they would move on to IVF, adds the friend, “Even if it meant months of trying IVF. When Jen sets her mind to something, she doesn’t stop until she succeeds.” After their long and heartbreaking journey away from and now back to each other, “It’s the blockbuster news that friends, family and fans have been hoping for.”  Of course, the idea infuriates Angie. “It’s the ultimate slap in the face,” said an insider. But they won’t let Angelina stop them, “I think the more they talk about starting a family, the more it makes sense.” (A rep for Jen denied the story, while a rep for Brad had no comment.) “They both have changed over the years and, after much heartache, are at a great place in their lives,” says the insider. “Brad loves the idea of how they’d both come full circle and found each other again. Having a child together seems like the perfect next step.”  They're different people now, and could give them the chance to right some wrongs. “One of Jen’s greatest regrets is that they never had a baby together when they were married,” says the friend. “Jen and Brad tried midway through their marriage, but she lost the baby and they were heartbroken. She’s been wanting a baby ever since, but it just hasn’t come together for her.”  Jen has decided to sell her $25 million Bel Air mansion (which recently was featured on the cover of Architectural Digest) and plans to move into Brad’s Pacific Palisades home so they can be under one roof. “Jen and Brad are seizing the now-or-never moment. They’re ready.”  Read more about Jen and Brad's baby plans in this week's issue of In Touch Weekly, on newsstands now!

"Earlier this year, 22 people died after someone detonated a bomb at an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England. While the attack may have prevented other musicians from performing live for a good amount of time — and understandably so — Ariana came back as resilient as ever, ultimately headlining a benefit concert for those affected by the attack and continuing the entirety of her tour with limited interruption. And she did it with continuing grace, no less.  While Ari has spoken sparingly about her Manchester experience in the past — mostly at that aforementioned benefit concert — she opened up in a new interview with Coveteur on how abandoning her ""Dangerous Woman"" tour was never, ever an option in the midst of everything going on.  “I don’t think I’ve been through anything as traumatic as [what] we’ve been through. So . . . [the tour] can be a lot,"" she explained. ""Calling it off and going home was not an option. The message of the show was too important. For the crew and everyone involved, it’s become more than just a show for us. We are really grateful to be here and really grateful for this show.""  While Ari acknowledges she's now going to take much-deserved time off to ""check in"" on her health, her unifying message of love is what powered her through the most trying of times this year. “I think the most important thing is to have each other’s backs. When you see something or hear something that’s upsetting, or someone says something that’s upsetting, even if it’s not to you, just say something and be there and support each other,"" she explained. ""Misogyny is ever-present, and we have to be there to support one another. That’s really it. It’s about the sisterhood. There’s no competing in that. We have to lift each other up, not try and claw each other down.""  Spoken like a true honorary citizen of Manchester.

"""Playboy"" founder Hugh Hefner died Wednesday at age 91. The media mogul created a multimillion-dollar empire focused on an affluent, sexually liberated lifestyle. Hefner was working as a cartoonist for Esquire magazine in 1952. When he was turned down for a $5 raise, he quit his job at the publication and ventured out on his own. In 1953, Hefner founded Playboy magazine using $600 of his own money and several thousand more he borrowed, including $1,000 from his devoutly religious mother. She wrote the check after her husband had said no — ""not because she believed in the venture,"" Hefner told E! in 2006, ""but because she believed in her son."" That loan made her a millionaire.

"Kim Richards has been going strong on the road to recovery as she maintains her sobriety. The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills pal has started volunteering at Skydog Ranch, a nonprofit organization that provides a forever home to wild mustangs that have found themselves at kill pens, at auctions, or abusive and neglectful homes. Skydog Ranch provides volunteer opportunities to people in recovery.  Kim recently told E! News that working at Skydog Ranch has helped with the recovery process over the past year-and-a-half. ""My recovery has been amazing and I love how I feel. This has been a huge part of it and has helped me a lot,"" she explained. ""The Sanctuary keeps me grounded and keeps me at peace and it's healthy for me. It's been amazing for me and me coming here has really been a major part of keeping me sober.""  The RHOBH sister shared that her work at the Sanctuary has helped her get back what she's lost about herself. ""I do, you can't not find yourself here with the horses and the animals. There is something about it and it gives me self-confidence and self-worth because sometimes people lose themselves and coming here gives me that self-confidence and self-worth that for a long time I thought I lost,"" she said in regards to whether she feels like she's found herself.

Selena Gomez and The Weeknd have reportedly split after 10 months together. And, they’ve allegedly been on the rocks for a while. The breakup report comes just one day after she and her ex Justin Bieber spent all of Sunday together!  Selena Gomez, 25, and The Weeknd, 27, have split, multiple sources confirm to PEOPLE. “She and Abel have been going back and forth for a few months about their relationship,” an insider tells the mag. “It’s been hard with him being on tour and her shooting in New York. That wasn’t easy on them.” Although Selena “always made an effort” to attend his shows around her busy schedule, “that played a part in them getting distant,” the source adds. “It’s over for now, but they’re still in touch.”  The reported split has been tough on the couple, according to the mag. “It’s been hard for them to come to the realization that this is the direction things were heading, but it’s been hard for months,” the insider says, who adds that Selena is not back with her ex, Justin Bieber, 23. Selena and The Weeknd began dating in Jan. 2017, after they were photographed on a dinner date in Santa Monica, CA.  Although Sel and The Weeknd seemed picture perfect, some fans had their doubts when news broke that she’s been hanging out with her ex, Bieber. It was almost as if the internet broke on Oct. 24, when Jelena reunited, and were then spotted together on multiple occasions. On Oct. 22, photos surfaced of Justin arriving at Selena’s CA home; she was pictured arriving home just minutes after. The exes reportedly spent hours inside her home with mutual friends. And, Just reportedly didn’t leave until the next morning.  Then, on Oct. 29, Jelena were photographed once again; this time in the same frame. The pair grabbed breakfast at JOi Cafe in Westlake Village, CA, a suburb northwest of Los Angeles. Then, Sel and Justin attended a church service together at Zoe Church in LA, where an onlooker caught them sitting together in the front row.  After their day out together, Jelena ended up back at Justin’s crib later that night. The on-again-off-again exes were photographed looking pretty cozy together inside his CA mansion.  As you may know, the years-long saga of Jelena began in 2009, when Justin asked his manager to reach out to Sel’s. He had an adorable crush on Sel before they began dating. And, the rest if pretty much history, with a ton of sweet and dramatic moments in between. The pair called it quits [or so we thought] for good, around early 2016. But, it looks like true love always finds its way.  HollywoodLifers, do you want to see Jelena back together?	0
"Khloe Kardashian had a lot of help from her own mom when it came to decorating her baby's nursery.  Khloe confirmed her pregnancy via a baby bump photo on Instagram in December and revealed on Keeping Up With the Kardashians earlier this year that she and Tristan Thompson are expecting a baby girl. E! News learned on Thursday she gave birth to their daughter. The news comes amid an alleged cheating scandal involving Tristan. The two have not commented.  Khloe's mother Kris Jenner has helped her a lot with her nursery, flying to Cleveland to lend a hand in person and also shipping decor and other baby products to the house, E! News has learned.  In early March, the two spent two hours shopping for baby gear, toys, furniture and clothes at Petit Tresor and Couture Kids in Los Angeles. Khloe picked out items in pink and neutral colors. Kris made many suggestions and Khloe agreed with many of them, a source told E! News. Kris paid for everything and was happy to treat Khloe, who thanked her several times, the source said.  ""Kris and Khloe were having a blast inside Petit Tresor together,"" another insider told E! News at the time. ""They were both laughing and having fun picking out all of the different baby items. Kris knew exactly what Khloe needed and was helping make a lot of the decisions. The majority of the store is filled with girl items and most items are neutral or pink colored. There are not many boy options, so they had a lot to choose from for her little girl.""  ""They bought a hefty amount and had a lot delivered to a house in Calabasas,"" the insider said. ""Khloe also registered several items on a registry and sent it out to her guests for her shower. The registry is already almost completely sold out. It's been nuts.""  ""Been decorating the baby nursery all day! We are so close!"" Khloe tweeted on March 14. ""I'm getting more and more anxious and excited with everyday."""	0
Emily Ratajkowski was asked about her boobs in an article published Thursday in Marie Claire, and she didn’t hold back.  “Boobs are funny. They hurt sometimes, and sometimes they’re the thing that makes me feel the most powerful,” the 26-year-old Sports Illustrated Swimsuit model explained. “They’re a key to my sexuality.”  A post shared by Emily Ratajkowski (@emrata) on May 10, 2018 at 2:44pm PDT  “They’re all those things,” she added. “I remember there was some article like ‘Emily Ratajkowski Is the Mozart of Breasts.’ What was so bad is someone sent it to my dad, who sent it to me. My dad still sees me as a little kid. I love my boobs. I love other people’s boobs. Boobs are kind of great.”  A post shared by Emily Ratajkowski (@emrata) on Jul 26, 2017 at 9:46am PDT  The swimsuit beauty also shared that she is not messing around when it comes to getting Hollywood to take her seriously.  A post shared by Emily Ratajkowski (@emrata) on Mar 2, 2018 at 6:32pm PST  “It’s actually something I’ve thought about a lot without ever saying seriousness in my head,” the model shared. “I care a lot. I think I freak people out sometimes going into meeting with Hollywood producers … with f*cking guns blazing. I had something to prove, and it had very little to do with my acting ability or the way I looked. It was about the ‘Take me seriously. Look me in the eye.'”  The comments come after she made headlines last year when people thought the model said that her big boobs had kept her from getting jobs in the fashion and entertainment industry. She later clarified her statement that the comment was about the fashion industry, not Hollywood.	1

"They're colorful, bombastic, fabulous and the ultimate statement pieces -- they're fascinators, and you're about to see them gracing many of the heads of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding attendees.  Interested in Royal Family? Add Royal Family as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Royal Family news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest  What is a fascinator?  Typically, women attending a British wedding wear a hat, or a ""fascinator,"" to accessorize their outfit. Usually, the fascinator is worn during the ceremony and the reception, but will often be taken off in the evening or during dinner.  A fascinator may seem ostentatious to those who aren't used to the style, but they are staples in a Brit's wardrobe.  UK Press via Getty Images  ""Originally, fascinators were smaller, with little decorations,"" Suzanne Cotton, the fashion design chair at Columbus College of Art and Design, told ""Good Morning America."" ""But in the William and Kate years, fascinators became an over-the-top accessory. I definitely think they’ve evolved from being a small, pretty thing like a little piece of netting with a flower to being these very over-the-top fashion statements.""  Fascinators can come in all shapes and sizes, but they do have certain parameters.  A fascinator is a decorative hat that is typically large and attached to a headband, small combs or an elastic back.  ""They’re attached to headbands, they’re easy to wear, and they still allow you to make a bold fashion statement,"" Cotton said.  How did the fascinator get its name?  The word “fascinator” may trace its roots back to the Latin word ""fascinatus,"" which means to bewitch, according to Cotton.  ""And I think fascinators can certainly do that,"" Cotton said. ""They give people a chance to make a bold fashion statement.""  When did fascinators come onto the fashion scene?  Fascinators have been used for hundreds of years, according to fashion experts, but Cotton contends they've been through quite an evolution since their advent.  ""In the 19th and 20th centuries, fascinators were light knitted headpieces, but the modern fascinator ... really became popular in the 1980s and ’90s,"" Cotton said.  UK Press via Getty Images  Sandra Walcott, an adjunct assistant professor for the Fashion Institute of Technology's Accessories Design Department, told ""GMA"" the fascinator became popular after milliners Stephen Jones and Philip Treacy created some creative pieces for London celebrities.  Jones had Diana, Princess of Wales, as a consistent client due to his avant-garde designs in the early 1980s.  Treacy is a favorite of many international celebrities, such as Sarah Jessica Parker and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. Of the various transfixing fascinators worn to Prince William and Kate Middleton's 2011 wedding, 36 of them were Treacy's.  Most notably, Princess Beatrice's oddly shaped fascinator she wore to William and Kate's ceremony was designed by Treacy.  Pascal Le Segretain/Getty Images  But Beatrice wasn't alone in her peculiar debut at that particular royal wedding. Right by her side, was Princess Eugenie of York.  ""The most famous fascinator that I remember is the one worn by Princess Eugenie,"" Walcott said. ""The fascinator is said to be 'outlandish' due to its large size, odd shape, and awkward placement at the front of the head.""  Why do British women wear them?  Fascinators became prevalent because there's a feeling in Britain that one is not fully dressed without something on your head, according to Walcott.  ""Think of the expression 'dressed from head to toe,'"" she added.  The accessory also helps bring the eyes upward, Walcott noted, towards a person's face, and can enhance a woman's overall look.  But Cotton has a practical theory on why they are so widely worn.  ""I think fascinators became popular because they don’t mess with your hair,"" she said.  Max Mumby/Indigo/Getty Images  Cotton is skeptical about what the fashion forecast is for fascinators, as she feels "	1

"“Botched” patient Rajee Narinesingh is a whole new woman!  The 48-year-old was the victim of black market injections received at a “pumping party” in 2005. Instead of cosmetic fillers, a fake physician injected her cheeks, chin, breasts and buttocks with cement and tire sealant.  She asked “Botched’s” Dr. Terry Dubrow and Dr. Paul Nassif for help last year, but they said the surgery to correct the problem was too risky.  Luckily, since then, they found a way to safely help Rajee. The results are truly amazing!  Barcroft TV  In a new segment from Barcroft TV, Rajee shows off her new look.  She says, “I’m ready for the world!"" adding with a smile, “I don’t know if the world is ready for me!”  Check out the video!

A young woman from Hong Kong has claimed that she was scammed into marrying a complete stranger in mainland China during a simulated wedding.  The 21-year-old woman, who has not been named, said she was told to play the role of a bride in a mock wedding in Fuzhou, Fujian province to complete her training to become a wedding planner.  However, during the ceremony in June, she and a man of similar age signed a genuine marriage certificate at a local government office and were officially married.  The young woman from Hong Kong (centre) has claimed that she was scammed into marrying a complete stranger in Fuzhou city, mainland China during a simulated wedding  She only realised she had been tricked upon returning to Hong Kong, where a friend told her it was a marriage scam.  Due to lack of evidence that a crime had taken place, the Hong Kong police were unable to step in. The victim therefore sought help from the Hong Kong Federation of Trade Unions (FTU).  Wearing a mask, baseball cap and dark sunglasses, the woman told reporters at a press conference on Monday that she applied for a Facebook listing for a makeup artist apprenticeship in May.  The job offered an enticing monthly salary of HKD14,000 (£1,385) with free training and required no work experience, according to Apple Daily.  However, during the interview, the alleged scammer convinced her to apply for a wedding planner position instead, telling her that she could earn more money that way.  During the ceremony the woman and the man signed a real marriage document (file photo)  After signing the marriage certificate, the woman said she was told by the alleged scammer that they could ask the mayor to void the marriage record  She was given a week of free training in Hong Kong and was then told to participate in a mock wedding in Fuzhou to pass the course.  After signing the marriage certificate, the woman said she was told by the alleged scammer that they could ask the mayor to void the marriage record.  She currently remains married and it is not known if she would be able to get a divorce. There was no money involved, according to the South China Morning Post.  The motives behind the case are not yet known. However, mainland residents with a spouse in Hong Kong can apply for a permit to settle in the city.  The police are now investigating the case, according to a press release on the FTU website. The union also warned young people against potential job scams on the internet.  There have been 69 cases of job scams reported in the first half of this year, compared with 33 cases in the entire year of 2017, according to Apple Daily citing police figures.  Fraudsters would post job ads on various social media platforms and invite candidates to meet in public places such as cafes or parks. In the process, the scammers would ask victims to surrender their personal identification documents, bank cards and passwords.	0
"Tyler Henry is helping the Arquette siblings find some peace.  Only ET has an exclusive sneak peek at Wednesday's episode, in which Henry sits down with David and Rosanna Arquette to discuss their late sibling, Alexis, who died in September 2016.  ""For some reason, they're having me talk about four kids, the four siblings. The four situation,"" Henry begins, working through his thoughts on a piece of paper.  ""There are four of us,"" David confirms.  ""It's that kind of energy that to me feels almost premature, as I would be viewing, too soon,"" Henry continues. ""There's really a priority of wanting to refer to the siblings, and talking about the siblings. That's where all the focus is. It's like, essential. And I keep hearing, sister, sister, sister. There's a double meaning with this that I'm trying to pick up on.""  ""There's a feeling of like, I wish I could stick around longer, because now like, this is when I would start having opportunities,"" he adds, asking the Arquettes if that relates to them.  ""We had a sibling that passed away a year ago yesterday. Alexis, who was our transgender sister, but was very comfortable with both at the end. It didn't matter,"" Rosanna says. ""Alexis came out 20 years ago and was the famous person who was a boy, who wanted to be a girl, and who was a pioneer. And I think it was sad, because it's more accepted now, and Alexis would be doing such incredible work.""  ""Despite passing at what I would consider untimely, there's a feeling of acceptance. And I know this is kind of hard to explain, but this person gives me this feeling of, 'I was OK to go before I died,'"" Henry replies. ""There's a feeling of 'I've thought about this before.'""  See more of Henry's reading below.  ET sat down with Henry last month, where he opened up about another recent reading, with La Toya Jackson, sharing that he communicated with her late brother, Michael Jackson.  ""It's still so surreal to me,"" Henry said with a laugh. ""When he came through it was so funny because I was expecting him coming through moon-walking.""  ""But he didn't come through that way at all,"" he continued. ""He was very private, very very sweet ... and was connecting with his sister.""  ""[It was] just I'm here, I love you, I'm around,'"" he added.  See more in the video below.  Hollywood Medium With Tyler Henry airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET/PT on E!

Following the split of Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux, a lot of rumors have been speculating on what’s going on behind the scenes. The most recent of these is the regurgitated claim that the “Friends” actress is willing to shell out $6.7 million to buy the silence of her ex-husband, as OK! Australia reported (via Gossip Cop).  Allegations are making the rounds that Justin Theroux is projected to make a lot of money if he writes a book regarding his relationship with Jennifer Aniston. The former celebrity couple had been together for seven years and were married for three, so it goes without saying that Justin knows about Jen’s personal life quite a bit.  However, there is no certainty of any payout whatsoever that has been confirmed by Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux. Friends and close acquaintances of the two also didn’t mention such an agreement, which would make these stories a complete fabrication.  Tabloids have been quick to spew these stories after Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux’s breakup, creating claims that would make catchy headlines. What’s more, the origins of these outright lies are mostly written by magazines that are managed by the same company.  For instance, OK! Australia and Radar Online are overseen by American Media Incorporated. Both these magazines have published stories in the past that were questionable at best and obviously deceptively at worst. Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux are but the latest subjects that these tabloids are covering since their breakup is relatively new.  The ex-couple previously said that while they decided to end their relationship, they’re doing so with no resentment towards each other. In fact, the two even released a statement that even though they’re separated, they still want to maintain their relationship as friends. So the rumors that Justin Theroux is writing a book about his time with Jennifer Aniston to simply make a quick profit are simply unfounded.	0

"Jennifer Lawrence and Darren Aronofsky have sparked rumors that they're back together again after attending an event together last night.

Posing at the Brooklyn Cruise Terminal together, the actress and director had their arms around each other, and didn't look unhappy to see one another at all.  Lawrence wore a flawless Olivier Theyskens dress to the event, as she posed with her ex, or maybe not ex, boyfriend:  Getty Images  As E! reported in December 2017, Lawrence and Aronofsky were still spending time together following their break-up, with a source revealing:  ""They are friends. They are not officially back together but are spending time together again. They never stopped speaking after they broke up. They care about each other. They are just seeing what happens.""  The couple's age gap—Lawrence is 27 and Aronofsky is 49—has always been a talking point in reports about their relationship, but it's clear that they have a connection.  Whether or not Lawrence is actually dating Aronofsky again has yet to be confirmed, but the prospect seems more than possible."	1

"If you're a fan of Riverdale, you're familiar with Bughead, the couple name for Betty and Jughead, two of the show's main characters. Surprisingly, Betty Cooper and Jughead Jones have formed the defining romance for the entire show which is strange, given that the story ostensibly centered on Archie Andrews (as it is based on the classic Archie comics, with a darker, stylized edge).  This, unfortunately, is far from the only thing that is bewildering or illogical about the relationship. Riverdale is not exactly known for its realistic depiction of American teenagers but for displaying a scandalous fantasyland where teenagers find the time to solve crimes, commit crimes, protest against other crimes, and have all kinds of relationship drama in the space of one episode. Bughead is no exception to this; in fact, the couple name being ""Bughead"" might just be the only thing about that does.  From its humble beginnings, Betty pushed aside her feelings for the main protagonist Archie Andrew to be in a relationship with his best friend, Jughead Jones. Bughead has frequently been a difficult and puzzling relationship, but always a popular one.  Fans love seeing the pair deal with unlikely situation, and the Serpent King and Queen have certainly had their share of those. But just because they're popular doesn't mean they make sense all the time, and this list counts down all those incidents where they veered far, far away from the confines of common sense.  Here are 20 Things That Make No Sense About Bughead.  20 They Never Dated In The Comics  This won't come as a surprise to anyone who actually read the comics, but Bughead wasn't a thing until Riverdale made it one. When the show's writers described their version of Jughead, they made it clear he wasn't the same kind of guy as he was in the comics, as he'd be getting the girls just like Archie. Well, they made good on that prediction quickly, as he became Betty's significant other in the first season.  The thing that doesn't make sense is that there is no basis for this in the comics.  Betty was Archie's love interest, along with Veronica.  Jughead was always preoccupied with his food to care about being in a relationship.  Making something up without consulting the comics isn't anything new for Riverdale, but it was still bewildering for anyone who knew anything about the source material.  19 Jughead Isn’t Even Attracted To Betty In The Comics  Not only did Jughead never date Betty in the original comics, there's no real way he ever could have. In his classic canon incarnation, Jughead is a carefree soul who never gave a care about women-- and even expressed derogatory and misogynistic opinions about women. That's just the original; the more recent canon version of Jughead would be even less interested.  In Chip Zdarsky's run on the character, he took the opportunity to make explicit something that had always made sense for the character-- Jughead was ace; a person not attracted to anyone, of any gender.  This means that Riverdale's Bughead makes no sense even for readers of the modern comics, not just those that remember the original ones.  18 Betty's Quick Rebound  As anyone familiar with the source material will tell you, Betty is traditionally the main squeeze of the title character of the comics, Archie. Riverdale nodded to that in its opening episode, showing Betty overwhelmed by her feelings for the red-haired hunk. It all built to an emotional climax, where Archie rejects Betty because he doesn't think he's good enough for her.  It may have seemed for a moment like the writers were building up Barchie as the one true pairing of Riverdale, but if that was the case, nobody told Betty.  Betty seemed to get over her feelings for Archie remarkably quickly, as she was smooching Jughead just five episodes later. Maybe the writers intended Bughead to be a throwaway relationship before Betty eventually returned to Archie, so they had her move to Jughead. Oh, well.  17 The Birthday Par"	1
"Ever wonder how many people actually wash their hands after going to the bathroom? Actress and comedian Tiffany Haddish, recently took a peek into what really happens when unsuspecting bathroom goers try to ditch the soap and water, and let's just say it's not pretty.  It’s all part of Method’s newest PSA about washing your hands.  “She just rinsed — she didn’t put no soap —that’s how you get sick!” Haddish says as she watches a woman skip out on the soap.  Trending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service  As one man DOES decide to lather up, Haddish responds, “Oh yes, he went for the soap, thank you God, a clean man is a good man!  When it comes time to wash your hands after going to the bathroom, here are some facts to consider:  -80% of common infections are spread by hands, according to the CDC.  -111 million workdays will be lost, costing nearly $7 billion in lost productivity between October and May.  -Talking on the phone in the bathroom can spread germs from your respiratory system onto the screen, those particles can live on the surface of your devices for up to 24 hours.  As for Haddish, when she’s not helping make the world a cleaner place, she's been keeping busy acting and bringing her comedy show to venues around the world. She most recently starred in the hit comedy ""Girls Trip,"" alongside Jada Pinkett Smith, Queen Latifah and Regina Hall, and can also be seen on her new Showtime comedy special, “Tiffany Haddish: SHE READY!

"Depending on how you look at it, Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner are the most famous members of their family. Some favor Kim over Kylie and vice versa, but one thing Jenner has surpassed Kardashian in is her net worth. On July 11, Forbes revealed its new cover for the ""America's Women Billionaires"" issue, and Jenner is front and center. The outlet reports that thanks to Kylie Cosmetics, the new mom is almost a billionaire. People on Twitter started pitting the sisters against each other over their money, but Kim Kardashian's tweet about Kylie Jenner's Forbes cover shows that she's the farthest from jealous someone could get: she's proud.  When the Forbes cover was released on July 11, Jenner posted the cover to her Instagram in a moment of pride. She said, ""wow. i can’t believe I’m posting my very own @forbes cover. thank you for this article and the recognition. I’m so blessed to do what i love everyday. i couldn’t have dreamt this up! #KylieCosmetics."" The article finely outlines Jenner's net worth as a result of Kylie Cosmetics, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, her and Kendall Jenner's PacSun clothing line, and her other various money-making schemes, and she's worth $900 million. Kim Kardashian, on the other hand, is worth $350 million, according to Forbes.  It's not like either of those numbers are small or unimpressive, but nevertheless, people on Twitter started trolling Kardashian and Jenner, many joking that Kardashian must be extremely jealous that her youngest sister ended up more successful than her (money wise).  This is Kylie Jenner's Forbes cover.  And here's what Twitter had to say about it.  Lots of people (including Dictionary.com) are arguing that Jenner isn't self-made at all. I mean... I feel like it's obvious that she's objectively not. She was born into a famous family, was on KUWTK because it was about said famous family. Jenner has 100 percent taken the fame she already had and used it to her advantage better than any of her siblings, but self-made? Nah.  Dictionary.com trolled Jenner in the most savage way when this cover came out.  The account quoted Forbes tweet of Jenner's cover and said, ""Self-made means having succeeded in life unaided. Used in a sentence: Forbes says that Kylie Jenner is a self-made woman."" The (pretty true) shade! Jenner is a hard worker, no doubt, and the success of Kylie Cosmetics is thanks to her, but the literal definition of ""self-made"" consists of not having any help. You can't really be self-made when you're born into fame and then you use that fame to your favor. More power to Jenner for creating one of the most successful makeup companies in the world, but that success is in part thanks to the fact that she was born with more privilege than most.  One person who has no issue with Jenner's success, however, is Kim Kardashian.  Kardashian tweeted Jenner's Forbes cover not once, but twice. Her first tweet said, ""CONGRATS @KylieJenner"" with three flame emojis. The second said ""Wait I'm posting this again just because!!!! BILLION DOLLAR BABY"" with a bunch of emojis. Kim K has no time for people saying she's jealous. (She also posted a video on her Instagram story in honor of Jenner.)  One fan came to the family's defense about their work ethic and the doubt about their success.  The tweet said, ""The Kardashian Jenner women are the smartest, hardest working women that I know. They are the first to start their work day before the sun rises and always the last ones to end it. Debate and hate all you want but their success and longevity is no accident."" Kardashian quoted the tweet with three clapping emojis.  Whether you think Kylie Jenner is ""self-made"" or not, one person we can thank for all of this is Kris Jenner. Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian, and the Devil may work hard, but Kris Jenner works harder."	0
SPOILER ALERT: Do not read ahead if you have not watched the finale of Arie Luyendyk Jr.’s season of “The Bachelor” or “After the Final Rose.”  As host Chris Harrison warns each and every season, “The Bachelor” finale is always dramatic. But this week’s controversial closer had an unprecedented ending, which has since stirred an uproar.  On Monday night’s finale, “The Bachelor” Arie Luyendyk Jr. proposed to Becca Kufrin and the couple was engaged. However, over the next two months, after the season had wrapped, Luyendyk had a change of heart and realized he made the wrong choice and was actually in love with runner-up Lauren Burnham, so he broke up with Kufrin — and the entire thing was caught on film.  ABC’s cameras followed Luyendyk as he broke off his engagement to Kufrin, and the network aired the scene completely unedited, showing exactly what happened between the pair during the difficult conversation.  The following night on “After the Final Rose,” Kufrin was named ABC’s next leading lady who will star in “The Bachelorette,” and her journey to find love again began last night on “After the Final Rose.”  Meanwhile, Luyendyk sat down with Burnham on “After the Final Rose,” as the glowing couple told America about their rekindled relationship over the past two months, and then Luyendyk proposed to Burnham. The two are now engaged, and have embarked on a mini media tour, sitting down with Jimmy Kimmel, and making appearances today on ABC’s “Good Morning America” and “Live With Kelly and Ryan.”  The dramatic two-part finale has garnered overwhelming support for Kufrin, but has caused a social media outcry in response to Luyendyk’s behavior.  Here, ABC’s executive in charge of “The Bachelor” franchise, Robert Mills, senior VP of alternative series, specials, and late-night programming, talks to Variety about filming the breakup and choosing to air the footage completely unedited — plus, what he thinks about Kufrin as the next “Bachelorette.”  Looking back on the entire season, what do you think overall?  I liked this season. I think it’s pretty clear we made a conscious decision to do a more straightforward season of “The Bachelor,” and I liked that because at the end of the day, we really believe in this concept and really want it to be about finding love and making connections. I’m really proud of it, creatively. I’m not blind that the ratings are down, so that’s a bit of a disappointment, and I wish that the audience had liked this season a little better. We’ve seen some negativity both toward Arie and the some of the people in this season and the show in general, so every season when the show ends, me and the producers take a look at what worked and what didn’t and we will work to make a phenomenal season of “The Bachelorette.”  What went into the decision to film Arie and Becca after the proposal? You had never done that before.  It lends credence to the fact that “The Bachelor” is not just over the top because one of the problems [with the show] is that you’re dating people in a way that you never would in real life, and then you have to start a life with this person, and so in the finale, you actually see what happens in the real world. It’s incredibly relatable and it’s a place we’ve all been. The stuff you see here is stuff that we’ve all done and we’ve all been through. There’s heartbreak and there is hope, but it is riveting and it’s why we watch “The Bachelor” because when good or bad things happen, we all want to relate that these things happen to other people. When the show really does that, it’s when it’s at it’s best.  What was your reaction when Arie started having second thoughts, and wanted to break up with Becca to get back together with Lauren?  You go to the place where you say this will be great, riveting TV, but you’ve got to realize that these are real people — not just Becca, but Arie and Lauren — and this could happen to anyone, so I think that makes it really difficult. Part of the importance of do	1
Ellen DeGeneres — after a fight to end all fights that climaxed with Ellen ripping off her wedding ring — has fled the marital home she shares with Portia de Rossi , and multiple sources have claimed the stage is set for a blockbuster $400 million divorce! Photo credit: Getty Images/InStar  The National ENQUIRER has learned Ellen left In a bombshell world exclusive,has learned Ellen left the couple’s love nest and has agreed to an off-listing sale of the marital estate they bought together just eight months ago! Photo credit: Mega  “It’s all very shady and ominous. Ellen went to great lengths to keep the news from their close friends to avoid being asked questions,” an insider claimed. “She and Portia were fighting more and more. Eventually, what normally would have been a routine back-and-forth turned nasty .” Photo credit: Mega  Ellen has publicly insisted the couple’s marriage is on solid ground. But sources have exclusively told The ENQUIRER the pair have been spending nights alone, and now they appear to be living completely apart. Photo credit: Mega  Property records show Ellen and Portia — who will be married for ten years on Aug. 16 — maintained two separate residences on the six-acre equestrian estate in exclusive Montecito, Calif., which recently sold for $11 million. Photo credit: Files  In yet another clue to their marital woes , just weeks after they paid $7.2 million for the sprawling property last September, Ellen quietly snapped up a place of her own nine miles away in Carpinteria! Photo credit: Files  Sources claimed the $77 million-a-year TV chatterbox is holed up at this $18.6 million beachfront mansion, which she secretly purchased in October 2017. “It didn’t bode well for the long term when Ellen bought that home,” a source claimed. Photo credit: Mega  The talk-show host is a notorious house-flipper — investing in properties before cashing out when the real-estate market heats up. But according to sources, her recent spree is less about the money and more about having separate residences as she and Portia inch closer toward officially separating. Photo credit: Mega  “They spend less and less time together ,” said one source. “In fact, they’ve been living separate lives. It’s gotten so bad that they hardly say a word to each other all day.” Photo credit: Mega  “Portia feels neglected and mistreated,” another insider told The ENQUIRER. “She feels as if she supports Ellen in everything she does, while Ellen just gets aggravated and judgmental when it comes to her needs.” Photo credit: Mega  If they do announce a divorce, it promises to be one of the most expensive in Hollywood history! “With their combined fortune, future earnings and property totaling $400 million, it’ll be a good day to be their divorce lawyers!” claimed an insider. Photo credit: Mega  “The idea of going through that mess is probably the glue that’s kept them together this long!” A sour-faced Ellen was pictured without her wedding ring during a Beverly Hills shopping spree on April 20. At the time, talk heated up that her high-profile union was under pressure. Photo credit: Mega  But in the days that followed, she and Portia paraded their “happy” marriage in front of paparazzi at multiple Hollywood hot spots, usually arm in arm and sporting painful smiles. “Nobody is convinced,” a source said. “They aren’t intimate!” Photo credit: Mega  While a friend of Ellen’s brushed off talk of divorce, the couple’s marriage has exploded many times before, according to inside sources. But The ENQUIRER’s mole fears the worst as Portia continues to spend days alone at her own $17.3 million bolt-hole in Beverly Hills. Photo credit: Mega  “It’s usually Portia who walks out whenever they fight,” the insider claimed. “Ellen has a great TV personality, but at home she’s a bore who goes to bed every night at nine.” “Arrested Development” star Portia has also complained Ellen cares more about her fur-shedding cats and dogs, said the source.

"Image caption Angelina Jolie, Gwyneth Paltrow and Cara Delevingne have all spoken out  Salma Hayek, Rose McGowan and Gwyneth Paltrow are among dozens of women who have come forward with allegations ranging from rape to sexual harassment by movie mogul Harvey Weinstein.  He is currently facing five charges relating to two women in New York.  He has previously admitted his behaviour has ""caused a lot of pain"" but has described many of the allegations against him as ""patently false"".  His spokesperson has said ""any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied"" and there were ""never any acts of retaliation"" against women who turned him down.  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Clockwise from top left: Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie, Cara Delevingne, Mira Sorvino, Rosanna Arquette and Lea Seydoux  Here are some of those who have made allegations against him.  Rose McGowan  Image copyright Getty Images  The actress has accused Weinstein of raping her by performing oral sex in a hotel at the Sundance Film Festival in 1997, when she was 23 and had just appeared in Scream.  She later reached a $100,000 settlement with him - and says he offered her $1m for a further non-disclosure deal to stay silent. She declined and has been one of his most vocal accusers.  Annabella Sciorra  Image copyright Getty Images  The Emmy-nominated former Sopranos actress has alleged that Weinstein forced himself into her apartment in New York in 1992 and raped her.  ""I was so ashamed of what happened,"" Sciorra told the New Yorker. ""And I fought. I fought. But still I was like, Why did I open that door?""  Ashley Judd  Image copyright Getty Images  The actress says Weinstein asked her to go to his hotel room under the guise of a business meeting, but appeared in a bathrobe and asked if he could give her a massage or if she could watch him shower.  She refused, and says he got revenge by seeking to damage her career. Director Peter Jackson has come forward to say he removed her from a casting list ""as a direct result"" of what he now thinks was ""false information"" provided by Weinstein.  In May 2018 Judd sued Weinstein claiming he damaged her career in retaliation for her rejecting his sexual advances but a Los Angeles court later dismissed her sexual harassment suit.  Her defamation claim may still proceed, the judge said.  Mira Sorvino  Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Mira Sorvino was photographed at a Weinstein Company party in January 2017  The Mighty Aphrodite star says he harassed her in a hotel room in 1995. ""He started massaging my shoulders, which made me very uncomfortable, and then tried to get more physical, sort of chasing me around,"" she said.  Like with Ashley Judd, Peter Jackson said Weinstein warned him off casting her.  Salma Hayek  Image copyright AFP/Getty Image caption Hayek said Weinstein threatened to kill her  The Frida actress says she turned down repeated sexual advances from Weinstein while making the 2002 film Frida.  And she says his persuasion tactics included threats. Hayek said Weinstein once told her: ""I will kill you, don't think I can't.""  Asia Argento  Image copyright Getty Images  The Italian actress and director Asia Argento says she reluctantly agreed to give him a massage in a hotel room on the French Riviera, but he then raped her.  Weinstein ""terrified me, and he was so big"", she said. ""It wouldn't stop. It was a nightmare.""  Lucia Evans  Lucia Evans - nee Stoller - encountered Weinstein in 2004 in a New York club when she was an aspiring actress. She says she was forced to perform oral sex by the producer after going to his office for what she thought was a casting meeting.  ""The type of control he exerted, it was very real,"" she told The New Yorker. ""Even just his presence was intimidating.""  Paz de la Huerta  Image copyright Getty Images  The Boardwalk Empire star has accused Weinstein of raping her twice in New York in 2010.  The first time was after he offered her a ride home, and t"	1

"Things are getting serious between Brad Pitt and his new girlfriend Neri Oxman, and a new report claims that he is ready to introduce her to his six children. Is the couple ready to take the next step in their relationship?  “Brad cannot get enough of her and he thinks the next step is having her meet his children,” claims an insider.  The source also said that Oxman – an MIT professor – “wears the pants in their relationship,” but Pitt doesn’t have a problem with that. The 54-year-old is telling friends that his is in love and his sexual chemistry with Oxman is “off the hook.”  Pitt split with Angelina Jolie back in September 2016 and the two are still trying to reach a settlement in their divorce and a custody agreement for Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, Knox, 9, and Vivienne, 9.

Pitt wants the kids in Los Angeles and to see them on the regular custody schedule. He is not okay with them being gone for an extended period of time. He believes it is best for them to stay home.

Opting for a bold fuchsia color, Kate Middleton looked stunning at Princess Eugenie's royal wedding to Jack Brooksbank today. The Duchess of Cambridge stuck to her go-to designers and wore an Alexander McQueen dress and Philip Treacy hat for the occasion.  Topping off her look, Kate accessorized with a matching fuchsia fascinator and veil paired with classic black pumps and a clutch. Her McQueen dress featured a pleated waistline and puffed sleeves. Typically one to stick to a neutral color palette, the look made for an unexpected splash of color for the Duchess of Cambridge.  Getty Images  After arriving with Prince William, the couple shared a rare moment of PDA inside St. George's Chapel, holding hands sweetly as they sat in the pews.  A sweet moment between Prince William and Kate Middleton! #RoyalWedding2 https://t.co/a7pqNEt6Ra pic.twitter.com/72mEsR5AhN — Yahoo Canada Style (@YahooStyleCA) October 12, 2018  During the ceremony, the couple was seated without their two eldest kids, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, because the tots were busy serving as pageboy and bridesmaid in the ceremony.  For her last royal wedding appearance, at the May nuptials for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, Kate also wore an Alexander McQueen dress. It was the third time she re-wore the pale yellow frock—she had previously worn it to both Princess Charlotte's christening and to Queen Elizabeth II's birthday party.

The Duchess of Sussex, however, opted for a navy Givenchy dress and matching fascinator.	1

"For those wondering how much Taylor Swift is still enjoying keeping her love life almost completely private, People has an update. Apparently t's still awesome being semi-secretly with British boyfriend of over a year, Joe Alwyn. “She seems to be in a great place both career and love wise,” a source told the outlet. Alwyn tries to attend her concert dates when he can, the source added. Footage of him there hasn't really been shared on social media, except for at the first show—a testament to how undercover these two can keep things.  Alwyn is really the best though, the source made abundantly clear: “Joe is just an amazing boyfriend. He is very supportive. Taylor adores his family. She’s in a very good place.”  Swift and Alwyn were last photographed out together on a North London pub date at the end of May. And that outing was rare itself: Swift has only been photographed out with Alwyn a couple times and has never spoken about him besides in her songs.  Last August, a source told People that this whole keeping the relationship out of the press thing really works for her. ""Her decision to keep her relationship with Joe quiet is making her happy,"" the source said then. ""They have been getting to know each other slowly without any pressure.”  In People's new report today, its source also mentioned that Swift “has a few days off for July 4th” but gave no indication whether she'd throw the usual Taymerica party for her celeb friends at her Rhode Island estate. She didn't last year, but the year before, it was truly a ""I Heart TS"" spectacle."	0

"Media playback is not supported on this device 'I would hope that I would win against Serena'  Serena Williams disputes John McEnroe's claims that she would struggle to be in the world's top 700 if she was on the men's circuit.  But the male player ranked 701 in the world - Dmitry Tursunov - believes he could beat her.  Speaking to US radio station NPR, seven-time Grand Slam champion McEnroe said of former world number one Williams, who has won an Open-era record 23 Grand Slams: ""If she played the men's circuit she'd be, like, 700 in the world.""  He qualified the comments by saying: ""That doesn't mean I don't think Serena is an incredible player, and I suppose anything's possible; maybe at some point a women's tennis player can be better than anybody.""  But he added: ""I just haven't seen that in any other sport, and I haven't seen it in tennis. If she had to just play the men's circuit, it would be an entirely different story.""  Williams later responded on Twitter: ""Dear John, I adore and respect you but please please keep me out of your statements that are not factually based.  ""I've never played anyone ranked ""there"" nor do I have time. Respect me and my privacy as I'm trying to have a baby. Good day sir.""  Williams, 35, won her 23rd Grand Slam title at the Australian Open in January. It later transpired she was pregnant at the time  'She is pregnant, and I'm not'  Tursunov, 34, was once ranked as high as 20th in the world.  The Russian told BBC World Service Sport he did not think McEnroe was ""trying to talk women's tennis down"" but said ""the reality"" was that ""men are stronger in general"".  ""I would hope that I would win against Serena,"" he added.  ""It would be a similar argument to: who would run faster, the fastest woman or the fastest man? Tennis is becoming more and more a physical sport, so it's going to be hard for a woman to beat the men.  ""It's not black and white, there are lots of factors to take into account. Physically I might not be in the best shape of my life but as an overall package I'm much better than my ranking would suggest. She is pregnant, and I'm not.  ""I've never heard John say anything absolutely stupid - he knows his stuff. What he said about her being an incredible player is correct - explosive, powerful and she puts in a lot of work. But I would hope that I would win.""  Battle of the sexes  A crowd of 30,000 watched Billie Jean King take on Bobby Riggs in Houston in 1973  Tennis matches between men and women have occurred before, mostly notably back in 1973 when Billie Jean King took on fellow American Bobby Riggs.  Riggs, the world number one in the 1940s, retired in 1951 and at the age of 55 believed he could beat any of the top female players.  King originally declined to play Riggs and Australian Margaret Court - at the time the top female player in the world - stepped in. Riggs won 6-2 6-1.  But later that year, the top ranked women's player King - 26 years younger than Riggs at 29 - took him on in an exhibition match at the Houston Astrodome and won 6-4 6-3 6-3.  A third 'Battle of the Sexes' match took in 1992 between American former world number one Jimmy Connors, aged 40 at the time, and Czech and American Martina Navratilova, who was 35.  The match took place under special rules to make it more competitive - Connors was allowed only one serve per point, and Navratilova was allowed to hit into half the doubles court. Connors won 7-5 6-2."	0
“Dynasty” is coming back to television in the form of a younger, sexier, sassier CW series.  In anticipation of the fall debut, the cast and creators of The CW’s “Dynasty” addressed the press for the first time on Wednesday at the Television Critics Association press tour in Beverly Hills for a well-received panel about the differences and similarities to the original primetime soap opera.  “You see the word ‘Dynasty,’ and you’re like, ‘Oh yes,'” exclaimed star Elizabeth Gillies, who plays Fallon Carrington in the modernized reboot, recalling when the script first landed in her lap.  The cast and executive producers, Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage of “Gossip Girl” and writer Sallie Patrick, expressed their desire to honor the original characters, while also making them their own. “I wanted to bring my own thing to her. I think she’s feisty as ever,” Gillies said.  Here are 10 more things we learned about The CW’s “Dynasty” reboot:  1. More original characters will appear in The CW series — including Alexis.  Aside from the core cast, based on the original “Dynasty” characters, the team plans to bring back some more familiar faces, namely Alexis, who was originally played by Joan Collins.  “All in due time,” Schwartz teased, before Patrick confirmed that you will see Alexis during the first season, though she didn’t say who will be cast in the iconic role. “We don’t know yet,” Patrick said of the Alexis casting. “We’re going to see if it works out.”  Even before Alexis shows up on screen, the character’s presence will be felt throughout the episodes. “We do refer to her a lot,” Schwartz said to which Patrick added, “We’re building up the spirit of Alexis. She’s definitely there in the other characters.”  2. The original “Dynasty” was homophobic. The CW version will be far from that.  Blake Carrington’s (Show) son, Steven (James Mackay), is gay and he’ll be out-and-proud.  “The relationship between Blake and Steven is not about sexuality. Steven is confidently gay, Blake accepts him,” Schwartz said, explaining that the father-son duo will instead fight about other things like “environmental causes.”  3. Today’s politics will make the 2017 “Dynasty” more relevant than the original.  When asked about President Donald Trump’s power and wealth and how that may influence the show, Schwartz said the series’ influence is bigger than Trump.  “We are definitely living in an age of dynasties,” he said. “Whether it’s the Trumps or the Clintons or the Kardashians or the Murdochs, our news is filled with the worlds of family dynasties and that was exciting for us.”  4. The spelling of Crystal’s name (rather than Krystle, like the original character) has a lot of meaning behind it.  Actress Nathalie Kelley, who’s from Peru, portrays the character that was originally played by Linda Evans. But in the new and updated series, Crystal is Latina and from Venezuela.  “This modern version represents a more current picture of what’s happening in America. The diversity of the cast really represents that,” Kelley said. “To weave that into the narrative of ‘Dynasty’ is really exciting and important to talk about the geo-politics of Venezuela on a CW show.”  5. This version of “Dynasty” will focus on powerful and ambitious women.  The two female central stars, Gillies and Kelley, will both portray career-hungry women, who are fighting for power of the family company.  “Both of these women are ambitious career women … they want to run this business,” Schwartz said. “Having Crystal have a more senior role in the company, not just being the secretary, makes her more credible of vying for control of this company with Fallon.”  Savage said that the original show “really found itself” when the two women started sparring against each other, though in the ’80s series, their catfights were over a man, rather than a business.  “They’re competitive, they’re both smart, they’re ambitious. You have the great head-to-head and [we’re] kicking it off with that great	1

The next 48 hours leading up to the cast announcement are likely to be pretty hectic, so I thought I better get this posted sooner rather than later. Here’s the list of all the cast rumors we’ve heard/reported on for season 24 – as always, they’re divided into categories. Legitimate possibilities are rumors that we think have some validity, based on who is reporting them; long shots are rumors from a source that we don’t necessarily trust, but it’s possible they could be valid; pure randomness is general observations/weird stuff we’ve noticed that may or may not indicate anything, but is interesting nonetheless; wannabes/campaigners are celebs that have expressed interest in doing the show, but we have no reason to believe they’ve actually been asked to do the show; and the definite “no’s” are celebs that have specifically said they won’t do the show.  If anything new crops up between now & the announcement, I’ll do my best to update…but no guarantees. Tomorrow is Fat Tuesday, and I’ve got hella king cakes to get ready 😎  Legitimate possibilities :  Normani Kordei  Simone Biles  Mr. T  Chris Kattan  Erika Jayne  Nancy Kerrigan  Nick Viall  Heather Morris  Charo  Bonner Bolton  Rashad Jennings  Longshots :  Someone from Pretty Little Liars/Ashley Benson  Someone from Property Brothers/Jonathan Scott  Someone from Storage Wars/Barry Weiss  Rachel Lindsay  Russell Brand  Usher  Billy Bush  Pure Randomness :  Shemar Moore  Victor Cruz  Gracie Gold  Ricky Schroeder  Jose Medina  Wannabes/Campaigners :  Mary Lou Retton  Stassi Schroeder  Dina Parise  The Definite No’s :  Hugh Grant  Ashlee Simpson  Michelle Obama  Hillary Clinton	0

"American retired professional wrestler  Brianna Monique Danielson[8][9] (née Garcia-Colace; born November 21, 1983) is an American retired professional wrestler. She appeared frequently with her twin sister Nikki as The Bella Twins. She is also a one-time WWE Divas Champion.  Early life [ edit ]  Brianna Monique Garcia-Colace was born in San Diego, California, and raised on a farm in Scottsdale, Arizona.[10] She was born sixteen minutes after her twin sister, Nicole, to parents Jon Garcia and Kathy Colace.[11] She is of Mexican and Italian descent.[5] Keen soccer enthusiasts, she along with her sister played for the Scottsdale club in elementary school. She graduated from Chaparral High School in 2002.[11] She then returned to San Diego for college,[10] and relocated to Los Angeles a year later, where she worked as a waitress at the Mondrian Hotel while trying to find an agent.[11]  She then started modeling, acting, and doing promotional work.[5][12] She made her first national TV appearance on the Fox reality show Meet My Folks.[11][13] Following this appearance, the Garcia twins were hired to be the World Cup Twins for Budweiser and were photographed holding the World Cup trophy.[14] Brie and her sister Nikki were contestants in the 2006 ""International Body Doubles twins search"".[15] Brie and Nikki later participated in the 2006 WWE Diva Search, but they did not make the cut.[16]  Professional wrestling career [ edit ]  World Wrestling Entertainment/WWE [ edit ]  Florida Championship Wrestling (2007–2008) [ edit ]  Brianna and Nicole were signed to developmental contracts by World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) in June 2007 and were assigned to Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW), WWE's then-developmental territory, in Tampa, Florida.[13] On September 15, 2007, the twins made their in-ring debut. Dubbed The Bella Twins, they defeated Nattie Neidhart and Krissy Vaine with Victoria Crawford as the special guest referee.[1][17] The duo quickly started a scripted rivalry with Neidhart and Crawford, and had a series of matches against them throughout October 2007. As a part of their on-screen personas, they switched places behind the referee's back if one of them was hurt. They also occasionally competed in mixed tag team matches, teaming with male wrestlers including Kofi Kingston and Robert Anthony. They also made some non-wrestling appearances on Heath Miller's Happy Hour promo segment.[17]  Starting in December 2007, they managed Derrick Linkin,[17] but this storyline was cut short when Linkin was released in January 2008. They then resumed their feud with Neidhart and Crawford, wrestling them throughout much of 2008.[18] After Neidhart was called up to the WWE roster in April 2008, Milena Roucka took her place in the feud.[18][19] The twins also competed in bikini contests, and wrestled against other competitors including Katie Lea Burchill and Daisy. Their last FCW appearance was on September 2, when they competed in a Divas battle royal won by Miss Angela.[18]  The Bella Twins (2008–2011) [ edit ]  On the August 29, 2008 episode of SmackDown, Brianna debuted as Brie Bella and defeated Victoria.[20] She quickly began a scripted rivalry with Victoria and Victoria's accomplice, Natalya, and had a series of matches against them.[21][22][23] In each match, Brie would roll out of the ring and go underneath it, emerging and appearing revived, and then win the match.[21][24] On the October 31 episode of SmackDown, when Brie went under the ring Victoria grabbed her legs, but a second pair of legs kicked her off, implying that a second person was under the ring.[25] The following week on SmackDown, Brie picked up a win against Victoria and then ran under the ring to escape Natalya and Victoria, but Victoria and Natalya both reached for Brie under the ring, resulting in both Nicole and Brie being pulled out. The twins then attacked them and celebrated afterward.[26] Nicole was then introduced as Nikki Bella. The twins had their firs"	1

It’s only been a year since Beyoncé broke the internet when she gave birth to not one but two babies with her husband, Jay-Z. But is she already ready for another one? The BeyHive sure think so after the 36-year-old singer was photographed with what fans claim to be a very obvious baby bump.  To prove their theory, many fans are referencing a video from a recent concert on Beyoncé’s On the Run Tour II with Jay-Z. The video shows Beyoncé in a sparkly white outfit with what fans are confident is a small baby bump sticking out of her midsection.  In addition to Star magazine (a not-so-reliable tabloid, if we’re being honest) reporting that the singer is “over the moon” with her pregnancy, fans are also referencing a tour outfit that they believe is a secret message from Beyoncé herself, proving that she’s pregnant. The outfit, a skin-tight gold dress that Beyoncé pairs with a giant cape, features a heart on her midsection, which many fans believe represents her baby’s heartbeat.Given Bey and Jay-Z’s love for the number four (4:44 is the title of Jay-Z’s last album and their wedding anniversary is on April 4), it makes sense that the couple is expecting their fourth child, as fans have noted. Needless to say, the BeyHive is alive with speculation (and worry that Bey might cancel the rest of her tour to go on maternity leave.)  As excited as we would be for another Beyoncé pregnancy, it’s important to note that neither she nor Jay-Z have confirmed anything. And until they do, all rumors are speculation. Likewise, as Lili Reinhart, Drew Barrymore, Blac Chyna, and dozens of other celebrities who have fought off pregnancy rumors have proven, bloating is a real thing and assuming that someone is pregnant based on how much their stomach resembles a “baby bump” is dangerous and a form of body-shaming.  We get it. A Beyoncé pregnancy would make 2018. But let’s not get ahead of ourselves.	0
Taking the next step! Brant Daugherty is engaged to Kimberly Hidalgo.  The Pretty Little Liars alum, 32, revealed via Instagram on Monday, February 26, that he popped the question to his girlfriend during their trip to Amsterdam.  “So we have some exciting news to share with everyone… A few weeks ago @kimhidalgo and I visited Amsterdam and I asked her to marry me!” he captioned a photo with Hidalgo, who showed off her new ring in the shot. “More importantly, she said yes. Now she’s stuck with me forever. Sucker.”  Hidalgo posted the same photo to her Instagram on Monday, simply writing, “Ok @brantdaugherty, I’ll marry you. 🤗💍.”  The pair, who started dating in October 2016, also shared photos from their aforementioned trip to Amsterdam via Instagram earlier this month.  “Amsterdam for Valentine’s Day 😍,” the Dancing with the Stars alum captioned a video of his hotel room in the Netherlands on February 14.  Daugherty is best known for his roles as Noel Kahn on Pretty Little Liars and as Sawyer in Fifty Shades Freed, which is currently in theaters. The author of the Fifty Shades trilogy, EL James, congratulated the pair on their engagement. “Fabulous news!!! Congratulations both of you,” she commented on Daugherty’s Instagram.  Hidalgo, who has made guest appearances on Grey’s Anatomy and How I Met Your Mother, also heard from some famous faces about the news. “Yaaaaaaaaas girl,” Ashley Tisdale commented on her photo.  “AHHHHHHHHH” Sarah Hyland wrote.	1

Looks like it’s time to say our goodbyes—and transfer Vitamin C’s “Graduation (Friends Forever)” to cassette tape. Though Netflix has yet to officially renew 13 Reasons Why for a third season, if it does, the teen drama’s central character, Hannah Baker, will apparently be absent. Actress Katherine Langford, who plays Hannah, broke the news to Entertainment Weekly on Friday.  “For me, we told Hannah’s story so fully in Season 1,” Langford said, adding that her character was basically in purgatory during Season 2. “Then being able to officially say goodbye to her—it definitely felt like time. For me, letting Hannah go was in Season 1; Season 2 was for Clay to let her go.” Representatives for Netflix declined to comment on the status of the show’s renewal or cancellation, but confirmed that Langford’s involvement with the series will officially end with Season 2.  Langford made her on-screen debut in 13 Reasons Why, so the series will always be special to her, she said. Looking forward, however, Langford said she’s also excited about what’s yet to come: “Even though the show is so huge, and I’m so thankful to have had the opportunity to play Hannah, it still is just one thing that I’ve done, and since then I feel very grateful to have been a part of Love, Simon, and I have another film, Spontaneous. But I think ultimately, I feel like playing Hannah was such a small part of me that was magnified, and I’m just really excited to, over the next few months or years, show the rest of me.”  The series can certainly survive without Hannah, considering she’s been dead since Season 1. Her constant presence was one of the lower points of Season 2, if only because it felt forced; the show’s plot also ground to a halt every time Clay began to converse with her newly present ghost.  Still, her loss will alter the alchemy of the series, stripping it of the mysterious storytelling element that differentiated the first season—and some of the second. Season 1 was structured around a series of tapes that revealed the exact circumstances that led Hannah, already dead, to commit suicide. In Season 2, fans learned about other aspects of Hannah’s life that retrospectively shifted her story into a new light. With that layer of mystery gone, what’s left will likely be a far more standard teen drama—not necessarily a bad thing, but almost certainly a factor Netflix will consider as it weighs whether to renew the series. Given that cliffhanger ending in the finale, however, a junior year for 13 Reasons Why still seems likely.	1

Heidi is a soon-to-be mom who posts videos of her dogs, and Spencer is best known as a reality TV scholar who dishes to the New York Times about pop culture in the era of President Donald Trump. But Speidi earned their reality TV status ten years ago this week when they launched a public feud against their Hills co-star Laura Conrad.  Their fight was anything but scholarly. Heidi and Lauren were once the Laverne and Shirley of MTV. They roomed together in West Hollywood, and fans expected the series to end with them serving as each other's bridesmaids. That is until Heidi started dating Spencer in season two. Lauren advised her to ditch him, but she refused. On the season finale, Heidi moved in with Spencer. Her friendship with Lauren was done.  On August 5, 2007, roughly a week before the season three premiere, Perez Hilton reported rumors that Lauren had filmed a sex tape with her ex, Laguna Beach cast member Jason Wahler. Lauren denied the claims to US Weekly, according to Gawker, saying, ""Honestly, they videotape my life five days out of the week. I don't need additional footage, you know?""  Lauren pointed the finger at her ex-roommate and her villainous boyfriend. As Tyra Banks later explained on her talk show while holding paper dolls of Spencer and Heidi: ""Spencer and Heidi have started a rumor about [Lauren]. It's a rumor about something really bad. Spencer and Heidi say that [Lauren has] a sex tape out there."" The accusation carried such dramatic intensity because fans had watched Lauren and Heidi's friendship strengthen over the course of the preceding seasons.  ""[Lauren's] the douche, the psycho,"" Spencer responded on Philadelphia's Q102 FM during his press tour for season three. Heidi likewise denied Lauren's claims.    Read more: The Undying Love of Spencer and Heidi Pratt  On August 6, he went even further, launching SpencerPratt.com and attacking his enemy on the new platform. ""For all you Haters- Please feel free to Hate on me here on my blog/board were I actually read comments! … But if you hate me because you think I ruined Lauren and Heidi friendship…you have your facts all wrong!"" he wrote in his inauguratory post. ""Lauren ruined Heidi and Laurens friendship when she told Heidi that she could not be friends with her as long as she dated me … when those cameras turn off LC(BEEF CURTAINS) is a completely different person…she goes back to being the spoiled brat that made her famous on Laguna Beach.""  According to US Weekly, MTV ""suspended"" Spencer and Heidi's press appearances in response to the pair's ""trash-talking."" The news only boosted awareness of Speidi's war against Lauren. ""It's her party and she'll ban Spencer and Heidi if she wants to!"" TMZ blurbed on August 10. Lauren had allegedly booted Heidi and Spencer from MTV's premiere party, and US reported that MTV ordered Spencer and Heidi to walk the red carpet early and leave once Lauren arrived.  Looking back, Spencer believes the reality was even worse than the news reports. ""Actually, [Lauren] told MTV if they didn't stop filming with me she would quit and they told her then quit,"" he tells Broadly in a direct message. (Lauren's representative did not immediately respond to Broadly's request for comment.)  In the third season premiere, fans watched a similar party scene. At a club called Les Deux, Heidi hands Lauren a letter lamenting their dilapidated friendship. It does not mention the rumors. ""She won't fucking admit it,"" Lauren complains. She refuses to see her.  ""It's her problem,"" Heidi tells herself. But when Lauren flees the club, Heidi follows her.  ""You're not my friend anymore,"" Lauren tells her. ""I always feel bad for you,"" Heidi cries. She wants to know why Lauren hates her. ""You know what you did!"" La"	1
Luis Fonsi did it again as the well-known Despacito singer took the stage at The Voice. He not only has the number one song it the world right now, but he managed to rock the stage at the season 12 finale of the show.  The 39-year-old singer performed the fresh hit alongside Daddy Yankee and the show’s contestant Mark Isaiah who carried out with grace Justin Bieber’s verses and chorus.  Fonsi joined Bieber on stage during the Purpose Tour’s show in Puerto Rico, and there they played the remix for the first time together, and it was unbelievable.  Before Fonsi hit the NBC stage, he admitted that he is honored to be there on that special night for him.  The preparation for his performance took some time to come out as great is it did.  “It’s tough when it gets down to the finals. These final four voices, performers are amazing,” he admitted being proud to be there.  “I don’t have a favorite. They’re all very different,” he stated.  “We have a showman and dancers, a country star, we have a rock ‘n’ roller that’s an amazing guitar player, and then we have a beautiful, young talent,” he continued.  If you’re one of his Instagram followers, then you might know by now that he has had some very busy weeks from performing at the BillBoard Latin Music Awards to heading to Europe for playing his concerts.  So where does he stand now after his amazing performance, and what are his plans?  He plans on having fun, of course, and we believe that it’s only natural. “I’m going to party! I’m going to enjoy this moment. You know, it’s been an amazing five months,” he admitted.  “So after this tonight, we’re going to enjoy it with the audience and then some friends,” Fonsi plans.  “Then tomorrow I’m flying back to Europe to keep touring, promo and getting ready for my tour that starts July 1.”  Advertisement  He has also got some new music coming on our way pretty soon, and we can’t wait to hear it. He said that he just wants people to get where his head is, musically speaking. His upcoming album is scheduled for release sometime before the end of this year.	1
"""The Today Show"" redirects here. For other programming called ""Today"", see Today  American morning television program broadcast on NBC  Today, also called The Today Show, is an American news and talk morning television show that airs on NBC. The program debuted on January 14, 1952. It was the first of its genre on American television and in the world, and after 67 years of broadcasting it is the fifth-longest-running American television series.  Originally a weekday two-hour program from 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m., it expanded to Sundays in 1987 and Saturdays in 1992. The weekday broadcast expanded to three hours in 2000, and to four hours in 2007 (though over time, the third and fourth hours became distinct entities). Today's dominance was virtually unchallenged by the other networks until the late 1980s, when it was overtaken by ABC's Good Morning America.  Today retook the Nielsen ratings lead the week of December 11, 1995, and held onto that position for 852 consecutive weeks until the week of April 9, 2012, when Good Morning America topped it again. Today maintained its No. 2 status behind GMA from the summer of 2012 until it regained the lead in the aftermath of anchor Matt Lauer's departure in November 2017.[2][3] In 2002, Today was ranked No. 17 on TV Guide's 50 Greatest TV Shows of All Time.[4]  The entertainment magazine Variety reported the 2016 advertising revenue during the first two hours of the show was $508.8 million.[5]  History [ edit ]  Founding [ edit ]  Logo used from 2009 to 2013  The show's first broadcast aired on January 14, 1952 as the brainchild of television executive Sylvester Weaver, who was then vice president of NBC. Weaver was president of the company from 1953 to 1955, during which time Today's late-night companion The Tonight Show premiered. In pre-production, the show's proposed working title was The Rise and Shine Revue.[6] The show was first supervised by Jerome Alan Danzig.[7]  Today was the first program of its genre when it premiered with original host Dave Garroway. The program blended national news headlines, interviews with newsmakers, lifestyle features, other light news and gimmicks (including the presence of the chimpanzee J. Fred Muggs who served as the show's mascot during the early years), and local news updates from the network's stations. It has spawned several other shows of a similar type, including ABC's Good Morning America, and CBS' now-defunct The Early Show. In other countries, the format was copied – most notably in the United Kingdom with the BBC's Breakfast Time and TV-am's Good Morning Britain, and in Canada with Canada AM on CTV.  Mascot J. Fred Muggs and companion with Garroway, 1954  The set in January 1952  Broadcast schedule [ edit ]  When Today debuted, it was seen live only in the Eastern and Central time zones, broadcasting for three hours each morning but seen for only two hours in each time zone. Since 1958, Today has been tape-delayed for the five other U.S. time zones (Central, Mountain, Pacific, Alaska and Hawaii–Aleutian). Partly to accommodate host Dave Garroway's declining health, the program ceased live broadcasts in the summer of 1958, opting instead to broadcast an edition taped the previous afternoon. The experiment, which drew criticism from many sides, ended when John Chancellor replaced Garroway in July 1961.[8]  Today was a two-hour program for many years, airing from 7:00 a.m. - 9:00 a.m. in all time zones except for Alaska, Hawaii, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, until NBC expanded the program to three hours (extending the program until 10:00 a.m.) on October 2, 2000. A fourth hour (which extended the program until 11:00 a.m.) was eventually added on September 10, 2007. NBC stations in some markets, such as WYFF in Greenville, South Carolina, air the third and fourth hours of Today on tape delay.  In August 2013, Today released a mobile app for smartphones and tablets.[9]  Weekday showtimes and local cut-ins [ edit ]  Generally, the program airs "	1
"Kristen Stewart made a statement on the Cannes red carpet on Monday night, removing her heels seemingly in protest at the strict dress code.  The Cannes red carpet has become infamous in recent years for its high heels only policy, with actresses speaking out against it.  Ms Stewart kicked off her black Louboutins on the ""BlacKkKlansman"", turning heads and causing some to wonder whether it was done as a show against the footwear rule.  After taking off her shoes on the red carpet in front of photographers, she proceeded to climb the stairs barefoot.  It does not appear she was sanctioned for her rebellious act - although she took them off, she did wear her high heels for part of the red carpet and was photographed in them.  The controversial dress code caused many to speak out in fury in 2015 after a group of women wearing flat shoes were reportedly turned away from seeing a screening of Carol."	1

It’s a well-known fashion idiom that shoes and a handbag are the cornerstone to any good ensemble. Ask any fashion industry veteran and they will tell you that when they started out (and couldn’t afford a wardrobe full of designer threads), they trusted a great bag and a classic pair of designer heels to elevate their outfits.  Celebrities have it slightly easier – working with multi-million dollar salaries they can afford to swap out handbags on a day-to-day basis. But they don’t. Just like their approach to footwear, there are a handful of handbag styles that celebrities wear on high rotation. And we’re not talking classic classics like the Hermès Birkin or the Chanel 2.55.  Here are eight handbags that celebrities love.  From: Harper’s BAZAAR AU	1
FX is not going forward with its Marvel’s Deadpool animated adult action-comedy series, from Atlanta creator/executive producer/star Donald Glover and writer Stephen Glover. The project, an adaptation of the hit Marvel character, received a 10-episode straight-to-series order last May to premiere in 2018 on FX Networks’ comedy-focused FXX.  Primetime-Panic Your Complete Guide to Pilots and Straight-to-Series orders See All  “Due to creative differences, FX, Donald Glover, Stephen Glover and Marvel Television have agreed to part ways on Marvel’s Deadpool animated series,” the network said in a statement Saturday. “FX will no longer be involved with the project. FX and Marvel have an ongoing relationship through our partnership on Legion, which will continue.”  FX’s other collaboration with Marvel TV, live-action drama series Legion, is heading into its second season, which debuts April 3.  According to sources, Marvel did not agree with the Glovers’ vision for the show based on scripts written by Stephen Glover. FX supported the brothers, who have overall deals at FX Prods., so FX, with Donald and Stephen Glover, pulled out from the project. (Donald Glover and his brother Stephen were attached as showrunners, executive producers and writers of the Deadpool animated series).  The untitled Marvel’s Deadpool series was to be produced by Marvel TV in association with FX Productions and ABC Signature Studios. It is unclear yet whether Marvel TV and ABC Studios will continue to pursue the project. The rights to the Deadpool character are owned by Fox — the Deadpool live-action movie, starring Ryan Reynolds became one of Fox’s highest-grossing movies of all time — so at the moment, until the pending Disney acquisition of Fox assets is completed, a Deadpool TV series has to be done with another Fox production entity. Aside from FX Prods., there is only one other Fox TV studio — 20th Century Fox TV.  In 2016, FX Networks topper John Landgraf signaled a programming shift for the younger-skewing FXX with an emphasis on animation. FXX already has The Simpsons library, and FX hit Archer migrated to FXX with its eighth season. The goal had been to launch a new FXX animated series behind Season 9 of Archer in 2018, with Marvel’s Deadpool considered a strong contender.  Since his debut in 1991, Deadpool has grown to become one of Marvel’s most popular characters. The Deadpool movie earned $783 million worldwide. Its sequel hits theaters May 18.  Donald Glover has been very busy over the past year. In addition to the critically praised Atlanta, which recently returned for a second season after a lengthy hiatus, he has the Han Solo movie coming up as well as the animated The Lion King. He also earned a slew of Grammy nominations for his alter ego Childish Gambino.	1
"The Sex and the City star and her actor husband are ""overjoyed"" at the prospect of becoming parents again, according to their publicists.  The couple, who married in 1997, has a six-year-old son, James Wilkie Broderick.  US celebrity news website Entertainment Weekly quoted ""a friend"" of the couple who said they had been trying to have more children for years but had been unsuccessful.  ""They came to the conclusion that this was going to be the best alternative for expanding their family,"" the friend said.  ""They are over the moon as any prospective parents would be. Their life is about to get a lot busier.""  The couple reportedly turned to surrogacy last year. They refused to name the woman who will be carrying the twins.  Parker, 44, is currently filming Did You Hear About the Morgans?, a romantic comedy with Hugh Grant. Broderick, 47, is starring on Broadway in the play The Philanthropist.  The Sex and the City sequel is expected to be released in 2010."	0
"The lavish, sentimental and bizarre gifts showered upon the Royal Family in 2017 have been revealed in an official list published today.  It details a rugby ball received by the Duchess of Cambridge during her trip to Paris, a hamper of local produce given to Prince Charles and Camilla at the Vatican, and a picture received by Prince Harry - of himself.  The Duke of Cambridge was also gifted an apron to pass on to his brother and his soon-to-be sister-in-law, Meghan Markle, as well as miniature chef outfits for Prince George and Princess Charlotte.  The young royals were also seen being handed a selection of gifts during their trip to Germany last July.

Charles and Camilla were also lavished with jewels from the Sultan of Brunei last November.

'I couldn't get anyone—even the people who loved me the most, even my boyfriend or my mother or my father—to understand what that experience was truly like for me,' she added.

It’s not the exact events, but what I wanted to do with the film was get the audience to understand what it sounds like and what it feels like to be struggling with that illness.'  'It’s not a disease you can see, you just hear something in your head that tells you not to eat — for many, many different reasons for different people.'

"There are many reasons to love Leslie Jones: her love for tweeting about the Olympics and Game of Thrones, her acting in hilarious sketches on Saturday Night Live, and her unabashed support for women of all shapes and sizes. The comedian showed off the latter, along with her flair for the dramatic, last night at the Time 100 Gala in an epic tribute to another Jones: Grace Jones, iconic supermodel known for envelope-pushing androgynous looks. Wearing a show-stopping white double-breasted tuxedo dress with a high hemline and even higher shoulder pads, Jones completed the transformation with black cat-eye sunglasses, navy lipstick, and the supermodel's signature flattop haircut.  The dress was a custom look created by Christian Siriano, who was one of the event's honorees. Siriano and Jones formed a close working relationship after the SNL cast member tweeted that no designers would dress her for the premiere of Ghostbusters. Less than one day later, Siriano reached out and the duo began creating a custom, red, off-the-shoulder ballgown with major Vivian from Pretty Woman vibes. ""It takes a real designer to design for a real woman,"" Jones said at the time, adding, ""I feel amazing. Christian hooked me up! Christian Siriano hooked me up.""  Jones seemed to know that her splashy tribute would be a hit. After the event, she took to Instagram to post her look. ""So did I pull it off or what??,"" she captioned a picture. ""'Pull up to the Bumper' bitches!! #gracejonesismyidol."" She also posted a hilarious picture with Siriano at the event. ""Ok this was my favorite pic of the night!! Loved being your date So much fucking fun @csiriano! Congrats on becoming Time 100!!"" Jones also praised Jennifer Lopez and Shaun Mendes for their performances, but ultimately just wanted to pay tribute to her idol. ""And I got to look like Grace Jones!! I hope she saw it!!""

And that they are enough to change things.”  Farrow, now 32, sat down with “This Morning” co-host Gayle King on Monday to discuss the alleged abuse, which she claims happened in an attic in 1992 when she was just 7 years old.  The interview isn’t scheduled to air until Thursday, but CBS released a short preview online Tuesday.  Farrow has never given an interview on camera about the accusations against her adoptive father — which he has repeatedly denied — nor has she spoken about the #MeToo and “Time’s Up” movements that have taken Hollywood by storm recently. She is expected to talk about both during the sit-down.  While numerous stars have denounced Allen in light of what’s going on in the country, several have chosen to stick by his side.  Alec Baldwin defended the scandal-plagued director on Twitter this week, saying: “Woody Allen was investigated forensically by two states (NY and CT) and no charges were filed…The renunciation of him and his work, no doubt, has some purpose. But it’s unfair and sad to me. I worked w WA 3 times and it was one of the privileges of my career.”  Selena Gomez’s mother, Mandy Teefey, described the star’s support for Allen while responding to a fan on Instagram.  “I had a long talk with her about not working with him and it didn’t click,” she said. “There is no fall person here. No one controls her. She makes all her own decisions. No matter how hard you try to advise. It falls on deaf ears.”	1

Diet Coke debuted four new flavors on Wednesday in an attempt to turn around the struggling beverage’s sales.  Two of the flavors were disappointing as gimmicky stunts failing to live up to the original’s excellence.  However, the other two demonstrate a possible path toward salvation for Diet Coke.  Diet Coke is undergoing some massive changes, including some surprising new flavors.  On Wednesday, Coca-Cola announced it is rolling out four new flavors: Ginger Lime, Feisty Cherry, Zesty Blood Orange, and Twisted Mango. The new flavors are accompanied by modernized Diet Coke packaging and a new ad campaign.  For the last few years, Diet Coke has been the weakest link in the company’s cola lineup. In October, Coca-Cola reported the brand’s sales by volume declined in the mid-single digits last quarter. Industry publication Beverage Digest reported Diet Coke US sales by the dollar dropped 1.9% in 2016.  Coca-Cola said in a press release it spent two years developing the new flavors and bottles, testing more than 30 new Diet Coke flavors.  We had the chance to taste test the feisty flavors and see if Coca-Cola’s two-year project was time well spent.  The Twisted Mango is the most bizarre new flavor — and the worst. While it tastes strongly of an unplaceable fruit upon first sip, the flavor quickly fades to that of Wrigley gum. Basically, drinking this is like chomping on a stick of gum while chugging Diet Coke.

The “blood orange” flavor tastes like simple orange soda, meaning this drink tastes pretty much like someone got a little too creative at the soda fountain. Pass.  Foto: source Hollis Johnson  Coca-Cola has better luck with less absurd options. Feisty Cherry is the most conventional new flavor. If you like Cherry Coke and Diet Coke, you’ll like this one. We don’t know what is “feisty” about it, but it’s quite good.  Foto: source Hollis Johnson  The one Diet Coke that is both intriguing in concept and follows through with an actually tasty drink is the Ginger Lime. Fans of Coca-Cola with lime will appreciate the drink, which is accompanied by a nice snap of ginger flavor.  Foto: source Hollis Johnson  Coca-Cola isn’t changing the classic Diet Coke recipe. With the new flavors, however, the company hopes to manage the best of both worlds — avoiding the fury of loyalists while making some necessary changes to finally grow Diet Coke’s sales. And, while we don’t expect Zesty Blood Orange to catch on, flavors like Feisty Cherry seem like a step in the right direction.  Foto: source Hollis Johnson	1
"The Oscar-winning actress talks to the legendary interviewer about everything from pay equity (""I had it up to my f—ing eyeballs"") to her dealings with Harvey (""He had only been nice to me — except for when he wasn't"") to where she sees herself in 20 years: ""I won't have periods anymore, that's a bonus.""  Oprah Winfrey barely knew Jennifer Lawrence when the actress called and said she'd like to meet and then on Oct. 5 drove to see Winfrey at her Montecito, California, home. ""I was excited to have lunch, and we were just like 'girls in the garden,'"" says Winfrey. ""We probably talked for three and a half hours about life and fame and growing up and money and management and taking care of yourself and spirituality and philosophy. We drank rosé, and we laughed, and we talked about everything.""  Almost everything. One thing they didn't discuss was Harvey Weinstein, whose history of harassment and assault exploded into view that day, when The New York Times first detailed it. But Weinstein became a focal point of the two women's conversation a few weeks later, when THR asked Winfrey, 63, to interview Lawrence for this Women in Entertainment issue. That was shortly before the 27-year-old actress was to receive the Sherry Lansing Leadership Award at THR's annual Power 100 breakfast, an award Winfrey received in 2013.  Since their first meeting, the new friends have been texting back and forth. ""I sent her a copy of Wisdom of Sundays and, before that, Power of Now and A New Earth,"" notes Winfrey. ""What resonates with me is that, when you are talking to her, what you're seeing is the real thing. You're not seeing any pretense. She's asking all the right questions: 'How can I be used? How can I use this moment for something bigger than myself?'""  Lawrence grew up in Louisville, Kentucky, and was propelled to fame with 2010's Winter's Bone. The Hunger Games made her a global superstar, along with roles in Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle and the X-Men series. But it's not so much her stardom and four Oscar nominations (with a win for Silver Linings) that make her the perfect recipient of the Lansing award; it's also her nonprofit endeavors. She's been tireless in supporting Kentucky charities and those that help children in particular.  That's one reason why Winfrey was so impressed by ""how much light [Lawrence] carries. Capital L, capital Light. You can feel there's a strong intelligence and a desire to use this moment for something greater than fame and fortune.""  OPRAH WINFREY I read this wonderful book by Elizabeth Strout [Anything Is Possible]. And in it, she was speaking about one of the characters who was so embittered and regretful, and the line she used was, ""because her life did not turn out the way she had expected."" Is your life what you expected?  JENNIFER LAWRENCE When I started acting, I was totally satisfied when I was on a sitcom because I had a steady paycheck. And I was like, ""Maybe I can just find a way to be on sitcoms forever."" I was totally satisfied and good. I never dreamed that I could have this kind of career.  When you dreamed the dream, what did the dream look like? I used to drive home from church with my father past rich white people's houses — we'd be the last to leave our little church yard, and he'd be in this big, old, green Oldsmobile that I was embarrassed to be in — and I'd pick houses that I dreamed about living in, and that was a big dream for me: I'd have a house, I'd be able to pay my bills, I'd have two cars in the driveway.  I used to do that, too. I remember driving by big, beautiful houses, but I always dreamed of being there with my parents. I never imagined I'd be able to own something like that on my own. I thought for a while maybe I could be an interior designer — that was the only job I knew about because my mom was friends with an interior designer. I was mostly just focused on a family when I was little. I would have never thought I'd be so career-focused. It's not something I "	1

Oh, no! Are Kim Kardashian and Kanye West headed for splitsville? A new report claims that there is definitely trouble in paradise, and the couple are even sleeping in different beds.  Kim Kardashian, 35, could be preparing to divorce for a third time. After her husband, Kanye West, 38, had a number of different outbursts on social media, a new report says that Kim — and her family — have had enough and are ready to cut the cord. Yikes!  “Kim is at a loss,” a family insider shared with OK! Magazine inside their March 21 issue. Of course, the insider is talking about Kim’s relationship with Kanye, and how it’s allegedly falling apart at the seams due to his reckless behavior on social media and at Saturday Night Live. “She’s questioning the relationship for the first time.” So sad. To hear more about Kanye West, head over to iTunes and download the latest HollywoodLife podcast for free!  Unfortunately, the report claims that there is more to the story than just Kanye’s incessant Twitter rants. Apparently, the couple are “in a rut” that has caused them to lose “the spark” they once shared. “He let himself go while he was working on his album and clothing line, so he’s flabby and irritable. Meanwhile, she’s struggling to lose the baby weight and find her confidence again too.” The insider says these issues have led them to sleeping in different rooms when they are together.  Ever since Kanye started going off on everyone from Taylor Swift to Wiz Khalifa on social media, there seem to be a lot of concerns about the state of his relationship with Kim. Even worse? It’s previously been reported that Kim’s momager, Kris Jenner, is extremely concerned that he could potentially destroy the Kardashian/Jenner empire she’s built. Eek.  But, the report claims that Kim hasn’t completely given up hope. The mother-of-two reportedly asked her hubby to join her for a gym session or two, but Kanye hasn’t been interested in the bonding experience. “He’s knee-deep in work right now,” the insider explained in Kanye’s defense.  Kanye hasn’t given up, either. Not only did he support Kim’s recent nude Instagram despite all of the controversy surrounding it, he gushed over how she was his “muse” on Twitter and also shared that he couldn’t wait to get home to her and their two sweet children once he was done designing in Sweden. There’s hope for these two yet!  Tell us, HollywoodLifers — Are you concerned that the end of Kimye is near? Comment below with your thoughts.	0
"Brad Pitt, accused of child abuse, is under investigation  Brad Pitt is being investigated after being accused of verbal and physical abuse against his children.  Los Angeles County Department of Children and Family Services spokesman Armand Montiel told USA TODAY by law the agency cannot confirm or deny investigations.  But a source close to Pitt, who was not authorized to speak publicly, told USA TODAY that Pitt is taking this matter ""very seriously and is fully cooperating.""  ""The claims are greatly exaggerated or fabricated,"" the source said. ""But he’ll always do whatever is best for his kids. Despite being on the receiving end of an onslaught of allegations, he remains focused on doing whatever is best for the children.”  TMZ reports the actor, whose wife Angelina Jolie filed for divorce Monday, is under investigation following an incident on a private jet.  TMZ says the case was referred over to the FBI on Thursday due to the fact that the alleged incident happened in the air while the family was on a plane from France last Wednesday.  “The FBI is continuing to gather facts and will evaluate whether an investigation at the federal level will be pursued,” FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said in a statement emailed to USA TODAY.  In divorce documents, Jolie listed the couple's date of separation as the following day, Sept. 15.  People.com reports that Pitt is accused of getting verbally abusive with one of couple's kids, as well as getting physical while the family was on their private plane. People and TMZ both note that Jolie and at least some of the couple's other children were present at the time. Pitt and Jolie have six children: Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 8.  The Los Angeles Police Department is so far not investigating. ""LAPD is not handling any report or allegations into child abuse against Brad Pitt,"" spokeswoman Officer Jenny Houser told USA TODAY in a statement on Thursday.  Attempts to reach Jolie's representative were not successful.  Contributing: Maria Puente, Andrea Mandell"	0

NEW YORK (Reuters) - Ryan Seacrest confirmed on Thursday that he will return as host of “American Idol,” the most popular music reality show in U.S. television history, when it comes back to the screen on ABC TV in 2018.  After much anticipation and speculation, Seacrest, who served as host of the talent competition show during its initial 15-season run that ended in April 2016, confirmed the news on “Live with Kelly and Ryan” Thursday morning.  “Is it OK if I announce this big news?” talk show host Kelly Ripa asked Seacrest, who was seated next to her. “I’ve been waiting and waiting.”  With a nod from Seacrest, Ripa said, “We’ve been talking about it for a little while, but I am happy to confirm ... that Ryan Seacrest is returning as the host of ‘American Idol,’” prompting cheers from the studio audience.  Seacrest has co-hosted ABC’s morning talk show with Ripa since May.  The radio and TV personality, who will continue to host “Live with Kelly and Ryan” from New York, said he was “very, very excited” about reprising his “American Idol” duties. He will also remain as host and executive producer of his syndicated radio program “On Air With Ryan Seacrest” from Los Angeles.  “It’s genuinely hard to put into words what ‘American Idol’ means to me,” Seacrest, 42, said in a statement. “I’m so grateful for the show and all the career and life opportunities it’s allowed me to experience.”  The show, which was canceled by Fox Television last year, was once a ratings powerhouse, watched by more than 30 million viewers at its peak in 2005-2007.  The glitzy talent show that launched the careers of Kelly Clarkson, Adam Lambert, Jennifer Hudson and others - spiced with celebrity judges who alternately feuded and fawned - eventually fell victim to declining ratings.  FILE PHOTO: Show host Ryan Seacrest addresses the audience during the American Idol Grand Finale in Hollywood, California April 7, 2016. REUTERS/Mario Anzuoni/File Photo  Within the United States, the “American Idol” phenomenon spawned a host of competing shows such as NBC’s “The Voice,” CBS’s “Rock Star”, and Fox’s “The X Factor.”  Pop star Katy Perry, who is set to judge the next generation of artists on the show, took to Twitter to express her excitement about the news and sing the praises of Seacrest.  “I’m spicy, @RyanSeacrest is seasoned!” wrote Perry. “All the right ingredients are coming together on @AmericanIdol.”	1
On Sunday, BuzzFeed News reported that Anthony Rapp, an actor, said Mr. Spacey had made a sexual advance toward him in 1986, when Mr. Rapp was 14. He said that Mr. Spacey, who was then 26, had picked him up, placed him on a bed and climbed on top of him.  Mr. Spacey did not offer a comment to BuzzFeed. But shortly after the story was published, he released a statement in which he said he did not recall the encounter. “But if I did behave then as he describes, I owe him the sincerest apology for what would have been deeply inappropriate drunken behavior,” he said in the statement.  The accusation “has encouraged me to address other things about my life,” he continued in the statement. He then publicly divulged for the first time that he had “loved and had romantic encounters with men throughout my life.”	1
Joining SnapLight in its suit is Hooshmand Harooni, who maintains he patented the technology in 2013. In the court papers, Harooni describes the product as an “integrated lighting accessory and case for a mobile phone device.” Harooni and SnapLight claim Kardashian’s company Kimsaprincess, Inc. is also liable because she gets a cut of the profits from LuMee, who they allege stole their technology.  Kim Kardashian is being sued by a company that offers illuminated cellphone cases to help take well-lit selfies, like the ones the reality star often flaunts on social media. Also named in the $100 million lawsuit filed on Monday is LuMee Technology, the makers of the smartphone cases that Kardashian uses and often promotes. Kardashian is mostly included in the suit for promoting and profiting from the sales of LuMee.  Kardashian promotes LuMee a lot. In February, for example, she tweeted a photo of herself holding a mobile device, with the caption, “Lumee Duo! It launched in Apple stores & has lights on front & the back so u can take insane pics! It’s a softer case now too #LumeeCollab.” The following month, she tweeted another shot of herself on her phone and exclaimed, “This is happening! The Lumee Black Duo is now in Apple Globally -Loving the back light! #lumeecollab.”  She similarly noted on Twitter in April, while taking a selfie, “White Lumee Duo In Apple stores worldwide #LumeeCollab.” And the Instagram photo above was her promoting an earlier version of LuMee in July 2016, with a link to Amazon and a caption that read, “Hey Guys! LuMee cases are featured today as Amazon’s Prime Deal of the Day. Best deal ever! #PrimeDay #LuMee.”  After meeting and taking a selfie with then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at a fundraiser, Kardashian used the encounter to later promote LuMee. In fact, when Clinton was asked in January 2016 on the “Ellen Degeneres Show” about taking a selfie with Kardashian, the Democratic presidential nominee recalled, “She takes out her phone and she presses a button. I’ve never seen this anywhere else… it has lights all the way around it. Like little tiny, tiny light bulbs.”  DeGeneres acknowledged, “I saw [Kardashian’s] phone… It makes you look better,” to which Clinton added, “I have been desperately looking for one of those ever since with no luck!” And right after that, Kardashian tweeted, “Selfies about to be LIT!!! The secret to my selfies http://Lumee.com.” Gossip Cop has reached to SnapLight, LuMee, and Harooni for comment. A rep for Kardashian tells us, “The patent lawsuit filed by SnapLight has no merit and is just another attempted shakedown. Kim has done absolutely nothing wrong.”  Photo: AOL	0
"Kate Middleton has made it her mission to help pregnant moms everywhere and recently showed interest in one illness that plagues many expectant mothers - postpartum depression.  On Wednesday, the Duchess of Cambridge visited the Maurice Wohl Clinical Neuroscience Institute at King's College London. Middleton toured the institute and talked to the doctors about the different challenges in dealing with maternal mental health like postpartum depression, biological factors affecting the mother's mental health and the support available for new moms, E! News reported.  ""She was interested in the fact that we look at the whole range of issues including PTSD and self-harm,"" said Professor Louise Howard, who teaches women's mental health. ""She was interested in understanding the whole breadth of the issues and how to make people more robust.""  Aside from helping women with postpartum depression, the institute is also working on a new treatment to help those suffering from Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, schizophrenia and epilepsy. There was a short lighthearted moment when the professionals talked about using an avatar to aid individuals with schizophrenia deal with hearing loss.  ""As in the movie 'Avatar'?"" Middleton asked. However, the Duchess was told that the avatar is not similar to the ones shown in James Cameron's film in 2009.  Middleton is an active advocate of mental health. The royal mom-of-two is promoting the same advocacy for mothers. In November, Prince William's wife hosted a roundtable discussion on maternal mental health.  During the gathering, Middleton met with experts from Maternal Mental Health Alliance, Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families and Royal College of Obstetricians & Gynaecologists. They talked about the different issues surrounding maternal mental health.  In related news during Middleton's recent engagement, the expectant mom donned a baby blue coat. On Tuesday, she also stepped out wearing a blue dress with matching blue scarf, shoes and jewelry. Many interpreted Middleton's choice of color as a hint that she is having a baby boy.  However, it is difficult to tell if the duchess is really making a statement when it comes to the shade of her dresses because she wore pink when she visited Coventry with Prince William last week. But, Middleton is spotted more often wearing blue dresses.  In related news, the betting for the name of Prince William and Middleton's third royal baby has already started. The leading name is Alice while the runner-up is Albert."	1
Kourtney Kardashian may be 14 years older than her boyfriend.  But the reality star still believes that the 15 year age difference between her ex Scott Disick and his current girlfriend Sofia Richie is way too much.  The 39-year-old eldest Kardashian sister sill thinks the 19-year-old model is still 'too young' for her 34-year-old ex according to a source for People on Monday.  Not over it: Kourtney Kardashian thinks ex Scott Disick's new girlfriend is still 'too young' for him according to a Monday report from People  Mind the gap: The 39-year-old eldest Kardashian sister sill thinks the age gap between 34-year-old Scott and 19-year-old model Sofia Richie is still too much according to an insider, as they are pictured together in Miami back in December  Things seem to be getting serious between Scott and Sofia as they have been spotted together with his three children with Kourtney recently.  Despite the age gap, the insider insists that Sofia has had a good influence on Scott and his children: sons Mason, eight, and Reign, three, and five-year-old daughter Penelope.  'Sofia is helping Scott be a better, healthier person,' the source said. 'Kourtney feels confident that Scott and Sofia takes good care of the kids. Scott is a great dad when he has his life together.'  Family fun: Things seem to be getting serious between Scott and Sofia as they have been spotted together with his three children with Kourtney recently, as they are pictured together in Malibu last month  Just us: Scott and Sofia have been dating officially since September, as they are pictured together in Miami back in December  This is a drastic change to earlier this year when a source said of Kourtney: 'Like most people, she thinks Sofia is way too young for him and doesn’t get it.'  Meanwhile Kourtney is dating model Younes Bendjima who at 25-years-old is 14 years her junior.  This comes just weeks after Disick found public interest in his love life to be 'flattering' and that he takes the attention people pay to his personal life as a compliment.  He explained: 'I guess it's kind of flattering that people care. 'It's not like I'm mad about it. Everybody's worried about something. Everybody is worried about other people's things, so it's fine.'  Moving on: Meanwhile Kourtney is dating model Younes Bendjima who at 25-years-old is 14 years her junior, as they are pictured together in Beverly Hills on Saturday  Scott - who recently bonded with his eldest child, Mason, during a week-long trip to Cleveland - shares custody of his three children with Kourtney.  But the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star insisted he doesn't harbor any fears about his kids.  Speaking to People, Scott shared: 'I don't worry about them, they're unbelievable. Best kids in the world.'  Despite this, an insider recently claimed that Sofia is fed up with Scott obsessing about his ex.  The celebrity duo have been dating since May last year, but it was suggested that Sofia is frustrated that the reality TV star appears to be so concerned with Kourtney.  The source explained: 'Sofia is annoyed with Scott's obsession with his ex Kourtney.'  In particular, the teenage star - who is the daughter of music icon Lionel Richie - has grown bored of having to listen to Scott complain about Kourtney's romance with Younes Bendjima.  The insider said: 'She's tired of listening to Scott complain about Kourtney and Sofia really doesn't like to hear Scott whine about Younes taking his place.'  It was suggested that Sofia is close to ending their relationship over the issue. The source added: 'For Sofia, it's a real turn-off when Scott stalks Kourtney online and obsesses about her, there is only so much more Sofia can take.'	0
In her book The Journalist and the Murderer , Janet Malcolm wrote something that shocked and angered people. In her eyes, the objective analysis of evidence to determine a person’s guilt or innocence is an utterly futile endeavour. “It is like looking for proof or disproof of the existence of God in a flower,” she wrote. “It all depends on how you read the evidence. If you start out with a presumption of his guilt, you read the documents one way, and another way if you presume his innocence. The material does not ‘speak for itself’.”  The same goes for reading people: the presumption of guilt will load the person’s words, tone, expressions and actions with strangeness and darkness, the presumption of innocence will vindicate them. Objectivity is impossible.  It’s also boring.  I am no bystander in the wave of true crime dramas that have crashed into popular culture in recent times: from Sarah Koenig’s Serial podcast, to Andrew Jarecki’s HBO series The Jinx, and now, Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos’s Netflix show Making A Murderer. I have prayed for Adnan Syed’s innocence, I have sworn my certainty of Robert Durst’s burping guilt, I have taped a picture of Dean Strang inside the locker of my heart. I love these shows for their strangeness, for their sheer spectacle, and for the thrill each time new and crazier evidence comes to light, confirming my insightful suspicions.  The makers of Serial, The Jinx, and Making a Murderer would all declare their purposes were twofold: to make an entertaining programme, and to find the truth. If finding the truth necessitates remaining objective, I’m not sure to what extent these aims are compatible.  Real life crime stories have long been treated as entertainment: from eighteenth-century tabloids to In Cold Blood to The Thin Blue Line. Take, for example, the early twentieth century magazine, True Detective, which splashed sensational stories across its covers like “The Riddle of Oregon’s Dismembered Brunette”, and spawned giants of the genre like Dashiell Hammett, Jim Thompson, and Ann Rule. Serial, The Jinx and Making a Murderer do show how far the genre has developed since then, but they also share some key similarities. They all concern the violent deaths of beautiful young women, they all suggest that the police were incompetent in securing justice for that woman’s death, and they all invite the audience to retrace the gory details of her killing (perhaps in order to “save” her by ensuring her real killer is punished).  This is just one of the immediate ways in which true crime can be ethically tricky. Do we want to know every gory detail of these crimes because we care about the victim, or because it excites us? Do we crane our necks at grieving parents for our own entertainment? Is it inherently unethical to treat real lives as spectacle? Aside from general distastefulness, what practical impact does taking evidence out of the courtroom, and into the laps of a potentially limitless audience, have over a case? What are the benefits, and the dangers, of deciding that the law is wrong? These questions are easily asked, and difficult to answer.  If, as Malcolm argues, our reading of a case is utterly dependent on our own presumptions, what do true crime programmes presume? Overtly or not, the ultimate goal of these programmes is to set out to contradict the current narrative surrounding these cases. On the latest series of Serial, Sarah Koenig says, “I don’t think the state’s story is the correct story.” That’s a provocative, rebellious, exciting statement. The most interesting conclusions is not, “We can never know for certain, and on balance, we agree with what the state decided at the time.” For better or worse, these programmes do begin with a presumption before they read the evidence, and the presumption is that the dominant narrative is wrong.  As its title suggests, Making a Murderer is in many ways a story about storytelling: it argues that the state, and contemporary media, fabric	1

"The 2018 Grammys, the 60th installment of the music industry’s flagship awards show, were handed out on Sunday night. And the night belonged to Bruno Mars.  Heading into the awards, Mars and Jay-Z led the nominations. But Mars ultimately swept the three biggest honors of the night, taking home Album of the Year and Record of the Year for 24k Magic and winning Song of the Year for “That’s What I Like.”  Related 3 reasons why the 2018 Grammys fell so flat  Mars won six Grammys overall. In the end, Jay-Z was completely shut out and went home empty handed.  The Grammys handed out more than 80 golden gramophones in total, including in dozens of categories whose winners were announced shortly before the live telecast. Going into the ceremony, for example, Mars had already won three Grammys: Best R&B Album for 24K Magic and Best R&B Performance and Best R&B Song for “That’s What I Like.”  Another big winner from the preshow awards was Kendrick Lamar, who won five Grammys total: He was honored with Best Rap Song, Best Rap Performance, and Best Music Video for “HUMBLE” during the preshow, and during the main ceremony, he won Best Rap/Sung Performance for “Loyalty” with Rihanna and Best Rap Album for DAMN.

Jennifer Aniston is ready for society to accept every body type — not just a “size 4.”  The actress, 49, talked about how excited she is for the Miss America pageant to eliminate the swimsuit competition this year, and the implications for body acceptance.  “I love that the Miss America pageant is going to get rid of the swimsuit competition altogether,” Aniston said in the September issue of InStyle. “You know, a swimsuit body is a body in a swimsuit, no matter what that body is.”  Aniston — who plays an ex-pageant queen in her upcoming movie, Dumplin’ — said that shaming people for their size is outdated.  “It’s time to just stop thinking beauty is in the shape of a size 4 and the right butt size and the right waist size and the right measurements,” she said. “It’s just old. We’ve done it. We’ve been there. Let’s move on.”  Jennifer Aniston More  And while Aniston is likely around a size 4 herself, she is still frequently body shamed — she had to explain in 2016 that she wasn’t pregnant, she just ate a burger, after photos of her in a bikini led to internet speculation. Aniston told InStyle that she dealt with body insecurities as a kid, too.  “I was one of the kids who the others would decide to make fun of. It was an odd period of time during fifth, sixth, seventh grades. I was a little on the chubby side, so I was just that kid,” she said. “Childhood is such a vulnerable time, and I’m sure a part of me believed all that they teased me about.”  RELATED VIDEO: Behind the Cover: Jennifer Aniston  Now, when her frustrations build up — whether it’s about body image or assumptions about her post-break up mental state — Aniston turns to boxing.  “Boxing is a great way to get aggression out. You get a mental release of all this crap you’re taking into your ears and eyes every day and have little fantasy moments imagining who you’re actually punching,” she said. “I’m just grateful it’s not actually the person, even though there’s one person. You know what I mean. It’s all good.”  Jennifer Aniston More  Aniston said that she discovered her “love” of boxing last year.  “It’s the longest workout I’ve actually stayed with consistently other than yoga,” she said. “There’s something about the mental aspect of boxing — the drills, your brain has to work, you’re not just sitting on a bike. It’s amazing.”	0

The bride’s close friend Janina Gavankar was one of 200 guests to score an invite to the bash and has since revealed some of her favourite highlights from the evening.

Speaking to Town and Country, the former True Blood star let slip a few secrets, including the adorable nod the couple paid to their homelands.

Courtney Love stars as a distressed and conflicted Kitty Menendez in the expertly melodramatic trailer for Lifetime’s upcoming original movie, Menendez: Blood Brothers. The film tells the story of Lyle and Erik Menendez, who notoriously murdered their parents in 1989. It premieres June 11th.  Along with Love, Menendez stars Nico Tortorella and Myko Olivier as brothers Lyle and Erik, and Benito Martinez as the family patriarch, Jose Menendez. The new trailer highlights the abuse Jose inflicted upon his sons, as well as Kitty’s inability to protect her sons or stop her husband. In quintessential Lifetime movie fashion, the trailer boasts a scene in which Kitty looks nervously into a mirror in a dark room while whispering in a voice over, “Just get through this day Kitty, tomorrow will be different.”  Elsewhere in the clip, the Menendez brothers plot and carry out their parents’ murder and enjoy a surprise respite of freedom before the swift hammer of justice comes down – which of course prompts some furious telephone smashing in a seedy motel room.  The Menendez brothers’ trial became became a national sensation as the brothers testified about their father’s history of abuse. After a deadlocked jury and mistrial, Erik and Lyle were retried and convicted on two counts of first-degree murder. In 1996, they were sentenced to life without parole, and are currently serving time in separate prisons.  Along with Lifetime’s Menendez: Blood Brothers, Law & Order creator Dick Wolf is working on a true crime spin-off of his hit series that will debut with an eight-episode first season about the Menendez brothers.	1
One month after Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s royal wedding, the Duchess’ beloved father, Thomas Markle, is finally speaking out.  In a tell-all interview with Good Morning Britain, the Mexico resident opened up about his relationship with Prince Harry, his staged photo scandal, his heart condition and his biggest regrets after missing his daughter’s special day.  To start off the talk, Pierce Morgan asked Thomas, 73, how he felt when Meghan, 36, told him she was dating Harry, 33.  “Well of course it’s ‘wow’, it comes out as a ‘wow’ but you know this is my daughter. My daughter’s certainly, certainly a prize for him as well,” said Thomas.  PHOTOS: Life Of A Princess: Meghan Markle’s Never-Before Seen Childhood Photos Exposed!  “Yeah he’s great, he’s an interesting guy, he’s a prince, but my daughter’s been a princess since the day she was born,” he sweetly added.  Meghan’s dad then admitted that he’s yet to meet Harry in person, but the two have shared various stimulating phone conversations over the past year.  “It’s always been over the phone,” he explained. “We have yet to see each other face to face. We’ve had interesting conversations on the phone. He’s a smart guy.”  PHOTOS: So Naughty! Prince Harry’s Cross-Dressing Scandal EXPOSED  “We talked a few times about Donald Trump and Brexit, things like that, and he’s an interesting guy,” Thomas continued. “I was complaining I didn’t like Donald Trump, he said ‘give Donald Trump a chance.’ I sort of disagreed with that, but I still like Harry. That was his politics, I have my politics.” Thomas also touched on Harry’s views about Brexit, saying the Prince seemed “open to the experiment.”  When asked about his first phone conversation with Harry, Thomas claimed it was all very casual and friendly.  “He said ‘Hello Thomas’ and I said ‘Hi Harry’ and it became a conversation back and forth mostly about politics. He was asking me how I was feeling that day and I was telling him how unhappy I was with the President,” Thomas explained.  “We talked a little bit about how they met and how happy they were with each other, and that was pretty much it for the first conversation.”  The GMB host then asked Thomas at what point he knew Meghan would end up marrying the British monarch, and did he believe it was the right choice to wed the royal after her failed first marriage?  PHOTOS: U.S. Sweetheart To Princess! Peek Inside Meghan Markle’s Childhood Photo Album  “My daughter’s very intelligent. She knows how to choose who she wants to be with. She’s a smart girl, and she made a good pick, didn’t she?” joked Thomas.  He then confirmed that Harry did in fact ask for his daughter’s hand in marriage during one of their phone conversations.  “Meghan told me first, then a few times after that Harry got on the phone with Meghan, they called me together. Harry asked for her hand over the phone. I said, ‘you’re a gentleman, promise me you’ll never raise your hand against my daughter, and of course I give you my permission.’”  Thomas later explained that he “had no idea” how much Meghan’s new royal status would impact him and his entire family, but admitted that he will eventually get used to it.  “Having the press at my door and everywhere I go, yeah that kind of became an invasion a little bit,” he said, adding that although his other family members are “somewhat disturbed,” he feels that the attention is a “compliment.”  PHOTOS: Look Away, Harry! Cheeky Meghan Markle Bares Her Buns With Another Man  “My daughter is now seen all over the world as a Duchess, and I’m very proud of her, and I’ll adjust to this. I’ll get over this,” stated Thomas.  Speaking to Piers Morgan about Meghan’s new royal rules and guidelines, Thomas claimed he didn’t know how much she’d have to change her lifestyle to fit into Harry’s—and neither did the former actress!  “At the time I didn’t realize that. I’m not sure she even realized that. I’m sure it’s very complicated. They royals… they’re very complicated and it’s a w	0
"If there's one thing Vicki Gunvalson would really love to do, it's move on from talking about her controversial ex-boyfriend, Brooks Ayers. However, that topic came up once again on Monday's Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen when The Real Housewives of Orange County OG stopped by to chat about the new season. And she had a very emotional response when a caller asked about her current feelings for Brooks.  ""Why doesn't anybody talk about Donn? I was married to Donn for 20 years. I dated Brooks for 4 and a half. It's like, come on. We weren't engaged, we weren't married, it was a boyfriend for a limited bit of my time. There is no status with Brooks,"" she said. ""He has moved on; he's in Indiana. I guess he's in Indiana.""  She did, however, relay the message she would have for him should he be watching. ""'Why did you lie to me? When are you going to pay me back my money?' That's what I want to know,"" she said, before adding, ""I don't love Brooks anymore. There's no love. He was a person in my life and my past and I cared for him at that time. But, no, I don't love Brooks... Everybody move on -- he was a boyfriend; that's it.""  Vicki, clearly, gets very worked up when the subject of her ex is mentioned, which made Andy Cohen's pre-show prank on the longtime Bravoleb even more intense. ""It is very amusing when you get very wound up when we mention Brooks. Right before the show, I told Vicki that we had a huge Brooks thing that we were planning to do tonight and she went nuts,"" he shared about the prank.  You can check out Vicki every Monday at 9/8c on RHOC. Preview, below."	1

    Tell Us how you really feel! Scott Disick and Kourtney Kardashian opened up about the current state of their on-and-off relationship in a sneak peek for the Keeping Up With the Kardashians 10th Anniversary Special hosted by Ryan Seacrest and airing on Sunday, September 24. During the conversation, the self-proclaimed Lord didn’t hold back about his feelings for Kardashian, with whom he shares kids Mason, 7, Penelope, 5, and Reign, 2.  “I just want everyone to know we are just coparenting,” Disick said with a laugh. “She’s, like, the only person I’ve ever loved in my life. I still think she’s cute and stuff.”  When Seacrest asked, “Do you still hit on her?” Disick joked, “Yeah I try to f–k her like once a week.”  As previously reported, Kardashian and Disick split in 2015 after he was spotted partying with ex Chloe Bartoli. In the interview airing on Sunday, Seacrest questioned if the two could ever see themselves reconciling. “I feel like she has to say the door is closed, just to make the point,” Kourtney’s sister Kim Kardashian interjected, to which Kourtney added: “Because of the debauchery that’s gone on. The debauchery that’s gone on has definitely closed the door several, you know, billion times.”  Disick quipped: “But its been back open.”  Kardashian moved on with model Younes Bendjima in December 2016 while Disick has been linked to Sofia Richie in recent weeks.”Kourtney thinks this fling with Sofia is a little weird, but nothing shocks her anymore,” a source exclusively told Us Weekly. “Kourtney just wants Scott to be his old self. She shares three kids with him, so she’ll always want the best for him and will always make sure he’s happy.”‘  Richie’s longtime friend Bartoli is less than thrilled about the news. “After Sofia started hooking up with Scott, Chloe stopped speaking to her,” a source told Us. “It’s a mess. [They] were like sisters. They were the best of friends and were inseparable.”  For the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly’s YouTube Page.	1

    Two more grandkids to love! Beyoncé’s dad, Mathew Knowles, confirmed that the singer welcomed twins with her husband, Jay Z.  The businessman, 65, celebrated the babies’ arrival by posting a balloon-covered birthday card to Instagram on Sunday, June 18. “Happy Birthday to the twins! Love, Granddad,” the card read. Knowles captioned the post, “They’re here! #beyonce #jayz #twins #birthday #happy birthday.” (Knowles is already grandpa to Beyoncé’s 5-year-old daughter, Blue Ivy, and Solange Knowles’ 12-year-old son, Julez.)  Knowles’ confirmation, however, angered some of the BeyHive, who thought that the “Formation” singer, 35, should have been the one to announced the twins’ arrival. “Beyonce’s dad had no business telling Beyonce’s announcement. Exactly why he didn’t know she was pregnant until the Instagram post. I can’t,” one tweeter wrote.  They’re here! .⠀ .⠀ .⠀ #beyonce #jayz #twins #birthday #happybirthday A post shared by Mathew Knowles (@mrmathewknowles) on Jun 18, 2017 at 7:12am PDT  “I really hope you had Beyonce’s permission to announce this because otherwise you are so far out of line,” an Instagram commenter wrote. “It’s Beyonce’s news and if she felt ready to announce the birth she would have done it by now.”  Others defended Knowles’ post, though. “It’s completely alright if the grandfather wants to announce it,” one Instagram commenter wrote. Another Instagram user pointed out, “It could be the grandparents or the mother or the father. There’s no tradition.”  As Us Weekly previously revealed, the “Hold Up” songstress and the Tidal founder, 47, welcomed a baby boy and girl on Tuesday, June 13.  Beyoncé announced her pregnancy back in February with a flawless maternity shoot. “We would like to share our love and happiness. We have been blessed tow times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes,” she captioned an Instagram photo of herself cradling her bare baby bump.	1

    Opening up. Big Brother alum Natalie Negrotti revealed that she is pansexual and dating a woman during the Tuesday, July 17, episode of The Challenge: Final Reckoning. She also claimed that Kayleigh Morris outed her on social media following the huge fight during Vendettas, in which other women in the house threw Kaleigh’s luggage over the balcony. While Natalie claims she was not part of the “mean girls” moment, as the show phrased it, Kaleigh didn’t believe her, later calling her a “lesbian” on social media.  “She did it in a really malicious way, and that’s what really hurt me. The way she did it. She was saying, ‘She doesn’t even like d—k, she likes p—sy. She’s a lesbian.’ I’m not a lesbian, I’m pansexual,” Natalie, 28, told Us Weekly on the “Watch With Us” podcast. “She outed me in a really aggressive way and kept going. It was really homophobic in a way. To me, that’s getting gay shamed. Then there was a whole bunch of people that started gay-shaming me, calling me a ‘dyke,’ going on my social media and attacking me for being gay.”  Natalie wasn’t ready to come out – and didn’t plan on doing so on the show. In fact, she hadn’t told her family at the time of Kayleigh’s comments. Since, she has called everyone and was forced to open up about everything.  “It’s been a 28-year battle for me,” Natalie said. “I wanted to set a standard because you can’t do that. There are so many teenagers and kids that commit suicide every year because they get outed inappropriately. She took something that was mine and made it her own, and she did it really in a nasty way. Outing someone is not right and I want to set that standard … I wanted to come out in the right way, I wanted to turn it into something positive so that viewers that are going through the same thing that I’ve gone through don’t have to go through it for 28 years.”  Natalie also revealed she is in an exclusive relationship with a woman, who she describes as her “biggest supporter.” After Vendettas, Natalie and Johnny Bananas dated casually while both seeing other people. Ultimately, it just didn’t work.  The former NFL cheerleader added: “She’s a really great fit for me, and she’s really special to me.”  Listen to the podcast above to hear more about Natalie’s journey, what happened between she and Johnny, how it’s been working with Paul Calafiore and more.

"Jason Bateman received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on Wednesday, with a speech by none other than his frequent co-star and friend Jennifer Aniston.  While people were expecting Bateman's Arrested Development co-star Will Arnett to supply some laughs during his speech, many weren't expecting the amount of friendly roasting Aniston provided.  Up Next: Was the Entire 'Friends' Series Just a Dream in Rachel's Head? As E! reports, she started out going through Bateman's oft-forgotten child star beginnings, which included roles in Little House on the Prairie and The Hogan Family. She also roasted his first film role in Teen Wolf Too by showing off a Muppets Magazine cover featuring the young star.  ""One thing has proven itself to be true and that is having longevity in this business is not easy,"" Aniston said. ""Especially starting out as a child actor. Usually that's a story that doesn't always end well. When I actually met Jason it was kind of looking like it could go either way."" More: 'Ozark' Showrunner Reveals How Long He Thinks the Series Should Last  She also shared a humorous story about a New Year's ski trip she attended with Bateman that featured the Ozark star nearly crashing his car. ""Picture this: It's New Year's Eve. It's just after midnight and there is a blizzard outside. I hear someone yell, 'Help! Someone Help! Jason. Car. Someone could die.'"" Aniston recalled. ""So we run outside to help him and what we see is, we have two feet of snow, Jason is in a truck fishtailing away down a one-way street hanging with the door wide open, hanging half way out of the car. ""His foot was out trying to stop the car kind of like Fred Flintstone. It's still not clear what you were doing, a little foggy right? You don't remember. Thankfully he outgrew those days of terrifying people."""	1
Now that Katie Holmes & Jamie Foxx’s relationship has officially gone public, the two are reportedly ‘excited to have a baby!’ But is Katie already pregnant?  Looks like Katie Holmes, 39, and Jamie Foxx, 50, may be more serious than fans previously thought! While the couple had kept their relationship hidden for years, the two stepped out as a duo just last year. Since then, they’ve been spotted out and about together in public on multiple occasions — including making a big splash sitting side-by-side at Clive Davis’ pre-Grammy gala in NYC on Jan. 27. From the photos, Katie and Jamie looked happier than ever, and a new report claims that could be because they’re FINALLY on the same page about wanting to start a family together! Click here to see adorable pics of Katie Holmes with her daughter Suri Cruise.  Although it reportedly took some time for Katie to be on board, she apparently feels ready to have a baby with her new man — at least according to Life & Style magazine. “Jamie and Katie have been talking at great length about having a child together,” a source for the magazine recently told the publication. “He’s crazy about her and thinks they’ll have an adorable baby.” In fact, some witnesses at the gala last month allegedly think Katie could actually already be expecting. “At 39, Katie can feel her biological clock ticking,” the source explained. “She’s been telling friends that she doesn’t have time to waste!”  Katie is already the proud mom to 11-year-old Suri Cruise, whom she shares with ex-husband Tom Cruise, 55, and Jamie too has daughters: Corinne, 23, and Anelise, 9. But now that the two are getting more serious, they’re reportedly ready to have a baby of their own. “He told her they would make beautiful children together, and she never disagreed,” the insider said. “She’s seen what an amazing dad he is.”  On top of Jamie’s parenting skills though, he reportedly treats Katie like a “princess.” And now that Suri is getting older, Katie has apparently been “telling close friends that Suri is grown up that she really misses having a baby around the house.” Who knows, maybe there’ll be another little one running around in no time!  Tell us, HollywoodLifers — would you love to see Jamie and Katie have a child together? Do you think they’re in it for the long haul?	0
As the co-host of NBC’s “Today,” Matt Lauer once gave a colleague a sex toy as a present. It included an explicit note about how he wanted to use it on her, which left her mortified.  On another day, he summoned a different female employee to his office, and then dropped his pants, showing her his penis. After the employee declined to do anything, visibly shaken, he reprimanded her for not engaging in a sexual act.  He would sometimes quiz female producers about who they’d slept with, offering to trade names. And he loved to play a crass game with men and women in the office: “f—, marry, or kill,” in which he would identify the female co-hosts that he’d most like to sleep with.  These accounts of Lauer’s behavior at NBC are the result of a two-month investigation by Variety, with dozens of interviews with current and former staffers. Variety has talked to three women who identified themselves as victims of sexual harassment by Lauer, and their stories have been corroborated by friends or colleagues that they told at the time. They have asked for now to remain unnamed, fearing professional repercussions.  On Wednesday, NBC announced that Lauer was fired from “Today.” It was a stunning move for a co-host who was widely considered the crown jewel of the network’s news division, with a $25 million annual salary. The cause of his dismissal, according to sources, was a detailed complaint from another current NBC employee about inappropriate sexual conduct from Lauer that started on a trip at the Sochi Olympics in 2014 and continued for several months.  The employee met with human resources at NBC on Monday night. In a statement, NBC News Chairman Andy Lack called this the first complaint about Lauer’s behavior in more than 20 years and acknowledged that it may not be the last: “We were also presented with reason to believe that this may not have been an isolated incident,” Lack said.  Several women told Variety they complained to executives at the network about Lauer’s behavior, which fell on deaf ears given the lucrative advertising surrounding “Today.” NBC declined to comment. For most of Lauer’s tenure at “Today,” the morning news show was No. 1 in the ratings, and executives were eager to keep him happy.  It’s not clear if NBC is paying Lauer through the end of his contract, which expires in 2018. Lauer couldn’t be reached for comment.  Insiders say that NBC was forced to act quickly after this week’s complaint, given the severity of the accusations and the national dialogue around sexual harassment that has ended the careers of Harvey Weinstein, Charlie Rose, Kevin Spacey, Louis C.K. and other prominent men. Now, against a series of questions about the future of “Today,” a troubling portrait has emerged of Lauer. In front of the camera, for more than two decades, Lauer had positioned himself as America’s squeaky-clean dad. But behind the scenes, Lauer was a different person.  Despite being married, Lauer was fixated on women, especially their bodies and looks, according to more than 10 accounts from current and former employees. He was known for making lewd comments verbally or over text messages. He once made a suggestive reference to a colleague’s performance in bed and compared it to how she was able to complete her job, according to witnesses to the exchange. For Lauer, work and sex were intertwined.  “There were a lot of consensual relationships, but that’s still a problem because of the power he held,” says a former producer who knew first-hand of these encounters. “He couldn’t sleep around town with celebrities or on the road with random people, because he’s Matt Lauer and he’s married. So he’d have to do it within his stable, where he exerted power, and he knew people wouldn’t ever complain.”  Lauer, who was paranoid about being followed by tabloid reporters, grew more emboldened at 30 Rockefeller Center as his profile rose following Katie Couric’s departure from “Today” in 2006. His office was in a secluded space, and 	1

"Blake Shelton was named People's ""Sexiest Man Alive"" of 2017 and some people are not happy. Not necessarily because they don't think he's a dreamboat, but because of some tweets he sent out years ago.  While the country crooner has busied himself celebrating his new title, many on social media are blasting the magazine's decision calling upon Shelton's past tweets that have been labeled as racist, misogynistic and homophobic.  The 41-year-old first came under fire in 2016 after his followers unearthed a series of old tweets – most of which have since been deleted – that offended a lot of people.  Blake Shelton on whether he wants to be a father  ""Congratulations @blakeshelton on being voted sexiest man alive as an openly homophobic, unfaithful spouse. Grab a few p---ies, brag about it and you too can be President of the United States,"" one user tweeted.  In a 2011 tweet, he begs the person in the next room to ""learn some English so I would at least know what he's planning to bomb!!"" In another tweet from 2010, he writes about a ""sick fantasy"" he had about the then 16-year-old Dakota Fanning.  ""So I just figured out a great excuse for my sick fantasy about Dakota Fanning. I thought she was Amanda Seyfried,"" he wrote.  Here are Some more extremely homophobic tweets by @BlakeShelton . He's disgusting. pic.twitter.com/Qo8UwXQfqF — THE MUSIC TEA (@MusicFactsTea) August 13, 2016  PHOTOS: Celeb couples who can never break up  While Shelton apologized last year when the tweets first resurfaced, it seems many have not forgiven the singer and are calling on People to reconsider giving Shelton the title of ""Sexiest Man Alive.""  That's a typo. It should read Blake Shelton Sexist Man Alive. — Perry D Playford (@playford_p) November 15, 2017 blake shelton is even less sexy when you find out he’s racist and homophobic and sexist and all around a gross dude — josh lyman, human disaster (@andlivefromny) November 15, 2017 Maybe it's a typo, and Blake Shelton was meant to be named the most Sexist Man Alive? It's the only way my brain can logically make sense of this result. — Jay Thomas (@ThisJayThomas) November 15, 2017 Ah yes! A homophobe, islamaphobhic racist is always a great idea to have as the sexiest man alive! — .. (@bachelorworld_) November 15, 2017  However, many fans felt the title was well-deserved.  ""Everyone knows comedy has been a major part of my career and it’s always been out there for anyone to see,” he said in 2016. “That said anyone that knows me also knows I have no tolerance of hate of any kind or form...I deeply apologize to anybody who may have been offended."""	0
"Ryan Phillippe's ex-girlfriend is demanding a judge sanction the ""Shooter"" star for dragging his feet about turning over all text messages with his ex-wife, Reese Witherspoon, regarding an alleged assault.  According to court documents obtained by The Blast, Elsie Hewitt — who is suing Phillippe over an alleged 2017 assault — filed court docs accusing Phillippe of stalling the case for months by initially agreeing to turn over key documents and information to her ... but then failing to do so.  Phillippe and his team had told Hewitt and her lawyer that he would produce all texts with Reese but they keep missing their own deadlines.  Hewitt's attorneys say they have given Phillippe and his legal team multiple extensions to hand over the documents they requested. She claims he has yet to hand over any documents to back up his claim she ""fabricated the incident in an attempt to extort money from Phillippe.""  Hewitt wants the court to sanction Ryan Phillippe for not turning over the text messages to the tune of $12,640 and for the court to order the actor to turn over all documents she has requested.  As The Blast first reported, Hewitt sued the actor for $1 million accusing him of assaulting her at his Los Angeles home. She claimed after an argument with the actor, she went to his house to get her belongings.  Once she arrived, she claimed Phillippe was extremely agitated, grabbed her upper arm “so tightly that his grip left heavy bruises on her arm” and then “braced his body and violently threw her down his staircase as hard as he could.”  The lawsuit alleged the actor abused drugs like, “cocaine, ecstasy, psychedelic mushrooms, and steroids.”  Ryan Phillippe denied all allegations of assault and accused his ex-girlfriend of trying to extort him with false allegations.  He claimed to have only treated her with “kindness and respect” during their relationship and never physically harmed her."	1
Another day, another tell-all. HollywoodLife.com has EXCLUSIVELY learned that Khloe Kardashian fears ex-husband Lamar Odom could ‘divulge major family secrets’ in his upcoming book.  Lamar Odom, 37, is about to deliver his great slam dunk — but not everyone is cheering. The former Los Angeles Lakers superstar did in fact confirm that he’s writing a tell-all about his “life,” which everyone assumes will mention Khloe Kardashian, 33, in some parts. It’s concerning to the reality star and her entire family because the power to reveal jaw-dropping secrets lies in his hands. “They’re all very concerned about this tell-all book and have reached out to ask him to be respectful,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  Even though the basketballer has preached nothing but love over recent months, he’s gone of the rails before and it could happen again. “Lamar has spoken recklessly about her family in the past,” the source continues. “Khloe fears what major secrets he could reveal. While Khloe and the rest of the Kardashians try to live a good life, they are no saints. Like any family, they have skeletons in their closet which could seriously hurt their brand if revealed.” Lamar told reporters that “everything” is up for discussion in the tell-all, so let that be a warning to Khloe and everyone in her inner circle.  Lamar has not only dissed his ex-wife in the past, but also the men she’s dated. He thought James Harden was just another one of her “groupies” looking to ride the fame train and wasn’t thrilled about Tristan Thompson in the beginning either. But after a few months, he actually warmed up to the Cleveland Cavaliers player and gave Khloe his blessing to marry him. “They seem happy together,” he told Wendy Williams on her show, adding, “Good for them.” Let’s see how long these positive vibes last…  HollywoodLifers, if you were in Khloe’s position, how would you feel about Lamar’s tell-all?	0
"Nathan Karl Kress (born November 18, 1992) is an American actor, director, and former child model. Kress has been acting since the age of four and played the role of Freddie Benson on the Nickelodeon series iCarly.  Early life [ edit ]  Kress was born on November 18, 1992 in Glendale, California.[1][2] He has two brothers, Andrew and Kevin, neither of whom are involved in show business.[3][4] Kress began his professional career at the age of four when he displayed a natural talent for memorizing and re-enacting the shows he saw on television, prompting his mother to take him to an open ""cattle call"" showcase where he was quickly signed with a talent agent.[3][4][5] Over the next three years, Kress modeled for various print advertisements, as well as performing in numerous commercials and voice-over roles; the most notable of which was his dual role as the voices of ""Easy"" and ""Tough Pup"" in the 1998 feature film Babe: Pig in the City.[2][4][5][6][7] At the age of six, he decided to take a break from acting and return to regular school, where he led a relatively ""normal"" life for the next five years until deciding to return to acting professionally at the age of eleven.[4][5][6]  Career [ edit ]  At the age of 11, Kress was cast in the lead role as ""The Emperor"" in a school production of The Emperor's New Clothes.[4] The role rekindled his interest in performing, and at the end of his fifth grade school year, he asked his parents if he could be home-schooled so he could return to acting.[4][6] A mutual friend of Kress from school put him in touch with an agent, and after attending a summer acting ""boot camp"", Kress was soon going on real professional auditions once again.[4][5][6]  In April 2005, Kress made his first live television appearance since returning to acting in a comedy sketch on Jimmy Kimmel Live! where he played a young Simon Cowell of American Idol, and would continue to appear in various comedy sketches on the show a total of 5 times over the next year.[2][8] Kress continued to land steady work over the next two years, appearing in guest-starring roles on dramatic series such as House, Standoff, and Without a Trace as well as the Disney Channel comedy series The Suite Life of Zack & Cody.[2][3][8][9] Kress also appeared in several short films including Pickled, Magnus, Inc., and Bag, for which he was awarded a 168 Film Festival Jury Award for his portrayal of a small-fry drug dealer with a conscience.[4][8][10] In addition to live-action roles, Kress continued to work as a voice-actor, lending his voice to various characters in the animated feature film Chicken Little and on the Nickelodeon animated series Shuriken School.[8]  In February 2006, Kress landed a small role on the popular Nickelodeon family series Drake & Josh.[2][3][4][5][11] He played the role of Toplin, a ""geeky"" kid at a birthday party with a crush on Drake and Josh's younger sister Megan Parker (played by Miranda Cosgrove) in the episode Battle of Panthatar.[3][5][8] Kress did not know it at the time, but this small role would lead to an opportunity that would catapult him to stardom.[3][4][5][12] While filming his scenes for Drake & Josh, television show creator and executive producer Dan Schneider took an interest in him and called him over to talk with him and to introduce him to some network executives.[2][4][5] At the time, Schneider was developing a new series for Nickelodeon, and was on the lookout for someone to play one of the lead roles in the untitled project, which would later become known as iCarly.[4][5][11]  The role of Toplin was similar to a character named Freddie that Schneider was looking to cast on iCarly.[3][4][5] Schneider had been so impressed with Kress' performance that he remembered him, and about 6 months after filming his small role on Drake & Josh, Kress was called in to audition for the role of ""Freddie"" shortly after his fourteenth birthday.[3][4][5] After several rounds of auditions, Kress was invited back for a "	1

Despite having a new baby at home, Kanye West has been M.I.A., leaving Kim Kardashian to care for their newborn herself — and the reality star is livid, according to a new report.  Third time may not be the charm for Kim Kardashian and Kanye West! The rapper is reportedly completely ignoring his duties as a new dad in the weeks since the couple’s daughter, Chicago West, was born. Just days after Chicago’s birth, Kanye jetted off to New York for several days, leaving Kim home alone with all three kids, and when he is home, he’s been refusing to change diapers or wake up for late night feedings, according to Star. “Kim let it slide the first time, but she was counting on counting on Kanye to help out around the house because she already has her hands full,” the mag’s insider claims. “Kim was furious when Kanye told her to just hire another nanny. She made it clear that he petter start pulling his weight — or else.”  Chicago was born via surrogate on Jan. 15, and is just one of the newest additions to the Kardashian family. On Feb. 1, Kylie Jenner, 20, gave birth to her first child — a baby girl named Stormi Webster. That means Kim and Kylie’s daughters are less than one month apart, and Kim wrote the sweetest message to her little sis about it. “I’m so incredibly proud of the woman you have grown up to be and I know that you are going to be the best mom to your new baby girl!” she gushed. “Our girls are two weeks apart and I can’t wait for them to be besties! I am so proud that you do what you want to do and live your life the way you want you will pass down all of those amazing qualities to your baby girl. You were made to be a mom!”  Meanwhile, Khloe Kardashian is currently pregnant with her first child, and is due at the end of March/beginning of April — so there’ll be another little one added to the mix in just a couple of months!  HollywoodLifers, do you think Kanye will step up as a dad?	0
This Is Us is toying with an alternate timeline in the Season 2 finale—and it’s not via a flashback or a flash forward. While the episode, titled “The Wedding,” will feature some upbeat moments as Kate Pearson (Chrissy Metz) gets ready to marry her longtime love Toby (Chris Sullivan), emotions will run high as she walks down the aisle without her dearly departed dad (Milo Ventimiglia) by her side.  But now, promos for “The Wedding” episode confirm that Jack will be back for his little girl’s big day. The teaser for the This Is Us season 2 finale shows Jack Pearson in the present day, sporting gray hair, a salt-and-pepper goatee, and wire-rimmed glasses as he touches his wife Rebecca’s (Mandy Moore) face and says, “Where’d the time go, Bec?”  This Is Us fans (and pretty much the rest of the universe) know that Jack Pearson died on Super Bowl Sunday in 1998 when he was 53 years old. The Pearson patriarch saved the family dog (and a pillowcase full of family belongings!) after a house fire, but he couldn’t save himself. Complications from smoke inhalation did Papa Pearson in, and now Kate’s wedding marks 20 years since his tragic passing.  The trailer for “The Wedding” features a flashback of a younger Jack telling 10-year-old Kate (Mackenzie Hancsicsak): “The guy that gets to marry you, Katey girl, he is one lucky guy.” Later, we see adult Kate flanked by her brothers Kevin and Randall (Justin Hartley, Sterling K. Brown) as she walks down the aisle. The promo teases a “special guest” at Kate and Toby’s wedding and that’s when old man Jack is seen.  While Milo Ventimiglia’s appearance as a 70-something Jack Pearson is likely a dream, This Is Us fans may recall last season when Randall had a hallucination and saw Jack standing on a ladder at the family cabin. The cabin is also the setting for Kate’s wedding.  This won’t be the first time This Is Us has introduced an older version of a character that fell outside of the timelines the NBC drama usually focuses on. During the post-Super Bowl episode, 37-year-old Randall was shown in the future as a man in this 50s. At the time, This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman teased the alternate timeline to Deadline, saying, “We show a new timeline, in the future, which is extremely exciting for a show that plays in time and has till-now played in the past/present. But there is other stuff coming, too…there is a plan for the show, there always has been, we aren’t just shooting from the hip.” Fogelman has said the future may play a big part in This Is Us seasons to come.  Loading...  'This Is Us': Jack Pearson Is Old, Grey and Not Dead in Season 2 Finale Promo (Video)@NBCThisIsUs #ThisIsUs https://t.co/lGIseonNAg pic.twitter.com/uVgFYNq8sL — TheWrap (@TheWrap) March 7, 2018  In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, This Is Us star Susan Kelechi Watson, who plays Randall’s wife Beth Pearson on the show, said “The Wedding” episode will be a special one.  “It’s beautiful,” Kelechi Watson said. “It felt like the natural way for this season to end. We built to this moment, so it feels very natural — this is what’s coming next, the wedding. But yet, even in the midst of all that, life for the Pearsons for each individual is still happening. So everybody is still dealing with their own stuff, but now we get to celebrate at this family event that we’ve been anticipating and feel good about. After a hard year — I mean, this was a rough one for the family, going through Jack’s death and the fire, and for slow-cookers— it’s a really beautiful way to celebrate.”  The This Is Us season 2 finale airs Tuesday at 9 p.m. ET on NBC.	1
"Harry Styles knows that you care way more than you should about his relationship with ex-girlfriend Taylor Swift, and he's ready to play with your feelings a little more.  Onstage at one of his concerts the other night, Styles mentioned Swift in such a sly way, that fans are already praying for a reunion. Wishing an audience member happy birthday, Styles asked how old she was turning, to which the fan replied, ""22."" It's not hard to guess what happened next.  Announcing the news to the audience, Styles said, ""22. She’s 22, okay? I don’t know about..."" And as every Swift fan knows, that's exactly how the lyrics to ""22"" go. You can watch the whole interaction on Twitter:    Unfortunately, Styles didn't launch into a full-on cover of ""22,"" although he should definitely consider doing so in a future set.  Styles and Swift started dating in November 2012, and were photographed together for the first time in December the same year, when they were spotted in Central Park. Perez Hilton reported their breakup on January 7, 2013, with a source revealing, ""They are both really busy and never in one place for long. Harry's really upset about the split and is really sensitive about it."" They both went on to write songs about each other.  the tea is that harry will never forget taylor as long as he lives as well pic.twitter.com/jyutkmDj95 — hanna🏹 (@poeticsswift) March 19, 2018  imagine thinking taylor alison swift and harry edward styles aren’t soulmates — juliet (@seIenatayIors) March 21, 2018  me: i'm over haylor now they're both in separate relationships and it's been years  harry: taylor  me: HELLO BITCH! — ash 💘 (@thestorycfus) March 19, 2018  Perhaps the best things that Swift has bestowed upon the world are the copious references to ex-boyfriends that she's scattered throughout her discography. Instead of having to rely on gossip and paparazzi photos, fans of the ""Look What You Made Me Do"" singer can relive every relationship she's had via intimate song lyrics, and hidden album liner notes. And clearly, Styles loves Swift's work as much as the rest of us."	1

The great pendulum of Anne Hathaway hatred has begun to swing the other way.  When Hathaway greeted her 2013 Oscar win with a whispered, “It came true!” she was one of the most hated movie stars in America. People hated her constant smile, her theater-kid eagerness, her desperate and palpable thirst for approval.  “My my,” said Alexis Rhiannon on Crushable, in what would become the iconic manifesto of the Hathahater, “what a large beautiful mouth. I don’t like it. Look at those dark beautiful eyes. I don’t like them. Listen to her skinny beautiful words. I don’t like them. Shut up. Shut up, Anne Hathaway.”  There was think piece after think piece about why everyone hated Anne Hathaway, and every interviewer who talked to her asked about them. They still do.  “It comes up in every interview I do, just about,” Hathaway said of the “why does everyone hate her” narrative, in an interview last week with Rich Juzwiak for Jezebel. “I am … not eager, but I am ready for the conversation to move to a place beyond it.”  It’s a thoughtful, graceful interview, one that ends with Juzwiak recognizing his own role in perpetuating Hathahate and repenting for it. Afterward, people approvingly passed around screencaps on Twitter, and talked about how unfair it is that people say mean things about Hathaway so often.  It’s now culturally acceptable to say that 2013’s Anne Hathaway hatred was based on systemic misogyny, just as it was culturally acceptable to say in 2013 that you hated Anne Hathaway.  if you've always been aware of the ways gender bias affected how society treated Anne Hathaway, you are Hathawoke — Kevin O'Keeffe (@kevinpokeeffe) April 4, 2017  But that shift doesn’t have all that much to do with Hathaway herself. Nor is it because we are all exponentially more woke now than we were in 2013. It has to do with where Hathaway is in her publicity cycle.  You can see her cycle repeated in what’s been happening to Jennifer Lawrence and Taylor Swift over the past few years. It all follows a very familiar pattern, because the life cycle of a Hollywood starlet is fairly standard.  Phase 1: This woman is pretty, and she’s talented!  The earliest phase is the most basic, and some lucky starlets manage to stay there for their entire careers. It expresses itself in the form of a mildly condescending expression of bewilderment that a telegenic young woman is also good at her job: Jennifer Lawrence was so good in Winter’s Bone, and she’s a babe on the red carpet! Taylor Swift is a tall, skinny blonde, and she writes a catchy pop song!  For Anne Hathaway, that moment came in 2005 when she appeared in Brokeback Mountain. In review after review, Hathaway (one year removed from The Princess Diaries 2) and Michelle Williams (one year removed from Dawson’s Creek) were both singled out with a faint note of surprise: Turns out those pretty girls from the teenybopper world can really act!  Phase 2: This woman is absolutely everywhere, and I love her  It’s when the starlet advances to phase two that she’s in danger. This is where Jennifer Lawrence was in 2012, and where Taylor Swift was in 2014: the point where the starlet is up for major awards, on the cover of every magazine, featured on every talk show, and roundly declared to be the best thing since sliced bread.  In 2012, Lawrence was starring in The Hunger Games and Silver Linings Playbook, and she was killing it on the interview circuit. She was the celebrity everybody wanted to have brunch with. She was so beloved that Vice called up a bunch of hate groups to see if they had anything bad to say about J Law, and none of them did. (The Hathahaters were at their height at the end of that year, and many of the “Why does everyone hate Anne Hathaway?” think pieces pitted Hathaway against the wildly popular Lawrence.)  In 2014, Swift had just released 1989, and the media was madly in love with her witchy in-on-the-joke “Blank Space” video, her kicky short hair, and her newly created girl squad. Rolling S	0
"American singer-songwriter, musician  Christopher John Cornell (né Boyle; July 20, 1964 – May 18, 2017) was an American musician, singer and songwriter. He was best known as the lead vocalist and primary lyricist for rock bands Soundgarden and Audioslave. Cornell was also known for his numerous solo works and soundtrack contributions since 1991, and as the founder and frontman of Temple of the Dog, the one-off tribute band dedicated to his late friend Andrew Wood.  Cornell is considered one of the chief architects of the 1990s grunge movement, and is well known for his extensive catalog as a songwriter, his nearly four-octave vocal range,[2] and his powerful vocal belting technique. He released four solo studio albums, Euphoria Morning (1999), Carry On (2007), Scream (2009), Higher Truth (2015) and the live album Songbook (2011). Cornell received a Golden Globe Award nomination for his song ""The Keeper"", which appeared in the 2011 film Machine Gun Preacher, and co-wrote and performed the theme song to the James Bond film Casino Royale (2006), ""You Know My Name"". His last solo release before his death was the charity single ""The Promise"", written for the ending credits for the 2016 film of the same name.  Across his entire catalog, Cornell has sold 14.8 million albums, 8.8 million digital songs, and 300 million on-demand audio streams in the U.S. alone,[3][4] as well as over 30 million records worldwide.[5][6][7] He was nominated for 16 Grammy Awards and won three.[8][9] He was voted ""Rock's Greatest Singer"" by readers of Guitar World,[10] ranked 4th in the list of ""Heavy Metal's All-Time Top 100 Vocalists"" by Hit Parader,[11] 9th in the list of ""Best Lead Singers of All Time"" by Rolling Stone,[12] and 12th in MTV's ""22 Greatest Voices in Music"".[13]  Cornell struggled with depression for most of his life. He was found dead in his Detroit hotel room early on the morning of May 18, 2017, after performing at a Soundgarden concert an hour earlier at the Fox Theatre. His death was ruled a suicide by hanging.[3]  Early life [ edit ]  Cornell was born Christopher John Boyle on July 20, 1964,[14][15] in Seattle, Washington, where he was raised. His parents are Edward F. Boyle,[16] a pharmacist of Irish-Catholic background,[17][18] and Karen Cornell,[16][18] an accountant and psychic of Jewish background.[19][17][20][21] After his parents' divorce when he was a teenager, Chris and his siblings adopted their mother's maiden name, Cornell, as their surname.[20][14] Cornell was one of six children; he had two older brothers and three younger sisters.[14] He attended Christ the King Catholic elementary school,[22] where he performed for the first time in front of a crowd, singing the 1960s anti-war song ""One Tin Soldier"".[22] He later attended Shorewood High School.[23][24] When he was in seventh grade, his mother pulled him and his sister out of Catholic school; Cornell claimed because they were about to be expelled for being too inquisitive.[25] Cornell recalled the episode in a 1994 interview: ""With a religion like that, it's not designed for anyone to question. Being young people who have a natural curiosity and half a brain, you're going to start finding inconsistencies, which there are tons of in organized religion. We both sort of made it clear in classroom situations that we didn't get it. 'Explain this to me.' And they couldn't, so we started creating a lot of problems.""[25]  Cornell traced his musical influences back to Little Richard via The Beatles.[26] He spent a two-year period between the ages of nine and eleven solidly listening to The Beatles after finding a large collection of Beatles records abandoned in the basement of a neighbor's house.[27] He described himself at this age as a loner; he was able to deal with his anxiety around other people through rock music.[28] During his teenage years, he spiraled into severe depression, dropped out of school, and almost never left the house.[29] At the age of 12, he had access to"	1
Just call him Uncle Brad! Brad Pitt’s finally met the Clooney twins, & we learned exclusively that he came baring special gifts — including the same type of African doll his daughter Zahara had as a kid. How cute!  Ella and Alexander Clooney may only be three weeks old, but they sure have some famous faces in their corner — including one of dad George Clooney‘s, 56, BFFs Brad Pitt, 53! And in meeting the baby twins for the first time, of course “Uncle Brad” brought gifts, AND fatherly advice. While George and his wife Amal Clooney, 39, are currently residing in England and, as of right now, are planning on raising their children there too, Brad was recently in London and got to pay his old friends a visit. “Uncle Brad swung through London to see George and Amal and to meet their new babies during his time in Europe,” a Brad insider revealed to HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  “Brad even brought gifts for the little ones.” We can imagine it’d be hard to pick out gifts for the kids who most likely have everything, but we think the War Machine actor did an amazing job of selecting a super thoughtful and sentimental present. “Brad bought the kids new matching toy dolls from Africa,” our source continued. “Zahara [Jolie-Pitt, 12] fell in love with the same type of toy doll when she was a baby, and Brad wanted to help recreate the same fond memories with George and his new children.” It doesn’t get much cuter than that!  Brad didn’t JUST bring tangible items though, he also came with pearls of wisdom — specifically for George. “Brad even shared some fatherly advice with George on how to prevent diaper rash, which Amal thought was hilarious,” our insider added. LOL. But although George isn’t an experienced father, as Ella and Alexander are his first kids, he’s already LOVING his new role as dad.  “George says the biggest thing he’s learned since becoming a father is the absolute joy and wonder of unconditional love. Obviously, he’s loved, and continues to love, many people in his life — with Amal being his greatest love, and his soulmate. But the twins’ birth has taken it to a whole new level,” a different source told us EXCLUSIVELY. “George would seriously lay down his life in a heartbeat for Alexander and Ella, and even now, when he looks at them snuggled up, he is overcome with emotion and brought to the verge of tears.” Brad has twins himself — Knox and Vivienne, 8 — which means he TOTALLY gets what George is experiencing right now!  Tell us, HollywoodLifers — do you love how close Brad and George are? Are you excited for their kids to meet?	0

Melania Trump Switches Up Her Style in a Military-Inspired Ensemble  Melania Trump took an edgy step away from her usually simple yet elegant style on Thursday.  The First Lady joined President Donald Trump at the White House for a meeting with the Argentinian President Mauricio Macri and his wife, Juliana Awada. Melania opted for a military-inspired ensemble, wearing an army green matching skirt and peplum-style blazer from Altuzarra's Spring 2017 collection.  The coordinating outfit featured thick, black and white python piping with oversized black buttons. The jacket featured a silver belt fascinator to create the peplum look at her waist. The skirt, on the other hand, displayed asymmetrical piping with buttons down the side.  Melania accessorized the look with a pair of python Manolo Blahnik BB pumps, which patched the piping of her ensemble, and finished it off by wearing her hair down in loose waves.  Meanwhile, a day before stepping out in the edgy style, the First Lady celebrated her 47th birthday at the White House.  According to a White House official, she started the day by attending a luncheon for Senate spouses at the National Gallery of Art. Then, she hosted several meetings with members of her staff to discuss a variety of issues throughout the day.  But it wasn't all work. Last night, the Trump family held a private celebration in the White House.	1
by Krystal Franklin  January 19, 2018  Photo by Andrew Toth/Getty Images  Anika Noni Rose opened up to SiriusXM about being sexually assaulted on plane last year.  “I have never spoken of this, but I will say this out loud now: I was assaulted on a plane last year. And I haven’t been able to get this person’s name; they won’t give me the name of the person.”  According to reports, the Tony winner said the incident happened without warning and that she didn’t even know the person.  There was no, ‘Hi, how are you doing?’ And I was asleep before the plane even took off; I’m one of those sleepers. I wanted to punch that man, and I knew that that would take away from the story that I had to tell. I had to hold in everything that I was feeling to be able to tell this story and be heard and taken seriously from the place I was in. It’s been…interesting.”  And while the man was removed from the plane, Anika hasn’t been given her perpetrator’s name  “There’s a Freedom of Information act. You’re supposed to be able to get people’s names. I made a report right then with the FBI and they dropped it. They dropped the case,” she said.  Listen below.  The actress has since taken to social media to share a gratitude of thanks after bravely sharing her story.  Just want to thank everyone who has sent me positive thoughts and support.

People were pushing for them to hook up from the start, but judging by how inseparable they are these days, it seems to have already happened.” Praise be!	0

"Jay-Z admits his marriage to Beyoncé 'wasn’t totally built on the 100% truth'  As part of his apology tour surrounding his new album 4:44, Jay-Z admitted an uncomfortable new truth about his marriage — and he's getting other male celebrities to do the same.  The rapper is releasing a series of Tidal documentaries digging deeper into specific tracks from 4:44, which dropped earlier this month. The latest video, Footnotes for 4:44, is an 11-minute clip released Monday featuring celebrities including Jesse Williams, Chris Rock, Will Smith, Kendrick Lamar, Aziz Ansari and Mahershala Ali discussing race, relationships and masculinity.  For his part, Jay got candid about his sometimes-troubled relations with Beyonce, after spending a considerable part of 4:44 owning up to the misdeeds she sang about on Lemonade.  “This is my real life,"" he said. ""I just ran into this place and we built this big, beautiful mansion of a relationship that wasn’t totally built on the 100% truth and it starts cracking.""  ""Things start happening that the public can see,” he continued. “Then we had to get to a point of ‘Okay, tear this down and let’s start from the beginning' … It’s the hardest thing I’ve ever done.”  Elsewhere in the video, Jesse Williams referenced his recent divorce from Aryn Drake-Lee and the cheating rumors that followed.  “I was in a relationship 13 years, 13 real years, not five years, not seven years – 13 years,” Williams said. “All of a sudden (expletives) are writing think-pieces that I somehow threw a 13-year relationship.""  The Grey's Anatomy actor called the breakup ""the most painful experience I’ve had in my life, like, with a person I’ve loved with all of my heart,"" and denied the rumors ""that I threw a person and my family in the trash because a girl I work with is cute.”  Footnotes for 4:44 follows Tidal's previously-released Footnotes for The Story of O.J., which digs deeper into the politically-motivated track.  For Jay fans hoping to see 4:44 live, the rapper announced a 31-city tour on Monday, which kicks off in October."	1

For other uses, see Fyre (disambiguation)  Fraudulent music festival  Fyre Festival Fyre Festival Logo Dates April 28–30 and May 5–7, 2017 Location(s) Exuma, The Bahamas Years active 2017 Founded by Billy McFarland/Fyre Media App[1] Attendance ≈5,000  Fyre Festival was a fraudulent luxury music festival founded by Billy McFarland, CEO of Fyre Media Inc, and rapper Ja Rule. It was created with the intent of promoting the company's Fyre app for booking music talent. The festival was scheduled to take place on April 28–30 and May 5–7, 2017, on the Bahamian island of Great Exuma.  The event was promoted on Instagram by ""social media influencers"" including Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid, Hailey Baldwin and Emily Ratajkowski, many of whom did not initially disclose they had been paid to do so.[1] During the Fyre Festival's inaugural weekend, the event experienced problems related to security, food, accommodation, medical services and artist relations, resulting in the festival being postponed indefinitely. Instead of the luxury villas and gourmet meals for which festival attendees paid thousands of dollars, they received prepackaged sandwiches and FEMA tents as their accommodation.[2]  In March 2018, McFarland pleaded guilty to one count of wire fraud to defraud investors and ticket holders, and a second count to defraud a ticket vendor that occurred while out on bail.[3] In October 2018, McFarland was sentenced to six years in prison and ordered to forfeit US $26 million.[3] The organizers became the subject of at least eight lawsuits, several seeking class action status, and one seeking more than $100 million in damages. The cases accuse the organizers of defrauding ticket buyers.  Two documentaries about the events of the festival were released in 2019: Hulu's Fyre Fraud,[4] and Netflix's Fyre: The Greatest Party That Never Happened.[5][6]  Planning and organization [ edit ]  Billy MacFarland and Ja Rule at the 2016 Web Summit  An aircraft featuring Fyre Festival branding, used to transport attendees to the festival.  The festival was organized by Billy McFarland and Ja Rule,[2] to promote the Fyre music booking app.[1] Ja Rule had come to know McFarland through regular visits to events McFarland hosted at his previous venture, Magnises. During a flight to the Bahamas, McFarland and Ja Rule's private plane touched down on a lightly populated island which they later discovered was Norman's Cay, the former private island of Carlos Lehder Rivas, a kingpin of the Medellín Cartel.[7] McFarland arranged to lease the island from the current owners on the strict condition that he make no reference to the Pablo Escobar connection in any marketing materials.[8]  Promotional footage with hired supermodels was shot on Norman's Cay, and planning for the festival went ahead. In early 2017, after a promotional video was released on social media advertising Norman's Cay as ""once owned by Pablo Escobar"", the owners immediately cancelled the arrangement with McFarland.[9] In reality, Pablo Escobar never owned Norman's Cay. And when they were kicked off of Norman's Cay, they only had four months before their inaugural festival on April 28-30th.  After several small islands that seemed like likely venues were turned down, and with only two months to go before the Fyre Festival, the Bahamian government gave McFarland a permit to use a site set aside for development at Roker Point (Coordinates: ) on Great Exuma, just north of the Sandals Resort.[10] Material released on social media continued to promote the falsehood that the Festival was being hosted on Pablo Escobar's private island, with maps of the site altered to make it appear as if Roker Point was an island unto itself.[8]  In reality, the Festival was in a remote parking lot north of a Sandals Resort and a nearby marina where the locals would store their boats. Furthermore, Great Exuma wasn't a pr"	1
"Plus: Features on The Rock and Kylie Jenner—how they each earned $100m+ this year  On the Cover: Personality and Makeup Guru, Kylie Jenner  #Celeb100  NEW YORK (July 16, 2018) – Floyd Mayweather ($285 mil in pretax annual earnings), captures the top spot on Forbes’ 20th annual Celebrity 100 ranking of the world’s highest-paid celebrities (p. 106 in Forbes’ August 31, 2018 magazine issue). The boxer’s August 2017 fight versus Conor McGregor generated more than $550 million in revenue, with Money Mayweather earning $275 million, securing him the No. 1 spot for the second year since 2015. George Clooney ($239 mil) is in the No. 2 spot after British liquor giant Diageo purchased Casamigos, the tequila company Clooney cofounded, giving him the best annual take-home of his—or any actor’s—career. Kylie Jenner ($166.5 mil) returns to the list at No. 3, a significant jump from the 2017 newcomer’s spot at No. 59, followed by Judge Judy Sheindlin ($147 mil) at No. 4. Dwayne ‘The Rock’ Johnson, earning $124 million, rounds out the top five. The Rock (story p. 102) nearly doubled his 2017 $65 million payday, and his acting-related earnings are the largest ever recorded in the 20 years Forbes has tracked the Celebrity 100.  2018 Celebrity 100 Highlights:  The world’s 100 top-earning entertainers pulled in a combined $6.3 billion pretax over the past 12 months, up 22% from last year, and the third highest sum in the list’s 20-year history. Over the past two decades, more than 700 actors, actresses, musicians and other stars have appeared on the list, accumulating a total of $80 billion in earnings.  List members represent 17 countries: U.S., U.K., Barbados, Portugal, Ireland, Brazil, Argentina, Australia, Switzerland, Canada, China, Mexico, Colombia, Germany, Spain, Greece, India.  The Celeb 100 earnings minimum is $35 million, and 11 entertainers have earned $100 million or more over the past year – more than double the number from the past two years combined.  Roger Waters (No. 28), cofounder of Pink Floyd, joins the ranking for the first time as the largest-earning newcomer, along with musicians Imagine Dragons (No. 89) and Nas (No. 98). Also new to the list are a handful of NFL players including Matt Ryan, Matthew Stafford, Derek Carr, Alex Smith, Trumaine Johnson, Jimmy Garoppolo, Ryan Tannehill and Von Miller, who earned a combined $353.5 mil. Sean ‘Diddy’ Combs, who held the top spot in 2017, dropped to No. 32. Combs’ paycheck dipped from $130 million in 2017 to $64 million in 2018 because last year’s total was inflated by a massive tour and selling a chunk of his Sean John clothing line.  “Forbes has been publishing the Celebrity 100 for 20 years, but there’s never been a more lucrative time to be famous than now, with 11 superstars earning $100 million or more over the past year,” says Zack O’Malley Greenburg, senior editor of media & entertainment. “Entertainers have found all sorts of new ways to monetize their audiences, especially with the help of social media—one need look no further than The Rock and Kylie Jenner, both in our top five.”  Featured on the cover of the August 31, 2018 issue of Forbes magazine is Natalie Robehmed’s profile of Kylie Jenner. The 20-year-old mother, reality television star and owner of Kylie Cosmetics is ranked No. 3 with $166.5 million in earnings and later this year will likely take the title Mark Zuckerberg and Bill Gates once held: the world’s youngest ever self-made billionaire. Her momager, Kris Jenner, joined the Celeb 100 this year for the first time thanks to the success of her daughters. The cover story provides an inside look at how celebrities like Jenner and The Rock are using social media to market themselves and reach mammoth followings – in Jenner’s case over 110 million Instagram followers. ""Social media is an amazing platform,"" says Jenner. ""I have such easy access to my fans and my customers.""

Reverend Swadley – the local wedding priest and friend of the Pitt family – has confirmed to friends that the A-list couple recently spent a week with Brad’s family, discussing detailed plans for a wedding.  It’s believed the loved-up stars had flown to Missouri because Jen was desperate to reconnect with Brad’s mum, Jane, who she’d developed a very close bond with throughout the time of their first marriage.  During the seven-day visit, it’s been revealed that Jane orchestrated a meeting with the family priest Reverend Swadley – hoping it would be the gentle push Brad and Jen would need to make their reignited relationship official once again.  ‘Reverend Swadley met Jen recently at a family function that Brad’s mum, Jane, threw at their family home in Missouri,’ a close friend of the pastor’s told New Idea exclusively.  ‘Jen accompanied Brad home on the trip and attended church services with the family as well as joining Brad at meetings at the now-retired reverend’s home, who Brad reconnected with after he decided to find himself and renew his faith, following his split from Ange.  ‘He remarked at how at ease Jen was with his family, who clearly adore her, and how everyone said how much she’s been missed and how happy they all were to have her back in Brad’s – and their – lives.’  The source goes on to reveal that Reverend Swadley spoke at length with Brad and Jen about getting married as soon as possible, in Missouri, in a small ceremony, with just local friends and family present.  ‘Reverend Swadley revealed how in love Brad and Jen were and how they planned to officially wed as soon as their divorces were finalised, with him agreeing to conduct the ceremony and welcome them both back into the church,’ the friend of the pastor told New Idea.  Reverend Swadley revealed to our source that it was clear Jen loved seeing Brad’s family again, spending long days talking and laughing for the first time since their 2005 divorce.  ‘Jen spent five days reconnecting with Brad’s parents, brother and sister and many of his childhood friends who he remains close to,’ a friend of the pastor reveals.  Brad Pitt's parents are nothing but supportive Getty  ‘He said Jen kept saying how grateful she was that they’d been brought back together. And how they’ll both be baptised later this year before they officially wed – with Jen’s father, John, vowing to be at her side for the service and give her away again at their wedding, which will hopefully take place shortly after and be far more low-key than their original star-studded nuptials in Malibu.’  It’s the latest chapter in the pair’s rekindled romance since Jen announced her split from estranged husband Justin Theroux in February. She has wasted no time in rebuilding her relationship with ex-husband Brad, spending time with his six children, and developing a unique and special bond with his 11-year-old daughter Shiloh.  It’s that close relationship between Jen and his kids that has prompted Brad to want to marry Jen as soon as soon as possible.  ‘Brad’s mum Jane was all over them to get married as soon as possible, but the truth is Brad needs no convincing,’ says a source close to Brad. ‘They still want to keep this relationship close to their chest and out of the public eye, but behind closed doors they couldn’t be happier.  ‘And for Brad, seeing how much his children – especially Shiloh – love Jen has just made his heart soar. He knows he wants Jen to be his wife again.  ‘We’re pretty sure they’ll be married in Missouri before the end of the year, Brad and Jen are both keen to push through their divorces as soon as possible so they can walk down the aisle together. That’s all that they want.’  For the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!	0
"American reality television personality and retired Olympic decathlete champion  Caitlyn Marie Jenner (born William Bruce Jenner; October 28, 1949) is an American television personality and retired Olympic gold medal–winning decathlete.  Jenner played college football for the Graceland Yellowjackets before incurring a knee injury that required surgery. Convinced by Olympic decathlete Jack Parker's coach, L. D. Weldon, to try the decathlon, Jenner won the men's decathlon event at the 1976 Summer Olympics in Montreal,[3][4] setting a third successive world record and gaining fame as ""an all-American hero"".[5] Given the unofficial title of ""world's greatest athlete"",[6] Jenner established a career in television, film, writing, auto racing, business, and as a Playgirl cover model.[7]  Jenner has six children with three successive wives—Chrystie Crownover, Linda Thompson, and Kris Jenner—and has since 2007 appeared on the reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians with Kris, their daughters Kendall and Kylie Jenner, and Kris's other children Kourtney, Kim, Khloé, and Rob Kardashian. Assigned male at birth, Caitlyn Jenner publicly came out as a trans woman in April 2015. Her new name was publicly announced in July of that year, with her name and gender being legally changed the following September.[8] From 2015 to 2016, Jenner starred in the reality television series I Am Cait, which focused on her gender transition. In January 2017, she underwent sex reassignment surgery.[9] Jenner has been called the most famous transgender woman in the world.[10][11]  Early life  Caitlyn Marie Jenner was born William Bruce Jenner on October 28, 1949, in Mount Kisco, New York.[12] She was known as Bruce Jenner until June 2015. Her parents are Esther Ruth (née McGuire) and William Hugh Jenner, who was an arborist.[13][14] She is of English, Scottish, Irish, Dutch, and Welsh descent.[15] Her younger brother, Burt, was killed in a car accident in Canton, Connecticut on November 30, 1976, shortly after Jenner's success at the Olympic Games.[16][17] As a young child, Jenner was diagnosed with dyslexia.[18]  Jenner attended Sleepy Hollow High School in Sleepy Hollow, New York, for her freshman and sophomore years[19][20] and Newtown High School in Newtown, Connecticut, for her junior and senior years, graduating in 1968.[21] Jenner earned a football scholarship and attended Graceland College (now Graceland University) in Lamoni, Iowa, but was forced to stop playing football because of a knee injury.[22] Recognizing Jenner's potential, Graceland track coach L. D. Weldon encouraged Jenner to switch to the decathlon.[23] Jenner debuted as a decathlete in 1970 in the Drake Relays decathlon in Des Moines, Iowa, finishing in fifth place.[24] Jenner graduated from Graceland College in 1973 with a degree in physical education.[25]  Decathlon career  All mentioned Olympic events were men's events which took place prior to Jenner's gender transition.  Early career  At the 1972 U.S. Olympic trials in Eugene, Oregon, Jenner was in fifth place in the men's decathlon, behind Steve Gough and Andrew Pettes, with only the last event remaining. Needing to make up a 19-second gap on Gough in the men's 1500 metres, Jenner qualified for the Olympic team by running a fast final lap, finishing 22 seconds ahead of the other runners. This prompted the Eugene Register-Guard to ask: ""Who's Jenner?""[26][27] Following the Olympic Trials, Jenner finished in tenth place in the decathlon at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich.[28] By watching Soviet Mykola Avilov win the event, Jenner was inspired to start an intense training regimen. ""For the first time, I knew what I wanted out of life and that was it, and this guy has it. I literally started training that night at midnight, running through the streets of Munich, Germany, training for the Games. I trained that day on through the 1976 Games, 6–8 hours a day, every day, 365 days a year.""[29]  After graduating from Gracel"	0

"American Media, Inc. (AMI) is an American publisher of magazines, supermarket tabloids, and books based in New York City. Originally affiliated with only the National Enquirer, the media company's holdings expanded considerably in the 1990s and 2000s. In November 2010, American Media filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection due to debts of nearly $1 billion, but has continued to buy and sell magazine brands since then.  AMI has been in the news affiliated with accusations of catch and kill operations. On December 12, 2018, the U.S. Attorney's Office reported that AMI admitted to paying $150,000 to Karen McDougal in concert with a candidate's presidential campaign for the sole purpose of preventing damaging allegations prior to the 2016 US presidential election.[2][3]  According to its September 2018 non-prosecution agreement with Southern District of New York federal prosecutors, AMI ""shall commit no crimes whatsoever"" for three years, otherwise ""A.M.I. shall thereafter be subject to prosecution for any federal criminal violation of which this office has knowledge.""[4]  On April 10, 2019, Chatham Asset Management, which controls 80 percent of AMI's stock, forced AMI to sell the National Enquirer.[5][6] This came after Chatham owner Anthony Melchiorre, who AMI has also relied on for survival, expressed dismay over the tabloid magazine's recent scandals involving hush money assistance to U.S. President Donald Trump's 2016 campaign and blackmail of Jeff Bezos.[5][6] On April 18, 2019, AMI agreed to sell not only the National Enquirer, but two of its other publications, Globe and National Examiner, to Hudson Group.[7][8]  History [ edit ]  The modern American Media came into being after Generoso Pope Jr., longtime owner of the National Enquirer, died in 1988, and his tabloids came under new ownership. American tabloids began consolidating in 1990, when American Media bought Star from Rupert Murdoch. The purchase of Globe Communications (owner of the Globe and the National Examiner) followed nine years later.[9] Roger Altman, through Evercore Partners, bought a controlling stake in American Media in 1999.[10]  American Media is not to be confused with American Media Distribution the international news coverage firm. American Media's former corporate headquarters in Boca Raton, Florida, figured prominently in news headlines in late 2001, after an anthrax attack was perpetrated on the company[11] and other media outlets.[12] Since then the corporate headquarters have moved to New York City at 1 Park Avenue in Manhattan, before moving to the Financial District to the former JP Morgan Chase headquarters at 4 New York Plaza. That building was severely damaged by Hurricane Sandy but reopened in February 2013. The CEO, David J. Pecker, travels between the Boca Raton and New York offices while managing the company.[citation needed]  AMI continued to expand after it bought Joe Weider's Weider Publications in 2002. Joe Weider continued to manage control of his magazines under AMI's Weider Publications subsidiary until his death in March 2013.[13][14]  American Media also owns Distribution Services, an in-store magazine merchandising company. In fall 2002, it launched the book-publishing imprint, AMI Books.[15]  2010s: Bankruptcy and continued acquisitions [ edit ]  In 2009, American Media was taken over by its bondholders to keep it out of bankruptcy.[16]  In November 2010, American Media filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection due to nearly $1 billion in debt, and assets of less than $50,000.[17] Its subsidiary, American Media Operations Inc., listed assets of $100 to $500 million and debt of over $1 billion.[18] It exited in December.  In May 2014, American Media announced a decision to shift the headquarters of the National Enquirer from Florida, where it had been located since 1971, back to New York City, where it originally began as The New York Enquirer in 1926.[19] In August 2014, American Media was acquired by Chatham Asset Mana"	0
"Shakira is having to postpone her tour for the second time  Shakira has pushed back the start date of her world tour for the second time as she battles vocal cord problems.  The Colombian singer moved her El Dorado world tour from November to January, but has now told fans she needs more time to recover and will have to wait until June to start the shows.

Dogs now welcome at Disney World resorts  Walt Disney World Resort is letting the dogs in.  Guests can now travel with their dogs to four Disney World resorts. The hotels are Disney’s Yacht Club Resort, Disney Port Orleans Resort – Riverside, Disney’s Art of Animation Resort and the cabins at Disney’s Fort Wilderness Resort & Campground.  The resorts are still somewhat leashing in their dog-owner guests.  The dogs have to be well-behaved, leashed in public areas at the resort and properly vaccinated. Only two dogs per room are allowed. And Disney is calling this a pilot program vs. a permanent one.  There are also nightly pet-cleaning fees involved:  Disney’s Art of Animation Resort: $50  Disney’s Port Orleans Riverside Resort: $50  Disney’s Yacht Club Resort: $75  Cabins at Disney’s Ft. Wilderness Resort: $50  Hotels have increasingly been welcoming their guests’ canine friends, and it’s not unusual for them to charge fees for them. Resorts also typically have “resort fees” that cover amenities such as swimming pool use and Wi-Fi.  Still, the dogs are getting their perks. The properties will offer a Pluto’s Welcome Kit. Inside is a mat, bowls, a pet ID tag, plastic disposable bags, puppy pads, and dog walking maps. Rooms will have a Pluto “Do Not Disturb” door hanger so staff will know that there is a dog in the room.  And soon: pet merchandise will be available at four Walt Disney World Resort properties.	1

So exactly what led Renée Zellweger, an Oscar-winning actress, to make her big return to Hollywood in the role of a prophetic housewife in a hackneyed family drama? Well, one theory is that she was desperate for work, which is a lousy position for a star who was once so highly employable to be in. So, accepting whatever middle-aged lady roles she was offered may have made the difference for Zellweger between seeing screen time or not — even if they aren't the kind of movies that would make for an amazing mid-life career renaissance.  There's also a chance Zellweger's just not all that interested in Hollywood anymore, especially when you consider the fact that she disappeared almost as quickly as she reappeared after Bridget Jones' Baby came and went. If that's the case, then we say: Do your thing, Renée! Still, we have our suspicions that Zellweger will break out onto the acting scene once more when the time is right…	1
"The first televised Christmas Message, broadcast in 1957  The Queen's Christmas Message (also known as The King's Christmas Message in the reign of a male monarch, formally as Her Majesty's Most Gracious Speech[1]) is a broadcast made by the sovereign of the Commonwealth realms to the Commonwealth of Nations each Christmas. The tradition began in 1932 with a radio broadcast by King George V on the British Broadcasting Corporation's Empire Service. Since 1952, the message has been read by Elizabeth II; today, it is broadcast on television, radio, and the Internet via various providers.  History [ edit ]  The idea for a Christmas message from the sovereign to the British Empire was first proposed by the ""founding father"" of the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC), John Reith, in 1922 when he approached King George V about making a short broadcast on the newly created radio service. The King declined, however, believing that radio was mainly an entertainment.[2] Reith approached the King again ten years later, in 1932,[3] as a way to inaugurate the Empire Service (now the World Service) and the King finally agreed after being encouraged to do so by Queen Mary[2] and Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald.[4] That year, George V read the first Royal Christmas Message; the King was originally hesitant about using the relatively untested medium of radio, but was reassured after a summertime visit to the BBC and agreed to carry out the concept and read the speech from a temporary studio set up at Sandringham House.[5] The broadcast was introduced from Ilmington Manor by 65-year-old Walton Handy, a local shepherd, with carols from the church choir and the bells ringing from the town church, and reached an estimated 20 million people in Australia, Canada, India, Kenya, South Africa, and the UK.[5]  While his brother, Edward VIII, abdicated just before his first Christmas as king, George VI continued his father's Christmas broadcasts; it was in his 1939 reading delivered in the opening stages of the Second World War that he uttered the famous lines: ""I said to the man who stood at the Gate of the Year.""[6]  For many years, the King's speech came at the end of an hour-long broadcast of greeting from various parts of the British Empire and Commonwealth which typically included interviews with ordinary people of many occupations such as an innkeeper in an English village, a minder in South Africa, and a lifeguard in Australia with the King's speech serving as a bond tying the Commonwealth together.[2]  George's daughter, Elizabeth II, gave her first Christmas message to the Commonwealth of Nations from her study at Sandringham House, at 3:07 PM on 25 December 1952, some 11 months after her father's death. By 1957, the broadcast became televised,[7] and, from then until 1996, was produced by the BBC; only in 1969 was no message given because a special documentary film, Royal Family, had been made during the summer in connection with the investiture of the Prince of Wales. It was therefore decided not to do a broadcast at Christmas, but the Queen issued a written message instead.  The Queen ended this monopoly, however, announcing that the message would, from 1997, be produced and broadcast alternately by the BBC and its main rival, Independent Television News (ITN), with a biennial rotation.[8] It was reported by The Daily Telegraph that this decision was made after the BBC decided to screen an interview with Diana, Princess of Wales, on its current affairs programme Panorama.[9] This was denied by Buckingham Palace which said the new arrangements ""reflect the composition of the television and radio industries today"".[10] Beginning in 2011, Sky News was added to the rotation.[10]  Sky News recorded the Queen's Christmas message for Christmas 2012, the Queen's Diamond Jubilee year, and for the first time it has been recorded in 3D.[11] Buckingham Palace are reported to have explained: ""We wanted to do something a bit different and special in thi"	0
Women have long been kept silent by a system that often shames those who have experienced harassment and sexual misconduct. Moore stepping up for a younger actress is exactly the type of ally-ship we all want to see. In the era of the # MeToo and Time's Up movements , it’s important for actresses to see from older role models that they have agency in a male-dominated industry known for a culture of abuse. Vikander is one of the many actresses, including Natalie Portman and Reese Witherspoon , who signed the Time’s Up initiative. Speaking to Vogue, Vikander said she feels it has brought the community of women in Hollywood closer together.	1

    First comes R&R, then comes baby! Pregnant Serena Williams and her fiancé, Alexis Ohanian, relaxed on a babymoon in Mexico over the weekend.  Cutest Celebrity Baby Announcements  The tennis champ, 35, and her hubby-to-be, 34, soaked up the sun on Friday, April 21. Williams glowed in a paisley-printed one-piece swimsuit as she laughed alongside the Reddit founder.

For their next day at the beach, Williams opted for a red and orange printed one-piece and jean shorts.

Quickest Celebrity Engagements Ever  Speaking at a TED conference in Vancouver on Tuesday, April 25, Williams told Gayle King that she posted the snap on accident. “On social media you press the wrong button and…30 minutes later I missed four calls and I’m like, ‘That’s weird.’”  The athlete explained that she’s been documenting her pregnancy in pics for herself and that she didn’t mean to share the “20 weeks” snap.

Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Khloé Kardashian “went ballistic” when she found out her NBA baby daddy, Tristan Thompson, had played away with an Instagram model while he was in New York last weekend with the Cleveland Cavaliers.  A source close to the Kardashian family said pregnant Khloé, who is due to give birth to their daughter any day now, “was devastated when she saw the pictures of Tristan with that girl, she went absolutely ballistic at him. She is not only hurt, she is humiliated and worried for their child. How could he do this, and so publicly, when their baby daughter could arrive within a week?”  Nine-months-pregnant Khloé had remained at home in Cleveland while Thompson, whom she has been dating since 2016, traveled to New York last weekend ahead of the Cavs’ game against the Knicks at Madison Square Garden on Monday.  But, in photos obtained by Page Six on Tuesday, the baller was seen at his five-star hotel with Bronx Instagram model Lani Blair on Saturday.  Blair, who is also said to be a strip club bartender and bottle service waitress, spent four hours at Thompson’s hotel, The Four Seasons — according to witnesses — before they headed out together to private members club Soho House in the Meatpacking District on Saturday night.  Thompson and Blair were photographed returning together to his hotel at 5 a.m. Sunday. Blair was seen emerging hours later, at 8 p.m. Sunday, wearing the same clothes she’d had on the night before and clutching an overnight bag.  Online video also circulated of Thompson and Blair apparently kissing at a daytime party earlier Saturday at NYC rooftop hotspot PH-D. A source added to Page Six, “Apparently Tristan and Lani spent a lot of time together over the weekend.”  The Kardashian family has remained unusually silent on social media since the scandal broke on Tuesday, and their reps have not responded to requests for comment. Khloé’s personal rep has also not commented.  But a family source said that the Kardashians were not completely surprised by Thompson’s antics. “The truth is that he has a bad reputation, they had warned Khloé about him, he’s done this before. But she didn’t want to hear it, she loves him.”  Thompson already has a child, a son, with his ex Jordan Craig, who was born after he started dating Khloé.  Khloé had posted a touching photo of her and the NBA star kissing on Monday with the sweet caption to their baby, “We are ready whenever you are little mama.” The photo, along with other loving shots of her and Thompson, remained up on her Instagram page as of Wednesday.  Thompson is now back in Cleveland — and was believed to have been at home Tuesday when pictures emerged of him and the Instagram model — where the Cavaliers will face the Knicks again Wednesday night in the final game of the season.  Reps for the Cavaliers have not commented on behalf of Thompson, whose cheating sparked a massive backlash on social media.	0

Alec Baldwin's Donald Trump portrayal has certainly been popular with some factions and not with others, but it's safe to say that is should live on as an example of a classic Saturday Night Live character for some time to come. So, even though Alec Baldwin is only making $1,400 bucks to show up to practice and plan for each new Trump-based sketch, plus to perform during that inconvenient late night airing on Saturday night, he's certainly earning brownie points in other places. We're still talking about Tina Fey's Sarah Palin impression years and years later. Anticipate the same thing will happen for Alec Baldwin and Trump--especially if he continues the impression during the duration of Donald Trump's new gig.	0
"We may have come full circle to the aughts when it comes to fashion trends, but one reunion that won't be happening anytime soon is between Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan . One month after Hilton revealed that Lohan will not be invited to her upcoming wedding with Chris Zylka, explaining ""If you don't have anything nice to say, don't say anything at all,"" Hilton has become more specific about her issues with Lohan.  The heiress called the actress a ""pathological liar"" on Instagram after the fan account @paris2000s posted a few old videos of Lohan talking about their relationship. The videos, taken in 2006, show Lohan exhibiting conflicting feelings about Hilton. In one clip, Lohan says, ""This is a video that Paris Hilton... and I'm saying this on tape... she hit me last night, for no reason, apparently at my friend's house and I didn't know she'd be there. She hit me; she hit me with a drink and poured it all over me and it hurts and it's not okay.""  In another video, though, the pair are still together. As Hilton is getting into a car, she shouts at Lohan who is approaching the vehicle, ""Lindsay, tell them the truth,"" to which Lohan replies, ""Paris is my friend,"" Lohan says, ""She's a nice person. Please leave us alone...she never did that, she's a good girl.""  Then, in another clip, Lohan calls Paris a ""c-nt,"" before a friend of her whispers something to the actress and Lohan clarifies her stance, saying, ""I never said that. Paris is my friend. I love her. I’ve known her since I was 15 years old.”  Loading View on Instagram  Hilton left her own opinion in the comments section of the video, which was posted with the caption, ""The chronicles of the '00s troubled star Lindsay Lohan and her chaotic backtracking situations,"" writing, simply, ""#pathologicalliar.""  It's worth noting that 2006 was the year Lohan and Hilton's rumored feud began, after a video of Hilton laughing at their mutual friend Brandon Davis calling the actress a ""fire crotch"" went viral. Last month, Hilton clarified their current relationship status, saying, ""I don't have any drama with anyone but I choose to not surround myself with certain people. Life is too short.""  Pinterest © Instagram  Lohan is more or less attempting to do the same as she has stepped away from the spotlight to work on a film with an all-female team in Saudi Arabia. (She's currently based in Dubai.) Lohan recently reflected on how much life has changed since the aughts, telling W , “It’s [called] an iPhone. We didn’t have Instagram.… It would have been a lot calmer for me. When you think about it, paparazzi are not as crazy as they used to be when I used to be in New York. Now I can just [take a picture] before I walk out the door and then there is no story. It’s good, but it’s a little in-genuine."" One thing about that does seem to be genuine: her and Hilton's feud.

Beyoncé is on a roll. The music legend shut down the Grammys tonight when she arrived midway, joining husband Jay-Z in the audience, and given her gown, it was easy to see why. Dressed in all black by Nicolas Jebran and accented by a single white rose, the star smartly capped off a week filled with great looks chosen with her stylist, Marni Senofonte. Though the visual appeal of her latest look is instantly clear, the story behind it may come as a surprise.  According to Jebran, the inspiration for the dress was rooted in the traditions of social justice. “The idea was to create a moment, a memorable design with meaning because it’s more than just a gown,” shared the designer via email from Paris. After he was contacted by Senofonte to create a custom piece for the event, Jebran sought to innovate. Though he’s worked with Beyoncé and her team in the past, creating one of a kind looks for appearances at the Video Music Awards and other events, the 2018 Grammys required something special.      1 / 4 Chevron Chevron Photo: Getty Images  Citing the 1960s Black Panther movement as a reference point—one that Beyoncé has revisited multiple times, from her Super Bowl 50 performance to Lemonade—Jebran aimed to capture the spirit of vitality with his creation. It took more than 100 hours to craft the lengthy black velvet gown from start to finish, and Jebran and his team focused on including elements that embodied strength. “I love the dramatic slits and touches of sheer [fabric],” said Jebran, who kept the details unexpected throughout. “My favorite element [was] the bold, broad shoulders because they symbolize power.”  With its thigh-high slits, crystal embellishment, and oversize fascinator, the look was an arresting grand finale to the series of outfits Beyoncé has worn throughout Grammys weekend. Accessorized with Lorraine Schwartz jewels and a pair of cat-eye shades from Alain Mikli, it hit all the right notes. Making waves at Roc Nation’s pre-Grammys brunch yesterday, she pulled out a custom metallic navy Ralph & Russo gown with layers of Lorraine Schwartz diamonds before switching it up at Clive Davis’s gala that same night in a ruffled black silk crepe and velvet number by Azzi and Osta couture. It came complete with a transparent skirt that showed off her sculpted legs and an aptly named 'Carter' beret by Eugenia Kim.  Three statement gowns in less than 24 hours might sound like a lot of looks, but for the designers behind each outfit, nothing beats the Queen Bey seal of approval. “We feel so many emotions but most importantly [we’re] honored. We are filled with happiness and love seeing her smile and glow wearing our design,” said Assaad Osta. The sentiment was echoed by Jebran, who still has a “pinch me” moment no matter how many times he designs for the superstar: “Although I’ve dressed Beyoncé in the past, each time still feels like the first—I am honored that she feels confident in my designs.”  See every look from the 2018 Grammy Awards red carpet:	1

"American television series  This article is about the television show. For the video game genre, see Dating sim  The Dating Game is an ABC television show. It first aired on December 20, 1965 and was the first of many shows created and packaged by Chuck Barris from the 1960s through the 1980s. ABC dropped the show on July 6, 1973, but it continued in syndication for another year (1973–1974) as The New Dating Game. The program was revived three additional times in syndication afterwards. The first revival premiered in 1978 and ran until 1980, the second ran from 1986 until 1989, and the last ran from 1996 until 1999 with a season of reruns following.  Jim Lange hosted The Dating Game for its entire ABC network run and the 1973 and 1978 syndicated editions. The 1986 revival was hosted by Elaine Joyce for its first season and Jeff MacGregor for its remaining two seasons. When the show was revived with a different format in 1996, Brad Sherwood was named as its host. Chuck Woolery took over in 1997 after he left The Home and Family Show when the original format was reinstated and hosted for the last two seasons.  Beginning in 1966, The Dating Game was often paired with The Newlywed Game. This was especially true when the two shows entered syndication; in fact, in 1996 the revivals of both The Dating Game and The Newlywed Game were sold as a package called ""The Dating-Newlywed Hour"".  The program was originally broadcast in black-and-white, but when a prime-time version began in October 1966, both it and the daytime version were broadcast in color; the daytime version thus became the first ABC daytime series to be broadcast in color on a regular basis.  Format [ edit ]  Typically, a bachelorette would question three bachelors, who were hidden from her view; at the end of the questioning period, she would choose one to go out with on a date paid for by the show. Occasionally, the roles would be reversed with a man questioning three ladies; other times, a celebrity would question three players for a date for themselves or for a co-worker or a relative of theirs.  Before becoming famous, Farrah Fawcett, Suzanne Somers, Yvonne Craig, Lindsay Wagner, Leif Garrett, Tom Selleck and Lee Majors appeared as contestants on the show in the 1960s and early 1970s. Other contestants who appeared before becoming famous included The Carpenters, Jackson Bostwick, Michael Richards, Joanna Cameron, Andy Kaufman (who went under the pseudonym Baji Kimran), Steve Martin, Burt Reynolds, John Ritter, Phil Hartman, Jennifer Granholm (Governor of Michigan from 2003–2010), Arnold Schwarzenegger, and Alex Kozinski.[1] Serial killer Rodney Alcala's episodes were shown during his murder spree and after he had been convicted of assault in California.  Some contestants appeared even after they were fairly well known, including a young Michael Jackson, Dusty Springfield, Ron Howard, Maureen McCormick, Barry Williams, Sally Field, Richard Dawson, Jay North, and Paul Lynde.  One standard trademark was that at the end of each episode, the host and winning contestants would blow a kiss to the viewers.  Game play [ edit ]  Original version [ edit ]  Generally the bachelorette would ask questions written in advance on cards to each of the three hidden bachelors. The same question could be asked to multiple bachelors. This continued until time ran out. The bachelorette would make her choice based solely on the answers to her questions. Occasionally, the contestant was a bachelor who would ask questions to three bachelorettes. Certain kinds of questions were ""off-limits"", such as name, age, occupation, and income.  When the original format returned to the syndicated revival in 1997, these rules were readopted but there was more of a variety between bachelors and bachelorettes.  1996–97 season [ edit ]  For the first season of the 1996 revival, The Dating Game used a different format. A notable change was that the prospective bachelor/bachelorette knew what the first names o"	1
On Wednesday, HBO CEO Richard Plepler said his HBO Now streaming video on demand service has “about 800,000” paying subscribers. Those come in addition to the viewers who watch HBO on an ancient platform known as TV.  We figured this was as good a time as any to update comparisons among the existing streaming options. So here they are, with pretty pictures and variably pretty statistics:  HBO Now  Like Plepler said, the SVOD option for HBO currently has “about” 800,000 paying subscribers after eight months of existence. That’s a lower figure than Wall Street analysts wanted to see, but the service has yet to land on Xbox and PlayStation platforms. The two video game consoles account for about 20 percent of sister app HBO Go’s viewing.  Of course, HBO and Cinemax still do the vast majority of their business on cable — which people in the industry call “linear” viewing, a term that also applies to broadcast TV. A person with knowledge of the numbers told TheWrap that combined totals between the two channels are “approaching 50 million domestic” subscribers. Add in 81 million more paid users internationally, and one can understand why parent company Time Warner appreciates the traditional model.  Read more details on the current state of HBO Now here.  Also Read: HBO Now Has 'About 800,000' Paying Subscribers, CEO Confirms  Hulu  Right around the previous television upfronts season, Hulu revealed that it had about 9 million paying subscribers. However, a lot has happened since April 2015, and we don’t just mean a long 10 months passing.  Since that number, Hulu has not only added a ton of content, it’s changed subscription options. The 9 million count came about at a time when the service only offered an $8-per-month plan, with which subscribers still had to watch commercials. In September, Hulu rolled out a $12 monthly subscription option that removes the ads.  The company plans to publicly update its subscriber total sometime this year, but all Hulu told TheWrap today was, “Our subscriber base has continued to grow since then.”  It’s important to note here that Hulu is only meaningfully active in the United States, unlike …  Also Read: Time Warner's Q4 HBO Growth Can't Offset Company's Box Office Sales Drop  Netflix  The big boy of them all, Netflix boasts a massive 70.1 million paid subscriptions worldwide. In the U.S., the company’s 43.4 million paid subscribers is pushing five-times Hulu’s count.  Netflix still does not release viewership information, though it claims “Orange Is the New Black” would be the top show across pay-TV if it did. San Francisco-based Symphony Advanced Media has claimed it can accurately measure Netflix’s viewing, and that the numbers aren’t nearly as impressive as Ted Sarandos and Reed Hastings would like us all to believe. Those two guys say the claim — and Symphony A.M.’s data — is hogwash.  Also Read: 'Fuller House' Trailer Brings the 'Full House' Gang Back Together (Video)  Amazon Prime  Amazon keeps a lid on its figures too, though it has thrown around the phrase “tens of millions” in the past. That said, many — or probably most — of Amazon’s Prime subscribers don’t even watch the TV shows and movies. They just want free two-day shipping on paper towels.

"Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna's relationship drama has escalated to new heights.  Chyna was granted a temporary restraining order on Monday, days after Kardashian posted explicit photos of her and accused her of cheating and stealing money from him. He claimed Chyna had their daughter, 7-month-old Dream, out of spite and her alleged drug addiction and alcoholism inhibited her from being a suitable mother.  Kardashian, of ""Keeping Up with The Kardashians"" reality show fame, took to social media to list a series of issues with his former fiancée Chyna, who operates a make-up line called ""Lashed by Blac Chyna.""  BLAC CHYNA, ROB KARDASHIAN AT RISK OF LOSING CUSTODY OF DAUGHTER DREAM?  Chyna, with her lawyer Lisa Bloom, said in her first on-camera interview Monday that she felt ""betrayed"" by Kardashian and she was seeking legal actions because though her ex doesn't respect her, he has ""to respect the law.""  The formerly engaged couple have had plenty of break ups, make ups and social media rants. Here's a timeline of their relationship.  January 2016: Kardashian and Chyna begin dating  The couple's relationship was made public after Chyna posted a now-deleted photo on Instagram of her cuddling in Kardashian's arms. But even then there was drama -- especially with the Kardashian clan. At the time, Kylie Jenner was dating rapper Tyga, who used to date Chyna and is the father to their son King.  Chyna was also Kim Kardashian's former friend, but the relationship fell apart when Jenner began dating Tyga.  February and March 2016: Kardashian aims for healthier lifestyle, break-up rumors surface  Chyna fueled engagement rumors after posting a photo of a massive diamond ring on her ring finger. Those rumors were quickly squashed, but the relationship seemed to be a turning point for Rob Kardashian. He remained mostly out of the spotlight for years after battling depression and weight gain.  Kardashian, however, appeared to be starting a healthier lifestyle, People Magazine reported.  ""Rob has fallen hard for Blac Chyna. She makes him super happy and this is the first time that he’s felt so optimistic about life in years,"" a source told the magazine.  But a month later, Kardashian sparked break-up rumors after deleting all photos with Chyna from his Instagram. Chyna also posted a meme with the caption: ""When you just get out of a relationship & your hoe friend welcomes you back into the World of Hoe.""  Chyna and Kardashian, though, were then seen taking trips and making club appearances together.  April 2016: The couple announces their engagement  Amber Rose, Chyna's best friend, confirmed the couple's engagement on Instagram.  ""Congratulations to my Family @blacchyna and @robkardashian!!! 💍💍💍Pease don't let nothing or no one tear u guys apart! I never seen my sis so happy and I couldn't be more happy for her! Sometimes we find love in the strangest places 😉 Lol God Bless you 2! Now let's get this wedding together so y'all can start making some babies 👼🏽👼🏽👼🏽👼🏽 #TrueLove #putaringonitsouknowitsreal,"" Rose wrote in her post.  The ring seemed to be the same one Chyna was seen wearing in February.  May 2016: Chyna announces she is pregnant  Chyna announced she was pregnant with the couple's first child in an Instagram post. The photo showed her in ""emoji"" form wrapping her hands around her belly.  Summer 2016: Another break-up?  Break-up rumors continued to swirl. In July, Kardashian deleted all his photos and unfollowed Chyna with no explanation. It was later revealed in their E! reality show, ""Rob & Chyna,"" which aired from September to December 2016, that Kardashian and Chyna got into an ""explosive fight.""  By September, the pair were again spotted going on date nights and trying to work out their relationship. Chyna was about seven months pregnant.  November 2016: Dream Renee Kardashian is born  The couple welcomed their daughter to the world on Nov. 10. This is the first child for Kardashian and the second for Chyna.  December 2016: Anoth"	1

"Following a Thursday New York Times report that detailed decades of sexual harassment allegations, Harvey Weinstein has been fired from the production company and distributor he cofounded, The Weinstein Company board said in a statement released Sunday.  ""In light of new information about misconduct by Harvey Weinstein that has emerged in the past few days, the directors of The Weinstein Company have determined, and have informed Harvey Weinstein, that his employment with The Weinstein Company is terminated, effective immediately,"" the statement read.  With Harvey Weinstein Out, The Weinstein Company Faces Serious Business Challenges  The Times' investigation reported that Weinstein, 65, has reached at least eight settlements with women over allegations including sexual harassment and unwanted physical contact. Among those agreements was a reported $100,000 previously undisclosed settlement with actor Rose McGowan in 1997 following an incident in a hotel room during the Sundance Film Festival.  The article alleged a pattern of abuse of power, in which Weinstein repeatedly invited aspiring actresses to meet him in luxury hotel rooms. The report included allegations from eight women that Weinstein appeared naked or only partially clothed, asking for a massage or initiating one himself, or requiring them to be present while he bathed.  In a statement to The Times on Thursday, Weinstein said he would be taking leave from the company; the board announced he was on an indefinite leave of absence on Friday night. But a new sexual harassment allegation emerged late Friday, in which a news reporter alleged Weinstein masturbated in front of her a decade ago.  According to allegations reported by HuffPost, in 2007 Weinstein invited a woman to meet with him privately in a Cuban-themed restaurant, Cafe Socialista, in Manhattan, before exposing himself and masturbating in front of her. The woman, Lauren Sivan, was a reporter at local cable channel Long Island 12 in New York at the time; she is currently an anchor for a Los Angeles-based Fox TV station. Sivan and a Fox TV representative did not respond to a request for comment.  Even with Weinstein out, The Weinstein Company faces a very tough road ahead. So far, four of the nine members of its all-male board have resigned since the accusations were made public. Milwaukee Bucks co-owner Marc Lasry, Technicolor deputy CEO Tim Sarnoff and Ziff Capital Partners financier Dirk Ziff reportedly resigned from the board on Friday. Hedge fund billionaire Paul Tudor Jones resigned on Saturday, according to a representative.  Now under the leadership of Harvey's brother and co-chairman, Bob Weinstein, and COO, David Glasser, the company is launching an internal investigation into the investigation, which could be very costly.  ""These investigations, if done thoroughly, can be extremely expensive, in the range of $20 million to $40 million, given that the allegations span three decades, two continents, and involve potentially dozens of individuals,"" said Debra Katz, a partner with Katz, Marshall & Banks, who has worked on similar cases.  It's unclear whether the privately-held company is currently profitable or how much cash on hand it has to handle such expenses, but any new financing will be difficult to secure.  ""It's going to be much more expensive to raise money for projects, whether it's debt or equity, and it'll be more difficult to attract high level projects for now,"" said Hal Vogel, a longtime media analyst and founder of Vogel Capital Management, to Forbes.  In recent years, the company had been investing further in television, releasing and distributing fewer movies as it sought to build its TV division in the hopes of selling it. But any potential sale, which was first touted in 2014 and seemingly rekindled this year, now faces an uncertain future.  The Weinstein brothers hold a 42% stake in the company.

Taylor Swift’s groping trial officially ended Monday after she won her countersuit against former DJ David Mueller, who was found guilty of inappropriately touching the singer during a 2013 meet-and-greet. Following four hours of deliberations, the jury unanimously decided Mueller assaulted Swift and awarded her $1.  As Gossip Cop reported, Mueller’s lawsuit against Swift was dismissed Friday after a judge decided there was insufficient evidence to suggest she caused him to get fired from his radio hosting gig. The former DJ had filed a $3 million lawsuit against the singer, claiming she falsely accused him of grabbing her butt while posing for a photo backstage at one of her 2013 concerts, leading to his wrongful termination from a radio station. The judge ultimately decided that Swift wasn’t legally responsible for Mueller losing his job, but the jury could still find her mom Andrea and radio liaison Frank Bell liable.  The trial continued Monday to address those remaining claims, as well as the singer’s countersuit against Mueller for assault and battery. As Gossip Cop noted, Swift countersued for just one dollar as her lawsuit was filed to raise awareness about sexual assault, as opposed to financial gain. Swift reportedly broke down into tears as lawyers on both sides presented their closing arguments earlier today, the sixth day of the trial.  Mueller’s attorney, Gabriel McFarland, reportedly held up the photo of Swift and his client during his closing statements and asked the jury if the smiling singer looked like she’d just been assaulted. Swift’s lawyer, Douglas Baldridge, shot back during his closing argument that there’s no logical reason his client would make up a story about Mueller grabbing her butt. Baldridge stated, “[Mueller] can’t take responsibility for what he is doing,” before calling the former DJ’s lawsuit “shameful and cowardly.”  Following the closing statements, the eight-person jury consisting of two men and six women exited the court and began to deliberate for four hours. In the end, they unanimously determined Mueller groped Swift and awarded her the $1. In addition, the jurors found that Swift’s mom and Bell both did not do anything improper to interfere with Mueller’s employment. It was a complete victory for Swift’s camp, and a total loss for Mueller.	0
"Get the biggest celebs stories by email Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  Kim Kardashian has been sent into a tail spin over her husband Kanye West's bizarre meltdown on a TMZ live stream - and is concerned about what it means for her reputation.  Kanye appeared in the TMZ offices on Tuesday and let slip a number of bizarre claims - including that he's addicted to drugs after getting plastic surgery.  He also sparked fury across the world by claiming being a slave was ""a choice"" and gushing over US president Donald Trump.  In the jaw-dropping rant, Kanye claimed: ""I was drugged the f**k out, bro, I was on opioids and I was addicted to opioids.  ""Two days after I got off opioids, I [screeching noise] I'm in the hospital. I had plastic surgery, I got liposuction for y'all, because I didn't want y'all to call me fat, like y'all called Rob [Kardashian] at the wedding, and made him fly home before me and Kim got married.""  Kanye then went into a spiel about how a friend had told him to stop popping the pills because ""they kill genius"", but doctors upped his dose from two tablets a day to seven while he was in hospital.  ""The reason why I dropped those tweets and everything, because I was drugged the f**k out, bro,"" he yelled while facing the TMZ newsroom.  ""These pills that they want me to take three of a day, I take one a week maybe, two a week. Y'all have me scared of myself, of my vision. So I took some pills, so I wouldn't go to hospital and proof everyone right.  ""We are drugged out. We are following other people's opinions. We are controlled by the media, and today it all changes.""  It's thought the medication Kanye is referring to are necessary to keep him balanced - but TMZ reports his team are concerned he's not taking the right dosage.  Instead, Kanye seems to be self-regulating his intake, meaning his doctors aren't sure what is or isn't working.  (Image: Splash News)  And the stress of the situation is taking its toll on Kim, who had to frantically disassociate herself from Kanye's string of tweets praising Donald Trump last week.  ""Kim isn't mad about [the Trump] tweets,"" a source tells Us Weekly, ""but she's worried that people will think she shares the same views.  ""She was worried if she stayed silent, fans would take it as her not having an opinion or agreeing with him.""  The insider added: ""They've always had their own opinions and been their own people. This is the Kanye that Kim has always known.""  (Image: Instagram)  Kanye's views on slavery, in particular, caused outrage during his rant.  ""When you hear about slavery for 400 years, for 400 years, that sounds like choice,"" he told the presenters of TMZ Live.  ""You was there for 400 years, and it's all of y'all? Do you feel like I'm thinking free and feeling free?"" he asked.  Presenter Van Lathan shot back: ""I actually don't think you're thinking anything.""  Kanye later clarified his remarks on Twitter.  ""The reason why I brought up the 400 years point is because we can't be mentally imprisoned for another 400 years,"" he wrote.  ""We need free thought now. Even the statement was an example of free thought ... It was just an idea."""	0
"Taylor Swift has made it clear she's not messing around with gossip anymore. Reputation is coming out on Nov. 10, at midnight, and the days leading up to the album's release have been packed with new content from Swift revealing things like the Reputation tracklist, behind-the-scenes videos highlighting the creation of the album, and now, the back covers of the Reputation magazines that are available at Target when you buy the album. And Taylor Swift's Reputation magazine covers prove she's trolling all of us with this album release.  On Wednesday, Nov. 8, Swift tweeted two photos that are apparently the back covers of the Reputation magazines that will be available come tomorrow, Nov. 10. Her tweet said,  Forgot to show the back of the Target magazines on Friday you can get your hands on this quality reading material.  The covers themselves say things like ""WHO IS OLIVIA'S REAL FATHER?"" and ""CATITUDE! MEREDITH IS OUT OF CONTROL!"" In case you didn't know, Olivia and Meredith are Swift's two cats named after Olivia Benson from Law & Order: SVU and Meredith Grey from Grey's Anatomy. This is expert trolling, if I do say so myself. The magazine covers show Swift making fun of tabloid coverage of her over the years while also making fun of herself. The magazines themselves will reportedly feature poems written by Swift as well as photos from her Reputation photo shoot.  I can't lie. They're pretty funny.  Swift is really going gung-ho with this whole ""F the media"" angle with Reputation.  Is this angle about the ~dishonest media~ pretty poorly/insensitively timed given the fact that the President of the United States actively tries to discredit one of the most important tenets of American democracy? One hundred percent. But look what we made her do!!  Swift's ""Call It What You Want"" lyrics highlight the emotional side of how done she is with tabloid gossip. The lyrics go:  My castle crumbled overnight, I brought a knife to a gunfight, they took the crown but it's alright. All the liars are calling me one, nobody's heard from me in months, I'm doing better than I ever was.  Cause my baby's fit like a daydream, walking with his head down, I'm the one he's walking to. So, call it what you want yeah, call it what you want to. My baby's fly like a jet stream, high above the whole scene, loves me like I'm brand new. So, call it what you want yeah, call it what you want to.  All my flowers grew back as thorns, windows boarded back up after the storm, he built a fire just to keep me warm. All the drama queens taking swings, all the jokers dressing up as kings, they fade to nothing when I look at him.  And I know I make the same mistakes every time, bridges burn, I never learn, at least I did one thing right, I did one thing right. I'm laughing with my lover, making forts under covers, trust him like a brother, yeah you know I did one thing right. Starry eyes sparking up my darkest night.  Cause my baby's fit like a daydream, walking with his head down, I'm the one he's walking to. So, call it what you want yeah, call it what you want to. My baby's fly like a jet stream, high above the whole scene, loves me like I'm brand new. So, call it what you want yeah, call it what you want to.  I want to wear his initial on a chain around my neck, not because he owns me, but 'cause he really knows me, which is more than they can say. I recall late November, holding my breath, slowly I said, ""You don't need to save me, but would you run away with me?"" ""Yes.""  Cause my baby's fit like a daydream, walking with his head down, I'm the one he's walking to. So, call it what you want yeah, call it what you want to. My baby's fly like a jet stream, high above the whole scene, loves me like I'm brand new. So, call it what you want yeah, call it what you want to.  Swift released the Reputation tracklist earlier this week, and it looks like the first half of the album is about her media reputation and the second half is about her relationship with Joe Alwyn.

The team behind Sony’s long-anticipated and highly secretive Venom has finally offered us a first look at Tom Hardy in the role of Eddie Brock, aka Venom.  The picture shows the Oscar-nominated actor as Brock working his job as a reporter, staying true to the comics. Hardy has explained his excitement for taking on the role, telling IGN at Brazil Comic Con, “I just wanted to say that I give you my word of honor that I’m going to do everything that I can to deliver the best Venom that I can possibly muster.”  Venom’s story distances itself from the Marvel Universe and instead offers a darker look at the iconic anti-hero. The film’s director, Ruben Fleischer, said the film is inspired by the 1992 limited series Venom: Lethal Protector and the 1995 five-issue comic Planet of the Symbiotes, both written by David Michelinie.  Venom: Lethal Protector follows Eddie’s story as he moves from New York to San Francisco after coming to an agreement with his nemesis, Spider-Man, while Planet of the Symbiotes examines Eddie’s relationship with his symbiote and the influence it has on him, resulting in a war between Venom and his allies and the symbiotes.  Filming on Venom has wrapped in Atlanta, but continues in San Francisco later this month. Fleischer, the director of Zombieland, promises a true look at one of Marvel’s most exciting, complex and mysterious characters. The director said at Brazil Comic Con, “I can promise you badass action, Venom’s dark humor, and I can also promise you an absolutely stunning performance by Tom Hardy.” The film also stars Oscar nominee Michelle Williams, Golden Globe nominee Riz Ahmed and Jenny Slate.  Venom arrives in theaters Oct. 5, 2018. See Hardy as Eddie Brock below.	1
"""Anna and I are sad to announce we are legally separating. We tried hard for a long time, and we’re really disappointed,"" Chris shared to Facebook at the time.  But apart from that bleak announcement, Pratt has never spoken publicly about the high-profile split - until now.  Happier times. Getty  ""Divorce sucks,"" Pratt told Entertainment Weekly. ""But at the end of the day, we've got a great kid who's got two parents who love him very much. And we're finding a way to navigate this while still remaining friends and still being kind to one another. It's not ideal, but yeah, I think both of us are actually probably doing better.""  Faris has previously opened up about the former couple's co-parenting arrangement, telling E! News in January: “I think the key is surrounding him with a lot of joy and happiness, which he has a ton of.”  The actress has also spoken about her new views on marriage after walking down the aisle twice.  “I need to figure out what the purpose is,” the 41-year-old explained on friend Dax Shepard's podcast. “Is it safety for your children? Is it convention? Is it so other people respect your relationship more?”  Faris added: “For me, I’m just not quite sure where it fits…I am a romantic. I believe in a partnership, I believe in companionship. I just don’t know if I believe in a ceremony of a wedding.”"	1

Tom Cruise received the devastating news last week that his mom, Mary Lee South, died at age 80 — and now a new report claims that his ex Katie Holmes decided to be there for the father of her child.  “Katie Holmes has reached out to her ex Tom Cruise to offer her condolences after the passing of his mother,” a source told Hollywood Life. “Tom has been rocked by the loss of his mother. They were very close and he will miss her dearly. He is staying strong and leaning on close friends and other family during this challenging time.”  MORE: Suri Cruise Is All Grown Up — See the Pic  (Photo Credit: Getty Images)  According to reports, Mary died peacefully in her sleep and was sent off with a Scientology ceremony. She was also the one who encouraged Tom to pursue an acting career.  Tom and Katie tied the knot in November 2006 and ended their marriage in August 2012. They are also parents to a 10-year-old daughter, Suri — though Tom hasn't seen her in quite some time.  “They used to Skype and text, but that trailed off drastically. He uses his film commitments as an excuse, but the truth is that doesn’t hold much weight with Suri anymore,” a source previously told In Touch. “Tom eats, breathes and sleeps Scientology. He’s disconnected from Katie, and then de facto from Suri, because of her connection to Katie. He hasn’t seen her since she was seven.”  (Photo Credit: Getty Images)  Katie moved on from the relationship with actor Jamie Foxx, and they were recently spotted spending New Year's Eve together in Miami.  “They’re very serious,” said a source.  Meanwhile, Tom was recently rumored to be dating a British woman.  MORE: Enter Here for Your Chance to Win a Trip to Miami  We think it's great that these two can still lean on each other in the most difficult times — and hope this could lead to him reconnecting with his daughter.  Our thoughts are with Mary's loved ones in the wake of this tragedy.	0
"Terry Crews publicly named for the first time the high-powered talent agent he claims groped him at an industry party and said he would ""not be shamed"" about the alleged assault.  ""Back in February 2016, I was assaulted by Adam Venit, who is head of the motion picture department at William Morris Endeavor, one of the biggest agencies in the world, period,"" Crews, 49, said today on ""Good Morning America."" ""He's connected to probably everyone I know in the business ... I did not know this man. I have never had a conversation with him, ever.""  Venit has represented stars such as Adam Sandler, Eddie Murphy, Sylvester Stallone, Diane Keaton, Liam Hemsworth and Steve Martin.  Charley Gallay/Getty Images  Crews was with his wife, Rebecca King-Crews, at the party last year when, he claims, Venit began making moves with his tongue at him.  ""I'm looking like, 'Is this a joke?' ... It was actually so bizarre,"" Crews said. ""He comes over to me. I stick my hand out, and he literally takes his hand and puts it and squeezes my genitals. I jump back like, 'Hey, hey.'""  Crews continued, ""And he's still licking his tongue out and all this stuff, and I go, 'Dude, what are you doing? What are you doing?' and then he comes back again. He just won't stop.""  Crews claims he then pushed Venit away from him, causing Venit to bump into other partygoers.  ""I have never felt more emasculated, more objectified. I was horrified,"" Crews said. ""It's so bizarre. I wake up every morning wondering, 'Did this really happen?'""  Venit did not respond to requests for comment from ABC News.  William Morris Endeavor told ABC News, ""Adam Venit was suspended following the internal investigation into the matter.""  Crews filed a police report Nov. 8 claiming to be a victim of a crime.  ""People need to be held accountable,"" he said. ""This is the deal about Hollywood. It is an abuse of power. This guy, again, he's one of the most powerful man in Hollywood, and he looked at me at the end as if, 'Who is going to believe you?'""  An LAPD spokesperson confirmed that Crews met with officers on Nov. 8 but would not elaborate on the nature of the meeting.  Crews, a star of ""Brooklyn Nine-Nine,"" fired William Morris as his agency one day after he filed the police report.  ABC  He went public with his account last month in a series of tweets, at the time identifying Venit only as ""a high level Hollywood executive.""  Crews said in one tweet that Venit called him to apologize but ""never really explained why he did what he did.""  This whole thing with Harvey Weinstein is giving me PTSD. Why? Because this kind of thing happened to ME.

""I put it in the back of my head, and I understood why women everywhere had to let it go,"" Crews said. ""When the Weinstein thing started happening, I got PTSD. I was going, 'Oh, my God, this exact thing happened to me. I understand why they won't come forward.'""

"Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez have ended their relationship once again, at least temporarily.  Reports have surfaced suggesting that the pair, who reunited in 2017 after nearly five years apart that was plagued with reconciliation rumors, are taking some time for themselves.  On March 11, 2018, Us Weekly reported that multiple sources confirmed the news of their split.  Rumors are swirling about the reasons for Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber's recent breakup  In addition to various reports about Justin and Selena's breakup itself, a number of different theories about their reason for taking time apart have surfaced. None have been confirmed by either pop star, but that's done little to quell the chatter among their respective fan bases.  So why did Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez call it quits this time?  Selena Gomez's mom, Mandy Teefey  During their second go at love, countless outlets reported that Selena Gomez's mom, Mandy Teefey, was less than thrilled that her daughter had decided to give supposedly-reformed bad boy Justin Bieber another chance.  Those theories have picked up steam in the wake of their alleged split.  A source told Us Weekly: 'It's been hard for her because she is super close with her mom. Her mom was her rock when she was having her health complications.'  However, People magazine's sources have refuted these claims.  'They have their own issues and are always on and off. She wouldn't base her relationship off what her mom thinks,' a source said.  So apparently Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez are on a break and all I can picture Justin singing ""What Do You Mean?"" — Maddie (@maddie_harper99) March 14, 2018  Selena Gomez's family  It's not just Mandy that's not on board with the Biebs. According to Us, Selena Gomez's entire family had qualms about her and Justin Bieber getting back together.  The source said: 'Justin's family loves Selena, but Selena's family has put her in a very conflicting spot because they still don't trust Justin.  'Selena has tried to convince her family that Justin has changed...but her family just isn't budging right now.'  E! shared a similar report, claiming 'family pressure' and other issues led to their breakup.  'She's on a break with Justin partly because of family pressure but also because of some issues surrounding his birthday,' a source said.  'She wanted to have a quiet birthday celebration with Justin and he wanted to go big and involve all of his church friends. They had a disagreement that didn't end well.'  jelena is fine. they hate the media and are doing everything they can to avoid it. and there’s nothing wrong with that because they have nothing to prove to anyone. stop being so negative and good night �� — . (@biebsftlife) March 15, 2018  Justin Bieber's attitude  Amid rumors that Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber called it quits, Us reported that Justin's attitude may have been a contributing factor in the demise of their rekindled romance.  '[He] doesn't care about anyone but himself,' a source said.  'The second she saw it, she walked away, especially now with her health. She knows she doesn't need him.'  Infidelity  A rumor is swirling among Justin and Selena fans on Twitter that Justin was unfaithful to Selena. Some seem to believe the once-troubled singer had something going on with Petra Collins, whom Selena recently unfollowed on Instagram.  That rumor hasn't been substantiated, however. Especially considering it appears Petra is spending time with newly-single Justin Theroux.  They didn't break up  While many outlets are reporting that Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber have definitely decided to take some time apart, others claim they're still going strong.  Entertainment Tonight maintains the duo are still dating, but that Selena is taking a little time for herself to avoid outside pressure that stems from all the attention the two get.

Saturday, April 18, 2015 by  What is a shirtdress, you ask? It’s literally exactly what it sounds like: a shirt that is long enough to be considered a dress. A typical shirtdress looks like a long button-down shirt, and you can either buy them that way or get creative and make your own out of an over-sized shirt.  Shirtdresses are casual and easy to wear, making them perfect for the warmer days of spring and summer. They’re versatile and can be easily dressed up or down, they have a very street-chic vibe going on, and there’s also something really sexy about them – they kind of look like you just rolled out of bed and forgot pants. IDK guys. That’s what they remind me of sometimes!  In all seriousness, a shirtdress, when styled right, looks very chic and cool and totally Pinterest-worthy. If you haven’t invested in a good one yet, I recommend you do so now – or, like I said, create your own with an over-sized shirt. Here are 20 style tips on how to wear a shirtdress to get you inspired:  1. Keep it simple with a denim shirtdress, a cute hat, and fun sneakers.  Source  2. Add a leather jacket to toughen up the look of a chambray dress.  Source  3. Keep things casual with a pair of slip-on sneakers.  Source  4. On chillier days, add sheer tights and combat boots.  Source  5. Not into showing off your legs? Wear a shorter shirtdress over skinny jeans. Add heels to keep the look streamlined.  Source  6. Don’t be afraid to mix prints. This patterned jacket looks cool with the striped dress because of the similar colors.  Source  7. Use a scarf instead of a belt to nip the shirtdress in at the waist.  Source  8.

"Get the biggest celebs stories by email Subscribe Thank you for subscribing We have more newsletters Show me See our privacy notice Could not subscribe, try again later Invalid Email  Mel B is said to have ended her turbulent marriage to Stephen Belafonte after a “moment of clarity” as she healed a 10-year family rift and lost her dad to cancer .  Sources claim the final straw for the former Spice Girl was a string of blazing rows over her £40million fortune.  Insiders who worked with Mel on her US TV shows said the split was no surprise as the couple spent most of their time “squabbling” and “bickering” amid accusations of affairs and flirting.  And the Mirror can reveal they spent half their marriage in therapy as they desperately tried to make things work.  A TV executive in Los Angeles said: “They started from the beginning when they realised they were very different people, who would argue and row.  (Image: Getty)  ""Their personalities were like fire and ice, one minute it was pure adoration and the next it was all-out war.  “It led to them having blow-out arguments non-stop. However, as they got further down the line, the stress of keeping things together proved too much.  ""The therapy prompted more fights and bitterness. Their connection by the end was all but burned out.”  Mel, 41, fell out with her family when they told her of their concerns over ­ Belafonte ahead of their 2007 wedding.  (Image: PA)  There were fears for her three years ago when she turned up for The X Factor panel one Sunday in the UK with bruises and scratches on her face and arms. Belafonte, 41, denied assaulting her.  As their relationship failed, Mel was reconciled with her family after dad Martin made a plea.  Earlier this month, she posted a snap of her and sister Danielle, 36, holding his hand after he lost a five-year battle with myeloma cancer.  Sources said Mel’s loss was compounded by a series of rows with her film producer hubby over cash.  (Image: Getty)  An insider said: “Ever since they got married, they have been plagued with ­problems. The writing has been on the wall for a while.  “Money was at the centre of many rows but Martin’s passing provided a moment of complete clarity for Mel.  “For the first time in a decade, she decided to put blood before water.  “Stephen was always coming up with business ideas which caused huge ­arguments. It is no secret her family didn’t like him and now she has reconnected with them, Mel is sorting out her life.  (Image: Getty)  ""She’s had enough of the chaos with Stephen. Her, the kids and her family come first.”  Belafonte referred to Mel’s family as “the cutoff crew” on Twitter after Martin reached out to her.

"http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/DeadArtistsAreBetter  ...not quite what we meant. (James Ensor, The Painting Skeleton)  — Thiessen's Law of Art ""The overwhelming prerequisite for the greatness of an artist is that artist's death.""  Advertisement:  The vast majority of shows that mention paintings will mention this trope at one point: Artists are never recognized until after they're dead. Though this has happened in many cases, there have also been been a great deal of painters, modern and classic, that have been recognized while still alive. Nor has the deceased been recognized immediately after his corpse hits the ground, as it seems to happen when this trope is in effect. (Historically, this has affected composers and writers far less than people assume. Shakespeare was successful during his lifetime, so was Beethoven. It stands to reason - only a few people would continue doing something for a long time without some kind of success. This is glaringly obvious for composers - of the top tier, only Bach and Tchaikovsky comes even remotely close to this trope, and they were still far from starving during their lifetimes.)  Advertisement:  In theory, the idea that dead artists are better may result from them dying at their peak: they don't have the time to taint their earlier successes with a Dork Age of divisive later works that fail to live up to the masterpieces (whether through being too different or more of the same).  In 99% of the cases where this trope is mentioned, one character, either the artist or an associate, will come up with the ""brilliant"" idea of spreading rumors of the artist's death, which immediately causes said artist's work to magically get the recognition that eluded it all these years. Of course, something inevitably goes wrong, the artist is found to be alive, and the status quo is restored. For some reason, fraud accusations are seldom made.  See also Vindicated by History, True Art Is Ancient, and Short-Lived Big Impact. When a musician's death or departure leads to their group doing better than before, it's an aversion of The Band Minus the Face. Many examples below also fall under Never Speak Ill of the Dead, in that some artists who became greatly celebrated after their death lived miserable and/or ridiculed lives before dying.  Advertisement:  As a Death Trope, all Spoilers will be unmarked ahead. Beware.  Examples:  Fictional examples  open/close all folders  Anime and Manga  The plot device with a faked death skyrocketing popularity and recognition is used in Galaxy Angel almost perfectly, although with a military officer instead of an artist. A similar thing happens in Cannon God Exaxxion, though in this case the people playing up the war hero's death actually believed he was dead at first. When it turns out he wasn't, rather than admitting their mistake, they decide to make it come true.  In Mega Man Star Force, Hyde is under the impression that people will not love his grim, macabre works of art until after he dies. This is a motive for his villainy in the first place, as he tries to find Mu to become immortal so that he may live to see people appreciate him. When this doesn't seem to be working out, he starts an art class for children to get them to appreciate the art when they grow older, but they all ignore him and simply come for the free food. Free food provided by Luna Platz at that, who is perhaps is his sole earnest student.  In one chapter of Pet Shop of Horrors, a has-been actor whose only success was a small role in a cult-classic sci-fi film dies of suicide by basilisk. At his funeral, people are already starting to speak of him as if he were a great actor whose immense talent was too quickly robbed from the world.  Manjimutt from Yo-Kai Watch uses this as an excuse for why he has no friends. It should be noted Manjimutt is already dead and is not even an actual artist.

Learning how to apply makeup isn't as simple as it seems—and watching complicated YouTube tutorials can only make you more confused. Does foundation go before or after concealer? Should you put your eyeshadow on first or last? The truth: It’s pretty much all up to personal preference. But after years of being a beauty editor and talking to makeup pros, I’ve found a layering technique that works perfectly for me. For example, I fill in my brows before putting on foundation, since it’s one of the most important steps in my full routine. (So if I’m rushing at the end of my makeup routine, at least my brows will be done.) I also put on setting spray before mascara because I’ve ruined one too many makeup looks with runny black streaks doing it the other way around.  I recommend this same application sequence to my girlfriends when I’m giving impromptu lessons in the bathroom before we go out, but don't worry—you can remove and add steps as you see fit. For instance, I spend more time in areas like brows and highlighter, but you might want to focus your efforts on your eye makeup. I also edit based on how much time I have. I only have five minutes? Then I’m priming, concealing, adding some blush and highlighter, and putting on a quick brow. If I’ve got an entire hour to prep, then I’m going all out. Really, you can customize this guide to fit your needs. Consider this a makeup beginner’s outline to layering your makeup, step by step.  Step 1: Moisturize or apply a primer.  Kardashian favorite Mario Dedivanovic says using a hydrating cream before makeup helps all the powders and products you apply on top sink into the skin, making your makeup look less cakey. Since I prefer a dewy makeup look, I spray my face with a mist like MAC Prep + Prime Fix+ ($26). Then I massage in an illuminating primer or oil like Farsali Unicorn Essence ($54). You don’t have to use a product that is marketed as a primer; any moisturizer will do.  Step 2: Fill in brows.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  I always start my makeup look with the most time-consuming element. For me, that’s my brows (others like to do eyeshadow first, but I’m pretty clueless when it comes to eye makeup). First, I use a pencil to fill in sparse areas with hairlike strokes. Currently I’m liking the Anastasia Beverly Hills Brow Wiz pencil ($21). I’ll stop here if I’m in a hurry. When I’m being extra, I add a powder or pomade to really define the ends of my brows, where there is basically no hair. For this, I use Kat Von D 24-Hour Super Brow Long-Wear Pomade ($19). Finally, I lock it all in with a gel, like It Cosmetics Brow Power Pomade ($24).  Step 3: Apply foundation.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  I don’t like to use a lot of foundation, which is why I follow makeup artist Faye Lauren’s rule of thumb: Focus on the areas you want to even out and leave the rest of the face foundation-free. So, I apply my foundation starting at the center of my face: Around my nose, the eyes, and on my forehead, but I leave the area around my jawline only lightly covered. This prevents me from getting brown makeup stains everywhere when I put my hands on my chin throughout the day (that’s my thinking pose). I like to use a sponge or brush to apply my foundation, because I hate having my fingers dirty with product.  Step 4: Cover dark spots with concealer.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  Carmen Williamson, a makeup artist at Joanna Czech Dallas, previously told SELF that the best way to layer on concealer is after foundation in order to make sure your makeup blends together and that you don’t overdo it. This method works best for me because I get the kind of brightening I need for my purplish-black dark circles. I use a shade that is a bit lighter than my foundation under my eyes. I also apply a little concealer to my lids to act as a primer for when I wear eyeshadow.  Step 5: Add eyeshadow.  Share via Pinterest Courtesy of Saba Karamouz  You know those Y	1

But many are wondering if they will ever walk down the aisle and how they will do it — so much so that a country singer has already offered to officiate their ceremony.  So what exactly are their marriage plans? Here are seven things to know, including the one country singer who wants to officiate the couple’s wedding.  1. Shelton might have dissed ex Miranda Lambert on Twitter  He fired off with these harsh words. | He fired off with these harsh words. | Blake Shelton via Twitter  Although Shelton and Stefani have been dating three years now, he might still have some resentful feelings for his ex-wife, Miranda Lambert. He tweeted, “Been taking the high road for a long time.. I almost gave up. But I can finally see something on the horizon up there!! Wait!! Could it be?! Yep!! It’s karma!!” on April 25.  So what could this be referring to? In Touch Weekly reports Lambert has moved on to dating Evan Felker who is still technically married to Staci Felker. Felker filed for divorce in February of 2018. He reportedly struck up his relationship with Lambert after the split.  “They’re figuring it out. It’s in the early stages; they’re still getting to know each other,” an insider said.

Bryan joked that Shelton needs to hurry up and get married  The artist wants to see them getting hitched. | Frazer Harrison/Getty Images The artist wants to see them getting hitched. | Frazer Harrison/Getty Images  Bryan thinks the couple getting hitched quickly would be best for Shelton.  “If Blake were smart, he would marry her before she goes to an optometrist,” he said according to ET. “Eve	0
Last night, in a moment of great TV serendipity, the finale of The Leftovers unspooled on HBO while the fifth chapter of the new Twin Peaks played out on Showtime. The Leftovers was the type of show that always kept me guessing, and not just as to the true nature of the Sudden Departure. With each passing episode, I could never be sure what I’d be getting from the show, whom I’d be spending time with, or where we’d be. It’s a quality that’s been jam-packed into the last three Sundays, when the aforementioned shows, plus American Gods, have all aired new episodes during the nine-o’clock hour. The original Twin Peaks cracked the door for this type of storytelling on TV, and The Leftovers kept that door open for the Peaks revival. It’s a cycle I feel the creators of both shows would appreciate—anybody else catch the Black Lodge vibes during the situation room scenes of “The Most Powerful Man In The World (And His Identical Twin Brother)”?—where Twin Peaks is now both influence on and successor to The Leftovers.  GIF: Twin Peaks, “The Return, Part 5”  Advertisement  The cosmic ballet… goes on: One show takes an elegant bow by letting the mystery be (though I choose to believe Nora); the other forges ahead by deepening its mystery. “The Return, Part 5” is a feast for anyone who treats their TV shows like puzzles to be solved, a modern phenomenon we can attribute as much to David Lynch and Mark Frost as we can Leftovers and Lost boss Damon Lindelof. From Constance’s autopsy in this episode, we learn that the headless corpse from Ruth Davenport’s apartment had Dougie’s wedding band inside its stomach—which is not the ring we saw slide off Dougie’s hand when he turned into an otherworldly BB in the Red Room. [UPDATE: The original draft of this article conflated Dougie’s wedding band with The Owl Cave ring.] Does that mean the corpse is the body of the real Dougie? And if that’s the case, does that mean there was a fourth party targeting our ill-fated insurance agent, in addition to Doppel-Cooper, the hoods who booby-trapped his car, and the other hoods who tripped the explosives? And if that’s the case, whoever these people are, they keep creating new Lynchian tableaux of horror within the banal: first the scene in Ruth’s bed and then this shot of the neighborhood kid running home, past a single, noticeable shot of flaming wreckage.  It’s hard to tell if that chunk of car (or whatever) wound up in the frame on purpose or by accident. As Emily L. Stephens reminds us in her latest review, one of Twin Peaks’ signature images—Bob in the mirror behind a screaming Sarah Palmer—was a happy accident, so I have to wonder about the creators intentionally sticking any clues to their mystery in the background. In fact, as much as there is to pick apart in “Part 5,” I think it thumbs its nose at the people watching the show as amateur sleuths. If you were looking for deeper meaning in Dr. Jacoby’s golden shovels, you might be disappointed to find out they’re an Alex Jones-style scam meant for the proper digging and depositing of excrement. And if you’re tracking any of the numbers that keep popping into frame, you’ll be similarly frustrated by “Part 5.” The episode begins with the message to the black box in Buenos Aires, Argentina (containing the numbers “159” and “2”), introduces the fact that Dougie worked for the Lucky 7 Insurance Company, then puts a big ol’ “$8.95” behind Shelly and Norma while Becky (Amanda Seyfried) counts her $72. But if you’re looking to unravel some sort of cipher from within the episode, you’re also going to run smack dab into the numerals from the “Order Now” screen in Dr. Amp’s Gold Shit-Digging Shovel commercial, and then the clock next to the elevator that Dougie’s co-workers shove Coop out of.  Advertisement  You think you’ve found your way through the maze, but then Twin Peaks throws up a bunch of dead ends. None of which is to say that there’s a right way and a wrong way to watch this, or any other show of its k	1

The choice for HollywoodLife.com’s Star of the Week this week is pretty obvious — who else could it be besides Harry Styles?! With new music, appearances and more, Harry was everywhere. Here’s why we picked him!  Harry Styles, 23, is having what’s sure to be one of the best weeks of his life…and HollywoodLife.com is naming him our Star of the Week because of it. The first reason, of course, is because of the release of his very first solo album, Harry Styles. Just a month and a half after he announced he’d be putting out solo music, Harry dropped his debut record, and it immediately soared to the top of the charts. Fans are going completely crazy over the album’s ten songs, and we couldn’t be prouder of the 23-year-old!  Aside from putting out a record, Harry also started doing solo public appearances to promote the music. Fans started lining up for his Today Show concert almost TWO full days in advance, and the crowd went on for SIX New York City blocks when he took the stage on May 9. Harry looked hotter than ever while performing “Sign of the Times,” “Carolina” and “Ever Since New York” for the crowd, and he totally proved he can own that stage, even without his One Direction band mates.  Obviously, it’s been a totally hectic few days for Harry — he was in New York for the first half of the week, then jetted back to London for the album release. Still, he’s made sure to stop and spend time with his fans, posing for selfies and chatting with his loyal supporters. He even sweetly sent pizza out to those waiting in the Today show line all night long. How cute is that?!  Things aren’t slowing down for Harry any time soon, either. He’ll be promoting his music for the next few weeks, and then his first movie, Dunkirk, is set to hit theaters on July 21. After the press run for that is over, he’ll have to start prepping for his tour in the fall. That tour, by the way, sold out in SECONDS when the tickets went on sale last week. GO HARRY GO!  [interaction id=”5915b588f5b27d4e18d6cb92″]  HollywoodLifers, do you think Harry is a good pick for Star of the Week?! What’s your fave thing he did this week?	0
This story about Kristen Bell, Ted Danson and “The Good Place” first appeared in the Comedy/Drama/Actors issue of TheWrap’s Emmy magazine.  Heaven or hell? Devil or angel? And does it even matter?  NBC’s delightful comedy series “The Good Place” started out as a vision of paradise, albeit a rather odd and completely secular paradise; it ended its first season with the show-shattering reveal that our human characters had actually been spending their time in a radical new version of hell designed to get them to torture each other rather than leaving that job to the pros.  And in Season 2, the show from “Parks and Recreation” creator Mike Schur kept upending itself in the most delicious of ways.  This is a show that can make hell kind of charming and give a fun, cuddly twist to the afterlife. Kristen Bell somehow makes us root for a woman whose self-obsession knows no bounds but who’s smarter and maybe even nicer than she lets on. Ted Danson was a scene stealer even in the first season as a human-torturing demon who had to hide his true nature from the other characters and from the audience.  (Granted, words like demon may not be appropriate for an altogether nonreligious and bureaucratic afterworld; he’s middle management at best, and not very good at his job of torturing humans.)  Also Read: 'Good Place' Creator Mike Schur Confirms Exactly Where Eleanor and the Gang Are in Season 3  On a break early in the filming of Season 3, Bell and Danson discussed the pleasures and challenges of a show that delights in blowing up its own premise over and over. (Warning: spoilers ahead.)  Season 2 must have been a real kick for you, Ted, because you finally got to…  TED DANSON Be who I am. Yeah, it was really fun. And it was easier to find the funny, because funny usually is this kind of triangular thing between you, another character and the audience. But I had no relationship to the audience in Season 1. They never saw me in a private moment, or I would have been twirling my mustache.  Would you have taken the part without the knowledge that eventually you were going to get to show who this guy really is?  DANSON Oh, I would have done it. I signed on before I saw a script. I knew that Kristen was likely going to do it. I then listened to Mike Schur empty his mind for an hour and tell me everything he knew about the show and the twist. And I really signed up for Mike Schur.  KRISTEN BELL He can tell a story with detail that is frightening, like a computer. “Here’s what I want to do in Episode 9, and it’s a callback to Episode 6…” And I’m like, “You haven’t even written the pilot, bro! Slow down!”  DANSON Is this the first job you’ve taken when you haven’t read a script?  BELL Yeah. Wow. Yeah. We were sold on the idea, with the twist, and with his commitment to cliff-hangers and pulling the rug out from under people. I just thought, “What a goal. Let him try, I’d love to be a part of it.”  Also Read: Kristen Bell Says 'Good Place' Set Really Is a Good Place - Thanks to 'No Jerks' Policy (Video)  I feel as if Ted needed to know the twist to play his part, but you didn’t.  DANSON But she needed to know in order to take the part.  BELL Well, yes and no. Mike is an unparalleled collaborator, and I think he had respect enough for me to say, “I would like you to know what you’re signing up for.” So he opened the whole kimono that day.  Was it frustrating to hide who this guy was, Ted?  DANSON I don’t know about frustrating, because I had my hands full just trying to fulfill the script. But watching it, I would go, “You’re either doing a really good job, Ted, or that’s some of the worst acting I’ve ever seen.” And I couldn’t quite make up my mind.  BELL Around Episode 8 of the first season, my husband [Dax Shepard] said, “I love your show, but my one critique is that Ted is just wildly underused. He’s just kind of one-note.” And I didn’t tell him the twist, because I can keep a secret.  DANSON [Silently mouths] I can’t.  Also Read: 'The Good Place	1
Kris, 61, and 36-year-old Corey haven’t been seen together in public since Valentine’s Day - and even then they hardly looked loved up.  ‘Corey was traipsing around behind Kris holding her handbag. It was like she barely registered he was there,’ says an eyewitness who spotted them out in LA.  In a blow to Kris’ ego, it’s believed that Corey, Justin Bieber’s former road manager, initiated their break-up.  ‘She had been nagging him about a number of things for a while, including the fact that he wasn’t spending as much time with her as she’d like, and he just couldn’t take it anymore,' says Star’s source, who adds that Kris is devastated.  ‘She can’t stand to be alone. But I suspect she and Corey may have actually put on a united front in public for some time, since ratings have been way down for Keeping Up With The Kardashians. Kris is obsessed with maintaining the impression that everything is wonderful.	0
    A few days after Chris Soules’ arrest for allegedly leaving the scene of a fatal car crash, police have obtained a search warrant for the results of his blood test, a law enforcement source tells Us Weekly.  The season 19 Bachelor, 35, was driving his pickup truck on Monday, April 25, when he rear-ended a tractor trailer. Soules called 911 and checked the victim’s pulse, but the tractor driver, Kenneth Mosher, later died as a result of his injuries. Hours later, Soules was arrested at his home in Arlington, Iowa.  According to TMZ, the search warrant allows police to obtain Soules’ blood test results from the hospital. However, the results may not be accurate, because when police arrived to arrest Soules, there was a delay while they obtained a search warrant to enter his home. “Chris did stay in his home and would not come out until the police provided a search warrant to enter his home,” the law enforcement source tells Us. (The Buchanan County Sheriff’s Office has no comment.)  He later went to a hospital for medical attention and a blood test. TMZ says police may be interested in the results to determine if alcohol or drugs were a factor in the accident. The site reported that Soules allegedly had alcoholic beverage containers in his possession at the time of the crash, but he was not charged with driving under the influence.  TMZ also reports that police have obtained a search warrant for the red Chevy that picked up Soules from the scene of the accident. Per the Associated Press, a judge sealed the warrants that let police obtain the blood samples and to enter Soules’ home.  The reality star has been holed up in his home in the aftermath of the incident. “Chris has a location-monitoring device on his leg and had to surrender his passport,” a source told Us earlier this week. The ankle monitor was a precaution because Soules previously “had plans to leave the country” before his arrest.  Soules has retained Des Moines attorneys Alfredo Parrish, Brandon Brown and Gina Messamer. In a statement to Us Weekly, the legal team says, “Soules’ 911 call, released yesterday, proved that the initial knee-jerk coverage of this accident was incorrect. While initial reports suggested Soules fled the scene, the 911 call confirms that Soules in fact was the one who contacted law enforcement immediately. During the call, he clearly identified himself and explained his role in the terrible accident. Soules attempted to resuscitate Mr. Mosher and remained on the scene with him until emergency medical personnel arrived.”  The statement continued: “His attorneys are confident that once all the evidence is made public, it will show Soules acted reasonably and did everything in his power to provide aid to Mr. Mosher. Due to the nature of the pending charges, neither Soules nor his counsel will be making any statements at this time. Soules and his family request that their privacy and the privacy of Mr. Mosher’s family is respected.”	1

"Fictional character in Star Wars  Rey is a fictional character and the main protagonist of the sequel film trilogy of the Star Wars franchise created by George Lucas. Portrayed by Daisy Ridley, Rey first appeared in The Force Awakens (2015)[1][7][8][9] and returned in The Last Jedi (2017). Ridley is slated to reprise her role in the upcoming film, The Rise of Skywalker (2019).  Rey is a scavenger who was left behind on the planet Jakku when she was a child, and later becomes involved with the Resistance's conflict with the First Order when her solitary life is interrupted by BB-8, the droid of ace Resistance pilot Poe Dameron, and a runaway stormtrooper named Finn.  Development [ edit ]  Creation and casting [ edit ]  Episode VII Rey's costume from  Screenwriter Michael Arndt said that he found Lucasfilm President Kathleen Kennedy's offer to write Episode VII daunting in mid-2012, but he became interested when it was explained to him that the tale was about the origin story of a female Jedi and he met with George Lucas.[10] The character was known as Kira in the early stages of production, and Arndt described her as a ""loner, hothead, gear-head, badass"". Arndt said that he struggled with introducing the young woman as the main character in his story while keeping her from being overshadowed after her early meeting with Luke Skywalker, whose role in the film was eventually minimized.[10] Ridley recalled that director and writer J. J. Abrams originally intended to name the character ""Keera"" [sic], but during filming in Abu Dhabi, Abrams revealed to Ridley that he was thinking of going with ""Rey"".[12]  On creating a female lead for the new trilogy, Abrams stated that from his initial discussions with writer Lawrence Kasdan, he was excited at the concept of having a woman at the center of the story. He said that ""We always wanted to write Rey as the central character"" and that other female representation in the story was also important.[1] Kennedy stated that, ""Rey is the new generation's Luke Skywalker.""[13] Rey's background as a scavenger was part of the developers attempting to portray her as ""the ultimate outsider and the ultimate disenfranchised person"", due to their belief that a person of that nature would likely experience a prolonged journey compared to other types of people.[14]  Daisy Ridley was largely unknown before being cast for the role of Rey. Ridley said that she auditioned many times for the role over the course of seven months and had to keep her casting a secret for three months.[15] She was announced as part of the cast at the end of April 2014. She only had experience with small parts in TV shows. Her inexperience and lack of exposure were a crucial part of what convinced Abrams to give Ridley the role, as the previous installments had featured relatively unknown talent that would not experience heightened degrees of scrutiny.[16] Abrams stated that Ridley ""was so funny and had a great spark"", as well as having her act out an emotional scene, proclaiming that ""she nailed it on the first take."" Abrams would go on to praise Ridley, stating ""She was born with this gift to be in a moment and make it her own. She simultaneously works from the inside out and the outside in.""[17] Kennedy proclaimed ""Daisy had a physicality and a self-confidence that was so important to the character we were looking for. She epitomizes that optimism where anything is possible.""[17] Director Dusan Lazarevic, who was present at the casting of Ridley for a role in British drama series Silent Witness, in addition to praising her acting range, stated ""She showed a combination of vulnerability and strength which gave her a complexity, and there was an intelligence in her eyes that was an indicator she could play quite a complicated part.""[16] Cailey Fleming was additionally cast to portray a young Rey.[2]  Although Ridley expressed that she was ""riddled with doubts and insecurities"", she stated that Rey's hopefulness is what she related t"	1

Rumors have been swirling about the reasons behind the breakup of Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez. And it has finally been revealed that the actual cause behind their recent split was that Selena decided to choose ‘happiness’ over Justin!  J-Beebs and Selena’s romance has been the most tumultuous one in the celebrity world. They broke up and got back together so many times that even the Jelena shippers have lost count.  Over the series of their breakups, both the stars handled their split very differently. And it’s a known fact that no matter who decides to break up, both the partners involved in a relationship feel terrible when things end between them. Having said that, one of the two always seems to be doing a little better than the other. And this time around, it seems as if Selena is trying to focus on the good instead of the bad.  A source close to the 25-year-old singer, Gomez, revealed to Us Weekly that she is ‘thrilled about her decision making process’.  REAL LIFE. REAL NEWS. REAL VOICES Help us tell more of the stories that matter from voices that too often remain unheard. Support Journal Post  While further elaborating, the source said, “Selena started seeing the bigger picture when it came to their relationship, like what was more important: her general happiness and her family and friends’ approval, or her being together with Justin, where no one really supported their relationship.”  The source continued, “She obviously chose happiness and her friends and family, and is so thrill about her decision-making process. She feels more empowered than ever and is looking forward to this next chapter.”  While talking about the Bad Liar singer’s sentiments on the same issue, the source said that Sel feels like she ‘got it out of her system’. And instead of ruminating over the breakup and holding on to the negative feelings, she has more ‘exciting’ things to look forward to – like her recent single, ‘Back 2 You’.  It has also been revealed by a source close to the family that the rift in the couple has majorly been caused due to Selena’s mother.  The source said, “Selena and Justin decided to take a break mainly because of Selena’s mom and her disapproval of Justin.”  “Justin’s family loves Selena, but Selena’s family has put her in a very conflicting spot because they still don’t trust Justin. Selena has tried to convince her family that Justin has changed… but her family isn’t budging right now,” the insider concluded.  Justin and Selena’s breakup has started to look more like a permanent one, and reality has finally started to sink in with the Jelena fans!	0
It's no secret that the past few Keeping Up With The Kardashains episode has seen tensions rise between sisters Kourtney, Kim and Khloe.  And the family feud continued on Sunday night's episode when the Kardashian-Jenner brood all got together to decide who would and wouldn't make the invite list for their annual Christmas Eve party.  Sitting around the kitchen table together, momager Kris, Kim and Khloe all ganged up on Kourtney when they slammed her for not wanting to invite her ex-boyfriend Scott, and then Kendall when they refused to invite her dad Caitlyn Jenner.  Bad blood? Kendall Jenner was left livid on Sunday night's episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians when her mom Kris refused to invite her dad Caitlyn to the annual Christmas Eve party  The hostilities began when Kourtney told her family she didn't want to invite Scott as her then boyfriend Younes Bendjima, 25, would be there - to which Kris insisted her baby daddy had to come as he was still part of the family.  'What about my dad?' butted in Kendall - pointing out Kris' ex-husband also still had connections to the family.  'Scott has never done anything mean or said anything negative, so that's different,' shouted Kim across the table.  Drama: The hostilities began when Kourtney told her family she didn't want to invite Scott as her then boyfriend Younes Bendjima, 25, would be there - to which Kris insisted her baby daddy had to come as he was still part of the family  Not hearing her: The family refused to listen to Kourtney's wishes of not inviting her ex-boyfriend Scott Disick to the family party  If Scott's invited, why not Caitlyn? Not having a bar of it, a livid and insulted Kendall replied: 'Is that actually a joke? They have both done f**ked up things in different ways'  Not having a bar of it, a livid and insulted Kendall replied: 'Is that actually a joke? They have both done f**ked up things in different ways'.  And although Kendall continued to defend Cait and fight for her right to make the invite list, the Kardashian matriarch wasn't convinced.  'No-one would know how to respond to her because of all the things,' she began to explain.  Kris' reasoning: 'No-one would know how to respond to her because of all the things,' she began to explain  She got the last word: As Kris, Kim and Khloe continued to explain how the situations were different and at the end of the day it was the momager's choice, Kourtney was the only one with the Vogue model's back  And the drama didn't end there with Kendall continuing to convince the family that no matter what had happened it was still the nice thing to do and the situation was no different to that of Scott's.  'So the f**k what? Why are we so worried about anyone else, even if she doesn't come it is the nice thing to do,' she said angrily.  Kris replied sassily: 'Oh, she would come.'

"Dustin Hoffman (born 1937) began acting at the Pasadena Playhouse, where he met fellow actor Gene Hackman. After a string of bit parts in television shows and films, he got his break with 1967's The Graduate. After ten more films and three nominations, Contents Synopsis  Early Life  Acting Career  Personal Life Quotes ""I lived below the official American poverty line until I was 31."" – Dustin Hoffman ""About the time I realized we were Jews, maybe when I was about 10, I went to the delicatessen and ordered bagels and draped them around the tree."" – Dustin Hoffman ""One thing about being successful is that I stopped being afraid of dying. Once you're a star you're dead already. You're embalmed."" – Dustin Hoffman About co-star Meryl Streep: ""She's an ox when it comes to acting. She eats words for breakfast. Working with her is like playing tennis with Chris Evert—she keeps trying to hit the perfect ball."" – Dustin Hoffman Hoffman won the Oscar for Kramer vs. Kramer (1979). Other notable movies include Tootsie (1982), Rain Man (1988), and Meet the Fockers (2004).  Dustin Lee Hoffman was born in Los Angeles, California, on August 8, 1937, to Lillian and Harry Hoffman. Though the family is Jewish, Hoffman and his brother were not raised in a religiously observant family. When asked about the family's observance of the holidays, Hoffman once said, ""About the time I realized we were Jews, maybe when I was about 10, I went to the delicatessen and ordered bagels and draped them around the tree.""    Hoffman's acting career began when at age 19 he dropped out of college to pursue the stage at the Pasadena Playhouse. There, Hoffman befriended another young actor, Gene Hackman. Eventually, the two would move to New York City together, looking for work in television and in off-Broadway plays. An unconventional-looking actor for the time period, Hoffman had difficulty getting roles in an industry primarily looking for pretty faces. To make ends meet, he took got odd jobs and the occasional bit role to pay the bills. He later recounted, ""I lived below the official American poverty line until I was 31.""    Slowly but surely, Hoffman began building a critical reputation through smaller roles. Soon word of mouth reached Hollywood and in 1966 Mike Nichols invited the young actor to do a screen test for his upcoming movie The Graduate. Beating out Hollywood heavyweights like Robert Redford and Charles Grodin, Hoffman was stunned when he received news that he had gotten the lead role in the film. The enormously popular movie changed the landscape of American cinema in the 1960s and would in turn make Hoffman an unlikely star.    Before returning to the big screen, the newly minted Academy Award nominee acted in a few Broadway productions, one of which garnered him a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Performance. In 1969, Hoffman struck gold again with the gritty Midnight Cowboy, in which he played the part of Ratso Rizzo, a homeless man in New York City. This performance won him a second Oscar nomination.    On a roll in the 1970s, Hoffman acted in more than 10 movies and, after three nominations, finally won an Oscar for his performance in Kramer vs. Kramer (1979). The movie, which costarred Meryl Streep, went on to win numerous Academy Awards. When asked about working with the talented actress, Hoffman said, ""She's an ox when it comes to acting. She eats words for breakfast. Working with her is like playing tennis with Chris Evert—she keeps trying to hit the perfect ball.""    In 1982, playing yet another antihero, Hoffman starred in Tootsie as Michael Dorsey, a down and out actor who must dress up as a woman to get a part on a daytime soap opera. This performance would earn him his fifth Oscar nomination.    After a brief but successful return to the stage in Death of a Salesman and The Merchant of Venice, Hoffman starred in his huge Hollywood smash, Rain Man, in 1988 alongside Tom Cruise.

Charles frequently described his relationship to drag as “the Superman to my Clark Kent.” The first time he stepped into his drag persona, Charles felt fully alive, electric with a power to command attention and desire. One day his therapist told him he could be Superman regardless of his attire. “She said, ‘The power you feel in drag is available to you 24/7,’ ” he told me. That realization, he said, is what he is trying to relay in each season of the show, to both the queens and the viewers. Charles is rarely in drag these days — only for special occasions, and during the judging and elimination rounds on the show — a shift that he made about a decade ago. For Charles, the confidence and fun of drag is a state of mind, not an outfit change. But he is always keenly aware of the power dynamics (the ones Halberstam noted) that favor men, even when they are taking on female personas. “We never forget the fact that we are men in a male-dominated culture where masculinity is a currency that is valued more than gold. For men to do anything with femininity, to use femininity as a palette, it’s basically an act of treason in our culture.”  During a break in taping while I was on set, Charles rounded up people for a game of dirty charades, which he loves so much that he keeps a list of clever ideas on his iPhone that is several swipes long. Empty director’s chairs were dragged into an approximation of an audience around the giant stage where the show’s contestants usually walk the runway. About half a dozen crew members arranged themselves accordingly. Charles, impeccable in his petal-pink three-piece suit, leapt onto the stage, lit by fuchsia lights, and signaled the start of the game. He used his hands to simulate the whirring of an analog film camera, and then held up three fingers, indicating a three-word movie title. He pinched his forefinger and thumb to indicate that the first word was short. He curled his hands into soft fists and raised them to his mouth. He mimed licking himself, and then spun around and squatted, reaching his hands around and motioning as if he were pulling something from his ass. The group, including me, burst into laughter. Someone yelled, “That Darn Scat!” and Charles slapped his thighs and released a peal of laughter so distinct and delightful — like a throaty giggle — that as a child his older sisters regularly tickled it out of him.  No one wanted to try and top that performance, so Charles cycled through several more R-rated versions of movies and songs like “It’s the Hard-Knock Life,” “A Clockwork Orange” and “The Blue Lagoon.” After each round, there was wild applause. I had the discomfiting sensation of catching a glimpse of something deeply private, like walking in on someone in a state of undress or using the bathroom. I had seen more than 100 episodes of “Drag Race.” I had watched Charles play the matriarch and patriarch, dispensing wisdom, jokes, admonishments and pep talks. Here, he looked carefree as he moved seamlessly between impersonations of a tough biker, a coquettish flirt, a naughty schoolgirl. Onscreen, he was always slightly removed, distant, ruling the show with a steely reserve that bordered on conservatism. The contrast between that Ru and the Ru pantomiming masturbation onstage was so disorienting it made my head spin. Watching him shape-shift onstage, I finally understood what he was trying to get at, how he refuses the outward ways in which people try to characterize him — and really, all people.  Charles has been with his husband, Georges LeBar, since 1994, when they met on the dance floor at Limelight. On their second date, they flew from London to Düsseldorf on Elton John’s private jet. They married in early 2017, 23 years after they met. The couple split their time between Los Angeles and Wyoming, where LeBar, a ruggedly handsome man somehow taller than Charles, has a 60,000-acre ranch. When they can, they take quick trips to San Francisco, New York or Maui. One time they 	1
"Story highlights Caitlyn Jenner said she ""would look for a senatorial run""  Other celebrities have recently floated political runs  Washington (CNN) Caitlyn Jenner is the latest celebrity to float a run for political office in the age of President Donald Trump.  The Olympic gold medalist who has been an outspoken activist for transgender rights, told radio host John Catsimatidis that she is interested in the ""the political side of activism"" and ""would look for a senatorial run.""  ""Can I do a better job from the outside?"" said Jenner, a lifelong Republican. ""Kind of working the perimeter of the political scene, being open to talking to anybody? Or are you better from the inside, and we are in the process of determining that. Yeah, but I would look for a senatorial run.""  When asked whether Jenner is seriously considering a run and if she would run as a Republican or an independent, her publicist, Alan Nierob, told CNN Monday that there are ""no further details to report at this time.""  This comes after wrestling star and actor Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson said that he would consider running for president in 2020, musician Kid Rock insisting last week that his tweet about running for the Senate is no joke and, in perhaps the most viral moment of celebrities exploring a run for office, Kanye West declaring a 2020 presidential bid during his speech at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards.

This year's event raised $1.2 million for the charity.  ""So honored my dear friend Ashley Olsen came to support my SclerodermaResearch.org Foundation @SRFcure Event as she has all these years,"" the actor-comedian wrote in an Instagram caption alongside of photo of him, Olsen and John Oliver from the big night.  While neither Olsen nor her sister decided to take part in the Netflix series ""Fuller House"" with Saget and the rest of the gang, she's been a faithful supporter of this event and of the cause that's so close to her friend's heart.  Saget sits on the board of the Scleroderma Research Foundation, and his involvement with fundraising for the organization started before he had a direct connection to the autoimmune disease.  ""Just three years after I found out what ‘scleroderma’ was, my sister was sitting in the audience at the benefit, now actually diagnosed with this orphan disease,"" he explained in an essay he penned for TODAY. ""One year later, Gay lost her life to it. She was only 47.""  Since then he's helped raise millions for the foundation.  ""Thanks to the amazing research we fund at John’s Hopkins, Stanford and UCSF, new drugs and new therapies have been developed, helping thousands of those struggling with this sometimes fatal disease,"" he explained.

Mary J. Blige is celebrating the gift of My Life. The Queen of Hip-Hop soul marked the 25th anniversary of her sophomore album with a candid Instagram post on Friday (Nov. 29).  “I didn’t know what it would do, or how successful it would be. I was in so much pain and was ready to check out and I know I needed to say these things, to get them off my chest,” Blige captioned a video touting the album’s achievements.  My Life opened “doors” to people who were experiencing similar emotional pain, Blige added. “It touched so many people lives in the world. It gave me confirmation that I wasn’t alone and we had to fight for our lives. The fight wasn’t pretty and is still hard at times, but we keep fighting. And now we are here as an example that if we outlast our opposition, keep fighting and don’t give up, life will continue to get better.”  Blige wrapped up the post with a thank you to fans for staying “on the journey” with her for more than two decades. “You have no idea how much this means to me. I look at my albums as if they are my children and today I celebrate my 2nd child, who is my most dysfunctional one.. lol.. who I love so much!”  Released on Nov. 29, 1994, My Life, became the year’s best selling R&B album.

CLICK HERE if you are having trouble viewing the photos or video on a mobile device  With Angelina Jolie finally moving on from her nasty, splashy split from Brad Pitt, you would expect her to shy away from dating someone else super-famous.  But you would think her next romantic interest would still be someone whose profession matched her preferences for prestige artistry or international do-gooding: a documentary filmmaker, a human rights crusader, an Ebola doctor.  But no, Jolie’s choice reportedly is far more home-grown and, well, mundane in a L.A. way.  Jolie, the Oscar winning actress, UNHCR special envoy and occasional New York Times op-ed columnist, is dating a real estate agent. That’s according to a new report in “Entertainment Tonight.”  Of course, at this stage, things are still pretty new, which means “it’s not serious,” a source told ET.  But the so-called real estate agent, who has not been identified, reportedly has a few things going for him that would make him appealing to the glamorous 42-year-old actress and mother of six, ET said.  He’s handsome, a source close to the actress told ET. He’s also “older-looking” and isn’t “a celebrity or high-profile” in any way, the source added. These are qualities that would probably make him relatively down-to-earth — by Jolie standards — and confer on him a maturity and stability that could be comforting to her.  After all, she was “in a very bad place” after her acrimonious split from Pitt in September 2016, “ET” reported. Their breakup included allegations of drinking and anger management problems — on his part — and led to investigations by child welfare authorities until the couple quietly worked out visitation and other issues. The estranged couple share children Maddox, 16, Zahara, 13, Pax, 14, Shiloh, 11, and nine-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne.  “Just having another adult to spend time with has been helpful,” the source added to ET.  But not so fast, sources have told both Us Weekly and People. Both outlets reported Tuesday, citing their own Jolie sources, that Jolie isn’t dating a real estate agent — or anyone for that matter at the moment.  “Yes, she has hung out with a couple of guys over the last year, but it’s extremely low-key,” a source told Us.  Unfortunately, things are still difficult between her and Pitt, added The Daily Mail. “Things between Brad and Angie really ended poorly, and while they’ve attempted therapy with the children, they can barely be in the same room together,” a source said.

Because the breakup has forced Jolie to curtail her globe-trotting ways and base herself in Los Angeles — close to Pitt for the sake of the children — there is speculation that if Jolie were seeing a real estate agent — or anyone else — the man would be based in Los Angeles, the Daily Mail said.  And if there is a real estate agent with whom she has become friendly, he could be someone with celebrity clientele.  Perhaps he could have been someone involved in settling Jolie into her new house — the $25 million estate in Los Feliz she bought last year, which once belonged to legendary director Cecil B. DeMille. Incidentally, Jolie’s mansion is “just down the street” from Pitt’s estate in Los Feliz — for the sake of the kids, of course.  Whether or not there is a real estate agent boyfriend in Jolie’s life, or she’s just single and focusing on her kids, her friends are relieved to see her happy for a change, ET reported.  She also seems to have settled into enjoying her day-to-day life. She is often spotted out and about in Los Angeles, usually with one of her six kids in tow, doing ordinary-people things like shopping at a neighborhood Whole Foods or going to the movies — including, reportedly, the new	0

Season 2 is expected to continue following Cavallari’s life in Nashville and will feature 10 one-hour episodes.

The first-season finale is set for Sunday, Aug. 26, and will chronicle the Uncommon James store opening and launch party. But several huge mistakes by Kristin’s staff on opening day push the star to her breaking point, while Brittainy worries about her position in the company and Shannon helps Mike pop the question to Taylor.

Very Cavallari is produced by T Group Productions with Jenny Daly, Rob Lobl, and Kristin Cavallari serving as Executive Producers.  “I couldn’t be happier that Very Cavallari will be returning for season two,” said Cavallari. “I had the best time filming our first season and feel like we are just getting started…”	1
"Nicole Kidman reveals creepy secret: 'I eat bugs'          Nicole Kidman. Picture: Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP Nicole Kidman's ""hidden talent"" is eating bugs. The 'Killing of a Sacred Deer' star has devoured a number of critters including ""extraordinary"" hornworms, ""fruity"" mealworms, ""exquisite"" grasshoppers and crickets, which she likens to a ""hairy nut"". Speaking about her talent in a video for Vanity Fair magazine, she said: ""Two billion people in the world eat bugs and I'm one of them. I'm telling you, I'd win Survivor."" Meanwhile, Nicole's husband Keith Urban previously said he doesn't want his wife to be ""tough"". Nicole shared: ""Well, Keith always says to me, 'You stay raw and sensitive, and I'll buffer things for you', which is a beautiful offering. He is always told, 'You're so tough.' And he says, 'That's not what I want for you, Nicole. You don't need to get a thick skin.'  ""I think, for me, it's about having a place that's safe to nurture you, where the tears can be shed. That way I can actually go back open and curious and willing. And at times scarred and a little damaged, but not with a sword like, 'I'm seeking revenge.' Because that just doesn't interest me. I actually never choose films that are about revenge. I choose films, I've realised, about women who somehow find their way through.""  Nicole has always been a ""sensitive"" person and has always spent a lot of time dwelling on her feelings.  She added: ""My mother said I was always an intense child, a very sensitive child. So that probably helped the emotions to be very present. I was just a big thinker. I would evaluate and analyse and feel and cry and discuss and be angry. All of those emotions were very surface for me.""  Bang Showbiz"	1
"When I arrive to meet Skeet Ulrich at his home in Studio City, Los Angeles, I’m greeted by his well-mannered 16-year-old son, Jakob, who escorts me into the house through the garage. “I built this,” he says, pointing to a motorcycle. I’m impressed, and had I not just walked 850 feet uphill in a sweatshirt, I might have managed more than a “wow, that’s awesome!” But I’m winded and red-faced, and can’t believe I have to meet his dad, a god of the late nineties, looking like a tomato.  These days, Ulrich, 47, is known as Jughead’s jailbird father, FP Jones, on The CW murder-mystery Riverdale, but his career has spanned more than two decades, popping off in 1996 with roles in The Craft, in which he played a high-school creep put under a love spell, and Scream, in which he played a serial killer who somehow made fake blood look finger-licking good. (“Corn syrup,” the line goes. “Same stuff they used for pig’s blood in Carrie.”) Leave it to a shrink to unpack the how and why of Billy Loomis’s sex appeal (I’d say it’s the greasy hair) — Ulrich was just trying to act.  Scream. Miramax  “This was when you received hard fan mail, and there would be trash bags full of letters, so I was aware that I had a popularity,” he tells me from his couch, where his dog Lua, who is smaller than my forearm, flops around like a Beanie Baby come to life. “As to where I sat on the heartthrob scale, I had no [idea]. There was no real barometer. You go on Instagram now and, yeah, we all know Cole [Sprouse, who plays Jughead] is a heartthrob. It’s very obvious.” If only Skeet Ulrich saw the inside of my middle-school notebooks.  Ulrich was married to actress Georgina Cates by the age of 27 and moved to a farm in Virginia not long after. (He and Cates have twins, Jakob and Naiia, born in 2001; the couple divorced in 2005.) He rarely walked red carpets because he hates getting his picture taken. “I never look how I thought I’d look,” he says. “I’m like, I think I look pretty good tonight. And then I see the picture and I’m like, Oh, I was very wrong.” He was the only star of Scream absent from the stage at the MTV Movie Awards when the Wes Craven horror film took home Best Movie (it was up against Romeo + Juliet). The fame was “not something I was interested in,” he says. “I was really interested in doing things that challenged me.”  The Newton Boys. 20th Century Fox via Getty Images  He took roles in James L. Brooks’s As Good as It Gets (1997), Richard Linklater’s The Newton Boys (1998), and Ang Lee’s Ride With the Devil (1999), and says he passed on movies like Armageddon (the role went to Ben Affleck) and Face/Off (the role went to Alessandro Nivola). It's as if he was borrowing from Leonardo DiCaprio’s Guide to Rejecting Leomania: no matter how hot teens think you are, do not make movies they'll care about.  “I see Leo around quite a bit,” Ulrich says. “He’s always very nice. He’ll stop conversations he’s having to come say hi to me, so whatever bond we formed 20 years ago, it still has relevance to both of us.” The guys hung out back in the day, after DiCaprio’s friend, magician David Blaine, came to live with Ulrich for about six months. But when I inquire about the infamous Pussy Posse, DiCaprio’s clique of womanizing party boys whose members included Lukas Haas, Tobey Maguire (with whom Urlich starred in Ride With the Devil), and Blaine, Ulrich looks puzzled. “I don’t even know what that is.”  As thrilling as it is to recount the glory days of the nineties, at least for me (Ulrich seems more animated when talking about how much he hates Trump — ""he's got to be impeached before he destroys the world"" — or how much he loves Darren Aronofsky’s Mother! than he does his past), there’s a more serious matter to discuss. Nine days prior to our meeting, the New York Times published an article alleging that producer Harvey Weinstein, whose long list of movies includes Scream, had been sexually harassing women for decades, reportedly trying to coerce actresses "	1

"Karlie Kloss has seen the headlines that her friendship with Taylor Swift is apparently over because she had sushi one night with a group of friends that included Swift's frenemy Katy Perry. But, sleep easy, Jennifer Lawrence and all other concerned Kaylor fans: EVERYTHING IS OKAY. Really! Kloss just assured the New York Times!  When the outlet asked her about the status of her and Swift's friendship in a new interview, Kloss replied, “Don’t believe everything you read."" So, Kloss' ""Swish Swish"" caption and Perry hangout truly do mean nothing?  The NYT noted that Kloss and Swift ""continue to be good friends, and they talk frequently."" Imagine all the laughing-cat emojis they texted when that first Kaylor is dead story went around. (Kloss may have just sent a standard laughing face since she's a dog person.) Maybe Swift really is just keeping her relationships private.  Kloss also talked about her friendship with Serena Williams in much more expressive terms. ""Serena is one of the most extraordinary women on the planet,” Kloss said. “She challenges the status quo in so many ways, and I learn from her constantly.”  However, Kloss would not talk about her other heavily-scrutinized relationship with boyfriend Joshua Kushner, the quiet March for Our Lives-donating, liberal brother of Trump senior advisor/son-in-law Jared Kushner. “My relationship has nothing to do with this interview,” she said. Okay then."	1

Hold scrolling for 2017 Emmys’ largest style danger-takers, from Reese Witherspoon to Leslie Jones.  Richard Shotwell/Invision/AP Reese Witherspoon  The Massive Little Lies star was an enormous winner of the night time, for her position within the present and as an government producer. Whereas Reese’s Stella McCartney tuxedo gown and matching Christian Louboutin pumps appeared like protected decisions, the ensemble was an enormous departure from her extremely-female, physique-hugging robes of Emmys’ previous. She confirmed as much as the purple carpet making a method assertion: “I am not just a few fairly Hollywood actress; I am a boss.” Her males’s-impressed piece stated all of it, and we listened.  Frazer Harrison/Getty Pictures Titus Burgess  Mellow, this isn’t. The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt star turned heads in a mustard-yellow jacket that checked out each occasions luxe and enjoyable. Cheers to extra males taking a trend danger on the purple carpet!  John Shearer/WireImage Evan Rachel Wooden  There isn’t any greater trend danger-taker in Hollywood than the Westworld actress. You’ll by no means discover her in only a fairly, match-and-flare gown, so when Evan confirmed as much as the Emmys in an all-white, three-piece Moschino go well with, we have been completely enthralled. Not solely did she channel main circus ringmaster vibes with stylish execution, however, truthfully, have you learnt how onerous it’s to tug off all white? Brava!  Frazer Harrison/Getty Photographs Lena Waithe  The Emmy winner appeared like a golden statue in a brocade tuxedo jacket, proving you do not have to put on a metallic gown to get consideration.  J.

It is 2017—however for some purpose, glamorous robes and fairly clothes are nonetheless main indicators of femininity. Properly, not for The Crown actress, who confirmed everybody how regal you possibly can look in a jewel-encrusted Oscar de la Renta jumpsuit and Harry Winston jewels. We gotta say: The over-the-shoulder practice was fairly majestic.  Frazer Harrison/Getty Pictures Leslie Jones  Slay, woman, slay! A horny, see-via, black gown on a pink carpet? Been there, completed that…besides on the comic, which makes her look within the Christian Siriano robe so refreshing. Leslie, who’s extra recognized for comedic timing than as a style plate, proved you might be humorous and ooze intercourse attraction. It is all about confidence.  John Shearer/WireImage Viola Davis  Orange you so pleased Viola wore such a cheerful colour on the pink carpet. OK, perhaps not so humorous joke, however the Easy methods to Get Away With Homicide star stood aside from the black and sequins pack in her Zac Posen frock.

"Late spring is here which means one thing: it is the thick of prom season. Before the big day comes promposals, which can be intimidating — especially when you don't know which way it's going to go. Fear, however, did not stop a Burger King in Lynn, Massachusetts from asking the Wendy's next door (very publicly) to prom via a storefront sign.  “@WENDYS PROM?” Burger King's marquee read.  Frankly, we'd be a little scared if we were Burger King waiting for a reply back from Wendy's, who's delivered some pretty savage burns this year to their competitors on Twitter. This time though, the red head spared BK and agreed to go — under a few conditions.  “OK, but don’t get handsy and we have to be home by 10,” Wendy’s tweeted.  Ok, but don’t get handsy and we have to be home by 10. https://t.co/tQunlsqecG — Wendy's (@Wendys) May 9, 2018  Burger King then changed their sign and it's pretty adorable.  .@wendys looking forward to it. let’s aim for king and queen of prom. 🤴👸 pic.twitter.com/KMBktLPLfl — Burger King (@BurgerKing) May 9, 2018  ""@wendys looking forward to it. let’s aim for king and queen of prom,"" BK tweeted with a photo of the new sign that reads, ""SHE SAID YES! ""    Twitter users are totally loving the fast food romance, too, flooding their tweets with replies to the saga.  You'll find that perfect someone — Wendy's (@Wendys) May 9, 2018  AND THE PROM QUEEN! BOW TO YOUR QUEEN! — Wendy's (@Wendys) May 9, 2018  How dare you — Wendy's (@Wendys) May 9, 2018  Screenshot via Twitter  Moon Pie, the snack company behind those marshmallow-filled, chocolate-covered pies made with graham crackers, is another brand who's social media game has been crazy strong as of lately. Seizing the opportunity to get in on the viral moment, they responded with a hinge of playful jealousy for not asking Wendy's first.    We’ll save you a dance or two for sure — Wendy's (@Wendys) May 9, 2018  The pig-tailed fast food chain may have let Burger King slide this time by saying yes to prom, but McDonald's did not receive the same treatment. Wendy's threw a couple quick jabs at McDonald's via Twitter.  Ouch.  hope not — Wendy's (@Wendys) May 9, 2018  Apparently Wendy's super bowl ad trolling Mickey D's wasn't enough social media savagery for one year.    Follow Delish on Instagram."	1
"American criminal, cult leader  Charles Milles Manson (né Maddox, November 12, 1934 – November 19, 2017) was an American criminal and cult leader. In mid-1967, he formed what became known as the ""Manson Family"", a quasi-commune based in California. His followers committed a series of nine murders at four locations in July and August 1969. According to the Los Angeles County district attorney, Manson plotted to start a race war, though he and others disputed this motive.[3] In 1971, he was convicted of first-degree murder and conspiracy to commit murder for the deaths of seven people. The prosecution conceded that Manson never literally ordered the murders, but they contended that his ideology constituted an overt act of conspiracy.[4] Manson was also convicted of first-degree murder for the deaths of Gary Hinman and Donald Shea.  Manson was an unemployed ex-convict who had spent more than half of his life in correctional institutions at the time when he began gathering his cult following. Before the murders, he was a singer-songwriter on the fringe of the Los Angeles music industry, chiefly through a chance association with Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys. In 1968, the Beach Boys recorded Manson's song ""Cease to Exist"", retitled ""Never Learn Not to Love"" as the B-side on one of their singles, but without a credit to Manson.  The Los Angeles district attorney said that Manson was obsessed with the Beatles, particularly their 1968 self-titled album known as the ""White Album"". He claimed to be guided by his interpretation of the Beatles' lyrics and adopted the term ""Helter Skelter"" to describe an impending apocalyptic race war. At trial, the prosecution claimed that Manson and his followers believed that the murders would help precipitate that war. Other contemporary interviews and those who testified during the penalty phase of Manson's trial insisted that the Tate–LaBianca murders were copycat crimes designed to exonerate Manson's friend Bobby Beausoleil.[5][6]  From the beginning of Manson's notoriety, a pop culture arose around him and he became an emblem of insanity, violence, and the macabre. Recordings were released commercially of songs written and performed by Manson, starting with Lie: The Love and Terror Cult (1970). Various musicians have covered some of his songs. Manson was originally sentenced to death, but his sentence was commuted to life with the possibility of parole after the California Supreme Court invalidated the state's death penalty statute in 1972. He served his life sentence at California State Prison, Corcoran and died at age 83 in late 2017.  1934–1967: Early life  Childhood  Charles Manson was born on November 12, 1934, to 16-year-old Kathleen Manson-Bower-Cavender,[7] née Maddox (1918–1973),[8] in the University of Cincinnati Academic Health Center in Cincinnati, Ohio. He was first named ""no name Maddox"".[9][10][11] Within weeks, he was called Charles Milles Maddox.[9][12]  Manson's biological father appears to have been Colonel Walker Henderson Scott Sr. (1910–1954)[13] of Catlettsburg, Kentucky, against whom Kathleen Maddox filed a paternity suit that resulted in an agreed judgment in 1937. Manson may never have known his biological father.[9][11] Scott worked intermittently in local mills, and also had a local reputation as a con artist. He allowed Maddox to believe he was an army colonel, although ""Colonel"" was merely his given name. When Maddox told Scott she was pregnant, he told her he had been called away on army business; after several months she realized he had no intention of returning.[14]  In August 1934, before Manson's birth, Maddox married William Eugene Manson (1909–1961), whose occupation was listed on Charles's birth certificate as a ""laborer"" at a dry cleaning business.[15] Maddox went on drinking sprees for days at a time with her brother Luther, leaving Charles with a variety of babysitters. They were divorced on April 30, 1937, when a court accepted Manson's charge of ""gross n"	0

"The INSIDER Summary:  It seems that Rihanna has good and bad body image days — just like most people.  In a recent interview with The Cut, she said that she dresses according to how she feels on a given day or week.  Some days she prefers body-con dresses, but other days she gravitates to oversized pieces.  In general, the singer advocates for dressing in a way that makes you feel good.  No matter what she's wearing or how she's feeling, Rihanna has an amazing sense of style.    Most people struggle with their body image at some point or another — even Rihanna. The singer recently told The Cut that her body image influences the way she dresses, which we first read about on StyleCaster.  ""I actually have had the pleasure of a fluctuating body type, where one day I can literally fit into something that is body-con, and then the next day — the next week — I need something oversized,"" she told The Cut. ""I need a little crop here and a high-waist there to hide that part, you know?""  A post shared by badgalriri (@badgalriri) Oct 11, 2017 at 5:37pm PDT  ""I really pay attention every day when I go into the closet about what's working for my body that morning. I feel like that's how everyone should go after fashion, because it's an individual thing,"" she continued.  A post shared by badgalriri (@badgalriri) Oct 11, 2017 at 5:11am PDT  The singer explained that she takes certain factors into account while planning an outfit.  ""If you take it further, it’s like: What week are you having? You having a skinny week? You having a fat week? Are we doing arms this week? We doing legs this week? We doing oversized?"" she said.  A post shared by badgalriri (@badgalriri) Oct 13, 2017 at 1:59pm PDT  Regardless of how she feels, Rihanna said that she sees fashion as something fun.  ""I love to play with silhouettes as well, but I think it's important to make sure that you wear the thing that works for your body the best, and that's flattering,"" Rihanna explained.  A post shared by badgalriri (@badgalriri) Oct 8, 2017 at 8:05pm PDT  No matter what she's wearing or how she's feeling, we're obsessed with Rihanna's trendsetting, runway-inspired sense of style."	1

"This article is about the attorney. For his son, the television personality, see Rob Kardashian  Robert George Kardashian (February 22, 1944 – September 30, 2003) was an American attorney and businessman. He gained national recognition as O. J. Simpson's friend and defense attorney during Simpson's 1995 murder trial. He had four children with his first wife, Kris Kardashian (née Houghton, later Jenner): Kourtney, Kim, Khloé, and Rob, who appear on their family reality television series, Keeping Up with the Kardashians, and its spinoffs.  Early life  Kardashian was born in Los Angeles, California. He has a sister and brother, Barbara and Tom Kardashian.[2][3] His great-grandparents, Saghatel (""Sam"") and Harom Kardaschoff, were ethnic Armenian Spiritual Christian Prygun[4] immigrants from Karakale (now: Merkezkarakale), Kars Oblast of the Russian Empire (now Kars Province in Turkey). The family, known at the time by the surname Kardaschoff, in Russian style, made their way from their home village of Karakale probably to Bremerhaven, Germany, a popular emigration port. From there, they travelled to a new life in America. Their son Tatos anglicized his name to Tom, started a business in garbage collection in Los Angeles, and married another Kars-Karakale immigrant, Hamas Shakarian.[5]  Growing up in the Baldwin Hills area of Los Angeles, Kardashian attended Susan Miller Dorsey High School and the University of Southern California, from which he graduated in 1966 with a B.S. degree in business administration.[6] He earned a J.D. degree from the University of San Diego School of Law and practiced for about a decade; after that, he went into business. In 1973, Kardashian was one of the co-founders of the trade publication Radio & Records, which he and his partners sold for a large profit in 1979.[6] Kardashian also pioneered the idea of playing music between movies in theaters. He subsequently parlayed the concept into a business, starting a company called Movie Tunes.[7][8][9][10] He served as President and CEO of the firm and later invested in Juice Inc., a frozen yogurt company, and in a music video business called Concert Cinema.[11][12]  O. J. Simpson case  Kardashian and Simpson first met around 1967 while both of them were at USC and became close friends.[13] Robert was the water boy for the USC Trojans football team which would be ranked #1 in the nation in the AP Poll.  Following the June 12, 1994, murder of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman, Simpson stayed in Kardashian's house to avoid the media. Kardashian was the man seen carrying Simpson's garment bag the day that Simpson flew back from Chicago. Prosecutors speculated that the bag may have contained Simpson's bloody clothes or the murder weapon.[14] When Simpson failed to turn himself in at 11 a.m. on June 17, 1994, Kardashian read a letter by Simpson to the assembled media. This letter was interpreted by many as a suicide note.[15]  Simpson was charged with the murders and subsequently acquitted of all criminal charges in a controversial criminal trial. Kardashian had let his license to practice law become inactive before the Simpson case but reactivated it to aid in Simpson's defense as a volunteer assistant on his legal team, alongside Simpson's main defense attorneys, Robert Shapiro and Johnnie Cochran. As one of Simpson's lawyers and a member of the defense ""Dream Team"", Kardashian could not be compelled or subpoenaed to testify against Simpson in the case, which included Simpson's past history and behavior with his ex-wife Nicole, and as to the contents of Simpson's garment bag.[16] He sat by Simpson throughout the trial.[17]  The New York Times reported that Kardashian said in a 1996 ABC interview that he had questioned Simpson's innocence: ""I have doubts. The blood evidence is the biggest thorn in my side; that causes me the greatest problems. So I struggle with the blood evidence.""[16] Not long after the trial, Kardashian ultimately severed his ties with "	1
"Shawn Mendes seems to be good at everything, from dropping a no. 1 album to rocking Frances McDormand's leafy headdress at the Met Gala. So it's no surprise that he's also good at hosting late night television and slaying James Corden in a cover battle contest.  Shawn has been hanging out with James on The Late Late Show this past week; call it a takeover, call it guest-hosting, call it whatever you want — but we’re calling it our new favorite TV show. The latest shenanigans Shawn and James got into was a cover battle, where they competed in a subway station (AKA a set dressed up to look like they were singing in the subway) to see who could do the most epic cover. Shawn took on Oasis’s “Wonderwall,” while James whipped out a literal piano and sparkly jacket to do “Great Balls of Fire,” which definitely raised the stakes for Shawn.  Not to be outdone, Shawn transformed himself into “DJ Stitches,” a nod to his first big hit, and blasted “We Found Love” by Rihanna, complete with a light machine and sunglasses. James then masqueraded as all five Backstreet Boys by wearing puppets in white suits to perform “Everybody.” Their turf war finally ended when Shawn came down from the ceiling in a literal angel outfit to sing his own song, “There's Nothing Holdin' Me Back,” alongside a gospel choir. You don’t see that in a subway station every day, do you? In our opinion, DJ Stitches definitely won the cover battle.  Shawn and James shared more of their favorite music in an episode of Carpool Karaoke recently too. They sang some of Shawn’s biggest hits, like “Treat You Better” and “Mercy,” and Shawn even dressed up like Harry Potter to discuss his super-fandom of the book series. This week-long takeover of the Late Late Show has us thinking that Shawn could definitely have a career as a talk show host.  Let us slide into your DMs. Sign up for the Teen Vogue daily email.

Showbiz 411 first reported on Saturday the power couple welcomed two children on Monday night or Tuesday morning.  A source later told People magazine: 'Bey and Jay are thrilled and have started sharing the news with their family and closest friends.'  His post: Taking to Twitter, Mathew posted a picture of a birthday note which read: 'Happy Birthday to the twins! Love, Granddad'  One of each: This rather telling balloon and floral gift was delivered to the hospital on Sunday with a card which read: 'To B and J' following speculation the couple had a boy and a girl  Another batch of balloons! Another woman was seen heading to the hospital with pink and blue balloons  The power couple - who got married in 2008 - announced they were adding to their brood in February when the Formation hitmaker posted a photograph of her burgeoning baby bump on her social networking sites.  She wrote at the time: 'We would like to share our love and happiness.  'We have been blessed two times over. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for your well wishes. - The Carters.'  Their first little one': With daughter Blue Ivy in February  The pair have remained relatively silent throughout the pregnancy but Beyonce's mother Tina Knowles hasn't been able to contain her excitement.  She said recently: 'I'm so excited. I can't wait.'  And 63-year-old Tina - who is also mother to 30-year-old singer Solange Knowles - has also praised her eldest daughter for being an 'incredible parent.'  She said: '[Beyoncé and Jay Z are] incredible parents. She's a really good mom. Really patient and kind. [My biggest lesson was] teaching them that what is on the inside counts more than what's on the outside. I see her passing it on, and it makes me really proud because that was my biggest lesson.'  Labour of love? There was fevered speculation Beyonce was at an LA hospital to give birth earlier on Tuesday  On Saturday an unidentified female was pictured delivering a balloon and floral gift on Sunday morning which appeared to give the game away.  There was a pink and blue balloon, with one reading: 'It's a boy' and the other reading: 'It's a girl.'  The accompanying envelope had: 'To B & J' on the front which appears to be confirmation but could have been sent by an over-zealous fan.  And now it has been reported that a 'minor issue' has kept their bundles of joys in hospital, according to TMZ.  Sources close to the couple told the publication: 'The twins were born Monday in a Los Angeles hospital. We're told a ""minor issue"" surfaced, and as a result ... doctors do not feel comfortable releasing them.'  Although the nature of the issue is not clear nor when they'll be released, an insider added that Beyonce remains at the hospital but 'is okay. The babies are expected to be okay as well.'  Dailymail.com has reached out to Beyonce and Jay-Z's reps for comment.  There has be"	1

"In today's critically important beauty news: RIHANNA HAS A BOB.  The Fenty Beauty mogul hopped on this summer's trend of ""short hair, don't care"" and chopped off her hair. She posted a story to Instagram fluffing a textured, angled bob, and it's good.  Instead of a blunt bob, Rihanna opted for an asymmetrical cut, which gave her more length in the back, while the front pieces hit an inch above her chin. She parted the look on the side for added volume. Leave it to Rihanna to add an entirely new twist to a style that's been flooding our feeds all summer long.  In the shot, she's also showing off one of the new looks from her Savage x Fenty line — a candy-apple-red bra. She paired it with some purple cat-eye sunglasses to complete the look, perfect for end-of-July heat.  In fairness, RiRi changes up her hair almost as frequently as she changes her heels, though for the past few months she's been wearing it long. Historically, she's experimented with almost every shade of the rainbow, including blue, blonde, and gray, and has worn long hair to her waist, as well as shaved her head. Most recently, she was spotted in a lace-front blonde wig.  This season, ""short hair"" has pretty much become synonymous with ""summer beauty."" Stars, including Jessica Chastain, Emma Roberts, and Lucy Hale, have all made the chop. Hell, even earlier this week Alicia Keys cut it all off, debuting a '90s-inspired pixie cut that rendered her almost unrecognizable.  If you're having ""Wild Thoughts"" about re-creating the look for yourself, there's an easy way to see if your hair is ready for an attempt. ""At home, you can do a test with a gentle pull of your top layer, seeing if it reaches your chin. If it doesn't, your top should grow a bit more before attempting this cut,"" says New York City-based salon owner Paul Labrecque tells Allure. ""The stylist should look at your hair and be able tell if your top layer is long enough to pull off this style, even if your hair is wavy.""

Chris Soules hasn’t been seen since his arrest after leaving the scene of a fatal crash back in April and his court appearance on April 25. The former Bachelor star has come out of his hiding place oddly enough to stop at an O’Reilly’s Auto Parts in Iowa this Wednesday.  Soules was pretty friendly with the press, and we really seemed in a good mood at the moment. He chatted with some customers and employees during his errand.  There was one very excited employee who told the 35-year-old that she always wanted to meet him and she also asked him to pose a photo which he did.  Earlier this week, he pleaded not guilty for leaving the scene of the accident in April.  The auto parts employee posted a photo on her Instagram account saying that he was her sweet customer from that day.  Despite all the nasty things that have been going on with the star, he was all smiles posing for the picture for the O’Reilley’s employee.  She received some backlash for her Instagram post and then she posted an emotional message on her Facebook account for the whole world to see as she was asking for compassion and love.  “This is a kind-hearted man. He is a farmer. I was able to let him know that I pray for him and that meant a lot to me. I just wanted to tell him that and I got the opportunity finally.”  Soules is having some serious trouble since he was involved in that particular fatal accident that killed the 66-year-old Kenneth Mosher in Buchanan County, Iowa.  After the crash, Soules was arrested at his home which is a few miles away, and he was charged because of leaving the scene of a fatal accident.  This is a Class D felony in Iowa that could lead to a five-year jail sentence.  Advertisement  His lawyers said in a statement last month that Soules was the one that contacted the police and, “during the call, he clearly identified himself and explained his role in the terrible accident. Soules attempted to resuscitate Mr. Mosher and remained on the scene with him until emergency medical personnel arrived.”	1

It’s time to bust out the yogurt guacamole and misshapen pirate donuts, because two of Netflix’s best new food-related shows — Queer Eye and Nailed It — are getting picked up for second seasons. The news comes six weeks after the premiere of the lifestyle makeover show and less than three weeks after the debut of the hilarious cooking competition. Vulture notes that Netflix wants to release new episodes of both series by the end of the year.  A reboot of a trend-setting early aughts TV show, Queer Eye introduced audiences to five new lifestyle experts — aka the Fab Five — including culinary aficionado Antoni Porowski. Shortly after the show’s debut, a handful of publications questioned whether or not Porowski, who demonstrated how to make things like grilled cheese and dressed-up hot dogs, actually knew how to cook. The resounding answer to that question is: Yes, Antoni definitely does know how to cook, but also, he shouldn’t have to do culinary backflips on Queer Eye as part of his job. The Fab Five want to instill confidence in the people they work with, and sometimes that involves showing a sad dad how easy it is to mix avocados with Greek yogurt for a light and fabulous party dip. Antoni is clearly not fazed by the haters.  Thanks for the wishes!! Plz send avo baskets, elementary how-to cookbooks and corgi puppies to my manager. Love you all ❤️❤️❤️ — Antoni Porowski (@antoni) March 14, 2018  Nailed It, meanwhile, is a game show wherein amateur bakers attempt to recreate elaborate pastry masterpieces in a limited amount of time. The key to the show’s success is largely attributed to the comedic stylings of host Nicole Byer, and her charmed chemistry with judge Jacques Torres. Nailed It celebrates pastry triumphs and colossal kitchen blunders in equal measure.  Netflix never releases ratings information, but the head of unscripted content, Bela Bajaria, points out that both shows generated great buzz on social media. “All of the cultural conversation and all the social media has increased every week,” Bajaria says, referring to Queer Eye in particular. “And that means people are feeling an emotional connection, and they want to share it. That doesn’t always happen.”  There’s still no word yet on whether or not Netflix’s other big new food series, Ugly Delicious, is getting a second season order, but that seems like an easy green light given the social media response and online chatter. Stay tuned for updates on all of Netflix’s food new food shows as they become available.  • Netflix Orders More Queer Eye and Nailed It As Its Unscripted Push Continues [Vulture]  • Netflix’s ‘Queer Eye’ Might Make You Cry This Weekend [E]  • 7 Reasons Why Netflix’s ‘Nailed It’ Actually Nails It [E]	1

"1. Drake Bell and Josh Peck  Getty  The stars of Nickelodeon's Drake & Josh had a falling out in June, after Josh Peck married his longtime girlfriend, Paige O'Brien, and didn't invite Drake Bell to his wedding. Drake shared his hurt on Twitter, saying, ""When you’re not invited to the wedding the message is clear ... True colors have come out today. Message is loud and clear. Ties are officially cut. I’ll miss you brotha."" He deleted the tweets, but his words live on in screenshots.  Josh Peck got married yesterday and Drake Bell just tweeted this 😭 my favorite childhood tv show brothers pic.twitter.com/Xqq0AoLuOD — Amber Leeann Secrest (@AmbySecrest) June 18, 2017  According to E! News, Drake also wrote and deleted that ""Loyalty is key... ALWAYS remember where you came from.""    A co-star who was invited to the wedding? John Stamos, from the now defunct FOX show Grandfathered. He addressed the feud thusly:  In July, Drake walked back his initial comments, telling People, ""There are no hard feelings. He’s been my best friend for 18 years. In all honesty, we talk all the time, we’ve been talking."" He expanded on that sentiment in a Facebook Live interview with Entertainment Tonight, saying:  We've been together 18 years, Josh and me ... We've been so close, it was just one of those things where you know, I'd been talking to him, and he's been telling me about the engagement. And then I saw [the wedding] on social media. So it was just one of those things where it was just like, 'You didn't even tell me?! I had to find out on social media?' And then you're like, 'You know what?! Fine!’ And then I'm like, 'Wait, I probably shouldn't have done that.'  The guys attended the MTV Video Music Awards in August and shared matching Instagram posts to prove that all was forgiven.  2. Caitlyn Jenner vs. The Kardashians  Getty  Caitlyn Jenner released her memoir, The Secrets of My Life, on April 25, sharing some less than flattering details about her relationship with Kris Jenner, to whom she was married for nearly 25 years. ""My heart breaks for my mom,"" Kim Kardashian West said on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. ""I don’t think it’s necessary. I just feel like it’s unfair, things aren’t truthful.""  Among other things, Caitlyn claimed that Kris had total control of her finances when they were married and that it was Caitlyn who came up with the idea for Keeping Up With the Kardashians, not Kris. ""It’s taken her a really long time to be honest with herself so I don’t expect her to be honest about my mom now,"" Kim told Ellen. ""But it’s just so hurtful. I wish her all the success in the world, but not at our expense.""  In October, on the season-14 premiere of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, Kim more pointedly called Caitlyn a ""liar"" and ""not a good person"" for writing that Robert Kardashian knew O.J. Simpson was guilty but joined his defense team anyway. ""If you talk about my dad,"" Kim said, ""I will cut you."" Later in the episode, Khloé called Caitlyn a ""bad, mean person"" and Kris cried via FaceTime about feeling blindsided by her ex's memoir.    Speaking to students at the U.K.’s Cambridge Union in November, Caitlyn said she hadn't talked to Kim in a year. (And she'd previously said she hadn't talked to Kris since the release of her book.) ""It’s been a little tough over the last couple of years on the Kardashian side,"" she said, according to the Cambridge News (via Us Weekly). ""To be honest, I don’t talk to them anymore. Kim I haven’t talked in a year. They don’t want me in their lives, they bashed me pretty badly. It’s devastating when your kids do that. It really hurt. I don’t know what the future holds. We will see.""  3. Justin Bieber vs. Marilyn Manson  Getty  Last year, Team Bieber sold a repurposed Marilyn Manson t-shirt designed by Fear of God for $195 at Barneys, but according to Marilyn, they did so without his permission. Marilyn told Consequence of Sound that Justin was wearing the t-shirt when they met ""and he said to me, 'I made you re"	0

"It's been over a month since Maddie Poppe was crowned the new American Idol, and her relationship with fellow contestant, and runner-up, Caleb Lee Hutchinson, is still going strong.  The talented lovebirds spoke with ET's Lauren Zima during rehearsals for the upcoming American Idol Live! 2018 Tour -- and they gushed over getting to sing with one another while also dating.  ""It's awesome!"" Poppe, 20, marveled. ""I mean, it's like we get each other. We're already reading each other's minds, knowing what were gonna do next.""  ""Yeah. It's weird,"" Hutchinson, 19, chimed in. ""It's like dueting with yourself, almost.""  The pair revealed their season-long relationship during the American Idol finale on May 21, after managing to keep their romance under wraps throughout the competition.  After Poppe was named the winner, Hutchinson took to Instagram to share a celebratory message alongside a photo of them hugging on stage during the finale.  He congratulated her on the big win, writing, ""No one deserved it more than you babe. I am honored to know you and even more honored to call you mine. Don’t forget about me. I love you.""  Hutchinson told ET that he was ""just joking"" when he added the off-handed quip about Poppe forgetting him, but said that a lot of critics took it a little too seriously.  ""There are so many like blogs on the internet that are like, 'Caleb is already showing signs of insecurity. [It's] the downfall of their relationship,'"" Hutchinson shared in a mocking tone, clearly rejecting the very notion.  Back in May, ET caught up with the happy pair just moments after Poppe was declared the season's big winner, and they opened up on how and why they stayed quiet about dating.  ""[We met] the first day of Hollywood Week and we haven’t really spent any time apart since then,” he dished. “It was one of those things where I didn’t want it to affect anything, and I didn’t want to exploit my feelings for her ‘cause they’re very, very real. Once voting was over, I was like, ‘Shoot, I want the world to know.'""  Check out the video below to hear more from the cute couple about their burgeoning romance.

New Yorker Cyndi Lauper, born Cynthia Ann Stephanie Lauper, released her debut album She's So Unusual in 1983. The album produced four megahits Girls Just Want to Have Fun, Time After Time, She Bop, and All Through the Night. Her next two albums were also successes. Lauper went on to sell more than 25 million albums. Then she faded away. However, Cyndi is far from being a failure. She has worldwide record sales of 50 million and has won Grammy, Emmy, and Tony awards, which is a rare feat.  Michigan native Madonna Louise Ciccone released her first single in 1982 and is still a big name in music 30 years later. She's sold more than 300 million records worldwide. She's the best-selling female recording artist of all time according to the Guinness Book of World Records. Not only is she a successful singer, she's an entrepreneur, actress, author and director. She's become a musical icon and has influenced many of today's young female artists.  So, why did Cyndi Lauper fade away while Madonna continues to have commercial success and iconic status?	0
Wonder Woman's Lasso of Truth is a weapon which is proven to be Indestructible. It has been able to hold Superman,Captain Marvel, Ares etc. Physically, it can't be broken , it can only be escaped(very rare case).  But, sometimes it has been shown that the bound of lasso of truth broke when the truth itself was challenged by wonder woman herself.Physically, nobody has been able to do any damage to the Lasso of Truth.  Few characters who have escaped from the bound of the Lasso of Truth are Bizarro,Qween of Fables, Rama khan and Amazo.But, somehow Wonder Woman was responsible for it, as her pride and overconfidence came in her way of judgement.  During Endgame, Joker uses a toxin to turn the whole Justice League against Batman. And during an one-on-one battle with Wonder Woman, Batman was able to escape the bound of Lasso of truth . Batman uses the blind of veils(Lasso of Lie) created by Hephaestus(Creator of Lasso of Truth) to escape .  Fun Fact- (Batman has also been able to build his own version of Lasso of Truth by reverse engineering the Amazo's tech of duplicating his opponent's power.)	1

"Julia Roberts and Danny Moder’s love story is one for the ages. The couple, who are celebrating 16 years of marriage in July, are stronger than they’ve ever been. Despite experiencing their fair share of ups and downs, the A-list couple is in it for the long haul.  “When you see them together, there is no doubt about it. They still have crazy passion and love for each other,” a source reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly, noting that the pair’s secret to success is “always making time for each other.”  Although the Wonder star, 50, and the cinematographer, 49, have faced challenges throughout their relationship, they always “come out on the other side very much together,” adds the insider. “They have a really solid, loving marriage.”  Their strong bond has helped them remain a united front for their three children, twins Hazel and Phinaeus, 13, and Henry, 10. The duo, who are very “hands-on parents,” the source says, love their “simple, laid-back life in Malibu, attending school functions and community events.”  9 PHOTOS Julia Roberts and Danny Moder together See Gallery Julia Roberts and Danny Moder together BEVERLY HILLS, CA - JANUARY 11: Danny Moder and Julia Roberts attend the 3rd annual Sean Penn & Friends HELP HAITI HOME Gala benefiting J/P HRO presented by Giorgio Armani at Montage Beverly Hills on January 11, 2014 in Beverly Hills, California.

"Character in A Song of Ice and Fire  Arya Stark is a fictional character in American author George R. R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire epic fantasy novel series. She is a prominent point of view character in the novels with the third most viewpoint chapters, and is the only viewpoint character to have appeared in every published book of the series.  Introduced in 1996's A Game of Thrones, Arya is the third child and younger daughter of Lord Eddard Stark and his wife Lady Catelyn Stark. She is tomboyish, headstrong, feisty, independent, disdains traditional female pursuits, and is often mistaken for a boy. She wields a smallsword named Needle, a gift from her half-brother, Jon Snow, and is trained in the Braavosi style of sword fighting by Syrio Forel.  Arya is portrayed by English actress Maisie Williams in HBO's Emmy-winning television adaptation of the novel series, Game of Thrones.[1][2] Her performance has garnered critical acclaim, particularly in the second season for her work opposite veteran actor Charles Dance (Tywin Lannister) when she served as his cupbearer.[3] She is among the most popular characters in either version of the story.[4][5] Williams was nominated for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series for the role in 2016.[6] She and the rest of the cast were nominated for Screen Actors Guild Awards for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016 and 2017.  Character [ edit ]  Background [ edit ]  Arya is the third child and younger daughter of Eddard and Catelyn Stark and is nine years old at the beginning of the book series. She has five siblings: an older brother Robb, an older sister Sansa, two younger brothers Bran and Rickon, and an older illegitimate half-brother, Jon Snow.  Description [ edit ]  Arya is left-handed and talented in sums and housekeeping, and is excellent at horse-riding. In contrast to her more praised sister Sansa, who favors activities traditionally befitting a noblewoman and expresses disdain for outdoor activities, Arya shows no interest in dancing, singing and sewing, and revels in fighting and exploring, much to the chagrin of her mother and household tutor Septa Mordane. She is described as ""wolf-blooded"", blunt, impulsive and ""always difficult to tame"" by her mother, and was given the nickname ""Arya Underfoot"" by the guards of Winterfell. She is particularly close to her bastard half-brother Jon Snow, who encourages her to learn how to fight and gives her the smallsword Needle.[7] The sword is well suited to Arya's slender build and her favored ""Water Dance"" (fencing) style which emphasizes speed and agility with a thin, light rapier used in quick thrusting attacks. Throughout her travels, Arya displays great resourcefulness and cunning and also becomes increasingly ruthless.  Arya is the only one out of her full-siblings to inherit the Stark features and is said to resemble her late aunt Lyanna in both looks and temperament.[8] At the start of the series, she is generally regarded as messy and plain-looking, and often mistaken for a boy; but there are multiple instances in the books of her (favorable) comparison to the beautiful Lyanna,[8] and catching the eye of men later on in the series. She is also a skinchanger, capable of telepathically possessing her direwolf Nymeria in dreams, as well as psychically bonding with a street tomcat in Braavos.[9]  Storylines [ edit ]  Novels [ edit ]  A Game of Thrones [ edit ]  Coat of arms of House Stark  Arya adopts a direwolf cub, which she names Nymeria after a legendary warrior queen. She travels with her father, Eddard, to King's Landing when he is made Hand of the King. Before she leaves, her half-brother Jon Snow has a smallsword made for her as a parting gift, which she names ""Needle"" after her least favorite ladylike activity.  While taking a walk together, Prince Joffrey and her sister Sansa happen upon Arya and her friend, the low-born butcher appr"	1
Awkwafina and Laverne Cox will announce the nominees for the 25th annual Screen Actors Guild Awards on Wednesday at the Pacific Design Center in West Hollywood, Calif. Beginning 10 a.m. ET/PT, the nominations will be carried live on TNT, TBS, and truTV.  SAG-AFTRA president Gabrielle Carteris will introduce Awkwafina and Cox.

The 25th annual SAG Awards ceremony will be simulcast live on TNT and TBS on Sunday, Jan. 27, 2019 at 8 p.m. ET/PT.

"The duo are reteaming once more after the network fired Cooper's co-host Kathy Griffin in 2017 for posing with what appeared to be a decapitated Trump head.  CNN on Tuesday announced that Anderson Cooper and Andy Cohen will host the network's upcoming New Year's Eve celebration in New York for a second year in a row, while Don Lemon and Brooke Baldwin will do their part in the Central time zone.  ""Getting to ring in the New Year with Andy is a total joy and I can’t wait for the big night!"" Cooper said in a statement, while Cohen remarked, ""Who would’ve thought 25 years of friendship would lead to an almost-tradition of co-hosting New Year’s Eve on CNN!?""  Added Bravo's Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen host, ""I’m so excited to spend New Year’s with my friend again and promise not to complain about the bitter cold!""  CNN's New Year's Eve show first aired 11 years ago and, up until May 2017, was previously hosted by Cooper and his former friend Kathy Griffin. Griffin was fired from her post last spring after she posed for a controversial photo in which she was shown holding what appears to be the decapitated head of President Donald Trump.  Griffin apologized, but later retracted any expression of remorse. Cooper publicly condemned Griffin for taking the photo and the comedian has since revealed that her friendship with the CNN anchor ended because of the scandal.  CNN will live-stream New Year's Eve coverage, without requiring log-in to a cable provider, on Dec. 31 from 8 p.m.-1:05 a.m. ET."	1
"Listen below to the five nominees up for this year's Academy Award for Best Original Song.  Winners of this year's Oscars will be announced on Sunday, March 4, 2016, at the Dolby Theatre at Hollywood & Highland Center in Hollywood.  ""Mighty River,"" from ""Mudbound""  Music and Lyric by Mary J. Blige, Raphael Saadiq and Taura Stinson  Time tells no lies  It keeps changing, and ticking, and moving,  then passes by  But if you're lucky, it will be kind  Like a river flowing through time  Singer Mary J. Blige received two Oscar nominations this year – for co-writing this Best Original Song nominee, and for Best Supporting Actress, for her performance as Florence in this period drama about a sharecropping family in the post-war South.  While the film unnecessarily veers at times towards the melodramatic, Blige's acting performance is delicately shaded and real -- and her musical performance of ""Mighty River"" is soulful and inspiring.  ""Mystery of Love,"" from ""Call Me by Your Name""  Music and Lyric by Sufjan Stevens  How much sorrow can I take?  Blackbird on my shoulder  And what difference does it make  When this love is over?  Shall I sleep within your bed  River of unhappiness  Hold your hands upon my head  Till I breathe my last breath  Oh, oh woe-oh-woah is me  The last time that you touched me  Oh, will wonders ever cease?  Blessed be the mystery of love  Singer-songwriter Sufjan Stevens wrote two songs (including ""Mystery of Love"") for Luca Guadagnino's Best Picture nominee, ""Call Me By Your Name,"" about a teenage boy spending a summer in Italy who falls into a romance with an older man.  The music captures the idealism, fantasy and disappointments of first love. And while the film is a memory piece, the music is ever-present, keeping the innocence and heartbreak of youth at the fore.  ""Remember Me,"" from ""Coco""  Music and Lyric by Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez  Remember me  Though I have to say goodbye  Remember me  Don't let it make you cry  For ever if I'm far away  I hold you in my heart  I sing a secret song to you  Each night we are apart  Anderson-Lopez and Lopez previously won for ""Let It Go"" from the Disney animated film ""Frozen."" For Pixar's animated tale inspired by Mexico's Day of the Dead, they contributed a lovely bi-lingual song about memory and family that is played in a variety of styles -- including a lullaby, a boisterous ranchera song, and a romantic ballad.  ""Stand Up For Something"" from ""Marshall""  Music by Diane Warren; Lyric by Lonnie R. Lynn and Diane Warren  It all means nothing  If you don't stand up for something  You can't just talk the talk  You got to walk that walk, yes you do  It all means nothing  If you don't stand up for something  For Reginald Hudlin's biopic of lawyer and future Supreme Court Justice Thurgood Marshall, Lonnie R. Lynn and Diane Warren composed a song about ethics and dignity. Andra Day's powerful performance elevates the song beyond the film's 1950s storyline, to make it timeless.  Lynn previously won the Oscar for ""Glory"" (from ""Selma""). Warren has eight previous nominations.  ""This Is Me,"" from ""The Greatest Showman""  Music and Lyric by Benj Pasek and Justin Paul  When the sharpest words wanna cut me down  I'm gonna send a flood, gonna drown them out  I am brave, I am bruised  I am who I'm meant to be, this is me  Look out 'cause here I come  And I'm marching on to the beat I drum  I'm not scared to be seen  I make no apologies, this is me  The song in the video clip above featuring Keala Settle, from the P.T. Barnum musical biopic ""The Greatest Showman,"" exudes pride and defiance about overcoming prejudice and ignorance. Like the film, it makes no apologies about not being subtle.  The songwriters Benj Pasek and Justin Paul previously shared an Oscar win (""City of Stars"") and a nomination (""Audition"") for ""La La Land.""  See also:  For more info:"	1
"Wedding of British royal Prince Harry to Meghan Markle  The wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle was held on 19 May 2018 in St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle in the United Kingdom. The groom, Prince Harry, is a member of the British royal family; the bride, Meghan Markle, is American and previously worked as an actress.[note 1] On the morning of the wedding, Prince Harry's grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, conferred upon him the titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. On her marriage, Markle became Duchess of Sussex,[1] Countess of Dumbarton[2] and Baroness Kilkeel.[3] The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, officiated at the wedding using the standard Anglican church service for Holy Matrimony published in Common Worship, the liturgical text of the Church of England.[4][5] The traditional ceremony was noted for the inclusion of African American culture.[6]  Announcement of engagement [ edit ]  Prince Harry is the second son of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Diana, Princess of Wales. He and Meghan Markle, an American actress best known for her role in the Canadian-American legal-drama television series Suits, have been in a relationship since 2016, having first met in July 2016.[7] The relationship was officially acknowledged on 8 November 2016, when a statement was released from the royal family's communications secretary addressing the ""wave of abuse and harassment"" directed toward Markle.[8]  Harry and Meghan attending church on Christmas Day, 2017  On 27 November 2017, Clarence House announced that Prince Harry would marry Markle in the spring of 2018.[9] They were engaged earlier the same month in London, with the Prince giving Markle a bespoke engagement ring made by Cleave and Company, the court jewellers and medalists to the Queen, consisting of a large central diamond from Botswana, with two smaller diamonds from his mother's jewellery collection.[10][note 2] At the same time, it was announced that they would live at Nottingham Cottage in the grounds of Kensington Palace following their marriage.[13]  The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh expressed their delight at the news, while congratulations came in from various political leaders, including the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, and the Leader of the Opposition, Jeremy Corbyn. After the announcement, the couple gave an exclusive interview to Mishal Husain of BBC News.[13]  During the public announcement of the engagement at Kensington Palace's Sunken Gardens, Markle wore a bottle knee-length emerald green dress with bow detailing at the cinched waist by Italian label P.A.R.O.S.H and a white trench coat by Canadian brand Line the Label.[14][15] Hours after the announcement, the website of Line the Label crashed down due to the number of people who were trying to order the coat.[10][16]  Markle is the second American[note 3] and the first person of mixed race heritage to marry into the British royal family.[17] The engagement announcement prompted much comment about the possible social significance of Markle becoming a proudly mixed-race royal.[18][19][20][21][22]  Under the terms of the Succession to the Crown Act 2013, the first six persons in the line of succession require the Sovereign's consent in order to marry. Harry was fifth in line at the time of his engagement.[23] The Queen's consent was declared to the Privy Council of the United Kingdom on 14 March 2018.[24][25]  Although Markle attended a private Catholic school in her early years, she is not Roman Catholic.[26] On 6 March 2018, she was baptised and confirmed into the Church of England by the Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby at St. James's Palace.[27] Although Markle was divorced, the Anglican Church has permitted marriage to divorced persons with a living former spouse since 2002.[28][29] After the engagement, Markle began the years-long process of becoming a British citizen.[30] She will retain her U.S. citizenship during the process,[31] but Kensington Palace "	1

    Giraffe kisses! April the giraffe’s calf has met his dad, Oliver, and it made for the most precious, heartwarming photo ever!  Animal Adventure Park in Harpursville, New York, tweeted the adorable snap of the father-son introduction on Tuesday, April 18. In the pic, Oliver leans down and touches his baby’s nose through a fence. (Oliver is currently separated from April and the calf for their safety.) “Dad & Baby meet!” the tweet read.  The zoo owner, Jordan Patch, told Good Morning America on Monday, April 17, that it’s rare for male giraffes to help with their newborns’ upbringing. “Oliver — usually males have no part in raising of the young — [but] he’s actually been quite inquisitive and getting nose to nose with baby,” he said. “It’s creating some very cute moments.”  As fans all over the world saw via livestream, April the giraffe gave birth to her fourth calf on Saturday, April 15, after 16 months of pregnancy. Approximately 1.2 million people watched as she welcomed the baby, who weighed 129 pounds and measured 5 feet, 9 inches.  Celebrity Moms and Dads Show Off Cuddly Pictures of Their Kids and Pets  The newborn giraffe doesn’t yet have a name since Animal Adventure Park is holding a contest to name the calf. Animal lovers everywhere can submit a name for the baby until April 25 at nameaprilscalf.com. Each submission costs $1 with a minimum purchase of five name suggestions for $5. At the end of the voting period, the zoo will open another voting contest with the 10 most popular names. All proceeds will benefit giraffe conservation events, the zoo and Ava’s Little Heroes, a charity for families who face unexpected medical expenses.	1
"Following their recent reconciliation, Jenny Slate and Chris Evans appeared to celebrate Christmas together on Monday.  Slate was snapped with Evans’ younger brother, Scott, in a photo posted on Instagram.  “Christmas with my favorite Jew! @jennyslate,” the Captain America star's sibling captioned a pic with Slate.  While Slate didn’t post any photos from the festivities herself, she signaled she was taking a break from social media in a selfie posted on Thursday.  “Before i jump off Instagram for a much needed unplug, i would also love to offer my lifetime devotion to this cape and scarf from @jcrew bc i feel like a powerful poodle in these gifts. Xo,” she wrote.  ET learned in November that Evans, 36, and Slate, 35, were giving their relationship another chance after calling it quits in January.  During the same month, Slate confirmed she had a “dreamy” boyfriend on Twitter.  ""My boyfriend does many dreamy & generous things but number 1 in my mind right now is how he celebrates my new turtlenecks/let’s me show him my online shopping spoils & cheers me on,"" the comedian wrote.

Big news for fans of Scandal and Grey’s Anatomy as ShondaLand has announced two new spinoffs featuring Jessica Capshaw and Darby Stanchfield!  When news broke that Jessica Capshaw and Sarah Drew were being let go from Grey’s Anatomy, fans were rightly upset. Luckily for those diehard Arizona Robbins fans, ShondaLand has revealed that the character will be getting her very own spinoff!  Like Private Practice, the new series (which is still untitled) will follow Arizona as she sets off on a new adventure. This time, Arizona will be moving to New York to be closer to her daughter who had moved there with Callie.  As seen on Grey’s Anatomy, Sofia was having a hard time returning to Seattle to visit Arizona. It clearly made things harder for both mother and daughter. This will lead to Arizona deciding to move to New York.  It’s not yet clear if this means that Arizona will also try to rekindle things with her ex-wife, given that Sara Ramirez has seemingly moved on from her character of Callie. But fans can always hope!  Either way, we’re excited to hear that Jessica Capshaw won’t be leaving the Grey’s Anatomy universe after all!  Meanwhile, Scandal may air its final episode on April 19, but the Gladiators aren’t going anywhere!  Expected to release in the fall of 2018, the Scandal spinoff, Gladiator Wanted will return as a web-only series. Airing new episodes each Thursday (is there really any other day), the series will pick up the pieces following the series finale.  Back in 2016, the series produced a limited digital-only spinoff starring some of the original cast. With the focus on elections, Olivia Pope’s family, and other more pressing matters in the West Wing, it’s easy for Scandal to forget about the little guys. Namely those who make the series what it is – the Gladiators.  While casting is under wraps (can’t spoil who will or will not survive the current season), we expect that some familiar voices and faces may appear in front of and behind the camera. Could Darby Stanchfield, who directed all six episodes of Gladiator Wanted return? Recently she made her Scandal directorial debut with season 7’s “The Noise.”  Who else will stop by for another bite of Scandal? Should they survive, our money is on Huck (Guillermo Diaz), Charlie (George Newbern), and Quinn (Katie Lowes). Seeing as they were involved in the first spinoff, and are the heart of the current QPA operation, it makes sense that they would swing by for a guest spot or two!  The only original cast member we’re speculating will not return is Marcus, played by Cornelius Smith Jr. He made a nice pitch for his character to eventually head over to HTGAWM during the crossover event.  Are you excited the Gladiators are not hanging up their white hats just yet?  April Fools!	1
"Trouble in paradise? Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes were first spotted dancing together in the Hamptons in 2013 — just one year after she split from Tom Cruise. Although Jamie and Katie have never confirmed their romance, they have been spotted on date nights and canoodling plenty of times over the past several years. But recently, tension has been high between them as Jamie is getting a bit jealous of Katie's friendship with former flame Joshua Jackson.  The 50-year-old Sleepless star was overheard venting about his tumultuous relationship with Katie while hanging out at Coachella. ""He didn't seem to care who heard him,"" the source exclusively told In Touch. Jamie admitted that not only was Katie talking to Joshua again, but he was also ""hurt"" by it.  (Photo Credit: Getty Images)  It's imprtant to note that Katie and Joshua go way back, which is why Jamie probably ""seemed pretty cut up by everything."" The former Dawson's Creek co-stars dated in the '90s and Katie admitted during an interview with Rolling Stone in 1998 that Joshua was her first love.  When asked about their relationship, a then 19-year-old Katie said, ""I'm just going to say that I met somebody last year, I fell in love, I had my first love, and it was something so incredible and indescribable."" She added, ""I feel so fortunate because he's now one of my best friends. It's weird, it's almost like a Dawson-and-Joey type thing now.""  (Photo Credit: Getty Images)  The pair broke things off before Katie went on to date Chris Klein for five years before marrying Tom in 2006. However, Katie and Joshua have always kept in touch despite other relationships. Surprisingly, she reached out to Joshua following her split from Tom in 2012.  ""Like any old friend, it was like, 'Oh, hi, how are ya? What's going on?'; 'I had a kid,'"" Joshua told a Canadian talk show host about the phone call with Katie. ""It was very nice, actually.""  So, does Jamie have a reason to be worried? That's a tricky question, but Jamie isn't as innocent as he seems — because he's been texting his ex, too! At the beginning of March, sources exclusively told In Touch that Katie is starting to suspect that Jamie and his baby mama Kristin Grannis are more than just friends. ""She recently found out about a string of texts Jamie sent to Kristin that included details of secret meetings — and him admitting he still loved her,"" the insider said. And Jamie's latest act of betrayal is him showing ""a blatant lack of respect.""

"Chris Rock is opening up about his intense divorce.  The 52-year-old comedian and his ex wife, Malaak Compton-Rock, split in 2014 after 19 years of marriage, and their divorce was finalized last August. They share two daughters together, 12-year-old Zahara and 14-year-old Lola. Rock covers Rolling Stone's latest issue, and in the revealing cover story, talks about his complicated marriage.  The story includes bits of Rock's stand-up routines over the past few months, in which he says he was unfaithful during the relationship.  NEWS: Chris Rock's Daughter's Girl Scout Cookies Brought Us 8 of the Greatest Moments in Oscar History  ""I was a piece of sh**,"" he tells the crowd during one comedy show.  According to the magazine, he later talks about his affairs and ""gets disarmingly specific, describing three women: one famous, one semifamous, and one a member of the retail class."" Now, the actor is clearly jaded to the idea of marriage.  ""Would I ever get married again?"" he says. ""Not if it would cure AIDS.""  Rolling Stone  The Grown Ups 2 star also talks about his fame in the interview, and how it played into the divorce.  ""My faults are magnified,"" he says. ""Your significant other, if they really love you, has a high opinion of you. And you let them down.""  Still, he says he's now toned down talking about his marriage out of respect for his ex-wife.  ""It's not fair,"" he notes. ""I have a mic, she doesn't. God forbid people are bugging her in the supermarket. That's not cool. I'm going to have to see her at weddings and graduations.""  Rock says he's never had a breakdown about his split, though admits he cried once during their custody battle.  ""We live in a world where men are assumed to not have feelings,"" he shares. ""All my friends assume I moved into the city after my divorce, away from my girls. When I say I bought a house around the corner, it blows their minds.""  The Saturday Night Live alum at one point gets candid while talking to the Rolling Stone writer, who is married with a toddler.  ""You got a kid now. You'll be fine. You need each other,"" he notes. ""Need is big. A woman breaks up with you, the first thing she says is 'I don't need this sh**.' She doesn’t say, 'I don't love you,' she says she doesn't need you.""  ""My own daughter has blocked me on Instagram,"" he adds. ""They grow up so quick.""  Now, the comedian says he's in the middle of ""starting over.""  ""Getting divorced, you have to f**king start over,"" he says. ""You get to reset. It's not a breakdown, but something in your life broke down.""  EXCLUSIVE: Kevin Hart Supports Chris Rock  Still, Rock has plenty of A-list friends to help him through. Last December, Amy Schumer Instagrammed a pic of her and Rock alongside Leslie Jones, Michael Che, Sam Morril and Colin Jost, the group enjoying themselves sitting courtside at a New York Knicks game.

Don’t get us wrong, Nicole Kidman can do no wrong.  But just know if the Top Of The Lake: China Girl actress’ red carpet look at all reminds you of Glinda the Good Witch (The Wizard of Oz reference, y’all), know you’re not alone.  Hear us out: Yes, there’s no denying the Zuhair Murad dress is a masterpiece (just look at all that detail), there’s also no denying there’s a lot going on. All at once. Between the ruffled cuffs and neckline, the underlying, intricate beading and embroidery work, the small velvet bows and back cutouts, the crystal-embellished belt and the heavy tulle overlay, the gown is doing multiple things at once. Too many things? Well, that’s for you to decide.	1
Advertisement  Katy Perry has treated her closest friends and family members to new $7.5 million guest home in Los Angeles, more than a year after putting her own Hollywood Hills mansion on the market.  The four bedroom, five bathroom property in upscale Beverly Hills will reportedly be used communally by those closest to the American star, whose bid to offload her listed home resulted the price being lowered in July.  Spread over 4,400 square feet, the lavish Spanish style house includes tasteful French doors, a large outdoor area and sweeping manicured lawns.  Generous gesture: Katy Perry has treated her closest friends and family members to new $7.5 million guest home in Los Angeles, more than a year after putting her own Hollywood Hills mansion on the market  Lovely: The four bedroom, five bathroom property in upscale Beverly Hills will reportedly be used communally by those closest to the American star, whose bid to offload her listed home resulted the price being lowered in July  A large outdoor pool and seating area affords tenants plenty of space to relax and unwind, while its acres of space is perfect for those hoping to make the most of the balmy Californian sunshine.  The property is nestled within the heart of an exclusive gated community, with previous celebrity residents including Adele, Ellen Degeneres, Jennifer Lawrence and married couple Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis.  Neutral decor and minimalist furnishings prove to be recurring theme throughout the home, with a tasteful living room featuring fitted bookshelves surrounding a large, widescreen television.

The American singer, 33, was said to be open to offers of $8.95 million (£6,741,274) for the Mediterranean style property, which encompasses a four bedroom house, guest house, security building, separate fitness studio and an enormous outdoor pool.  Katy originally listed the sprawling home 13-months ago, but a lack of offers is understood to have resulted in a modest reduction on its original $9.285 million valuation.  Despite the marginally lower price, Katy is still set to make a modest profit from the property she purchased from heiress Aileen Getty for $8.2 million.

God save Meghan Markle! The Duchess Of Sussex has run into some issues when it comes to her royal behavior, but she has her husband Prince Harry to support her through it!  Meghan Markle was just accused of breaking royal protocol and “disrespecting the Queen” when she crossed her legs at a royal engagement. Shortly after, she attempted to hold Prince Harry’s hand in public — which just isn’t what the royals do. Still, she’s only been a Duchess for a month and a half, so the Royal Family is cutting her some slack, even though she’s incredibly hard on herself. “Meghan does worry about messing up, she worries terribly, because she wants to do everything perfectly, so she really beats herself up when she gets even the tiniest thing wrong. But, there is so much to remember, so many minuscule little details, it’s kind of mind-blowing really–and all incredibly high pressured too, as it’s all under a microscope at the same time,” a palace insider told HollywoodLife.com exclusively.  “The funny thing is that the Queen is actually incredibly gracious to Meghan, she doesn’t put any pressure on her at all, it’s actually quite the opposite, and Harry is so loving and supportive, he’s constantly telling Meghan how amazing she’s doing, and how quickly she’s learning, and she is!” Aww! Listen, if the Queen doesn’t have a problem, we don’t have a problem.  At Meghan and Harry’s royal nuptials on May 18, the duchess seemed ready to commit to her role as a royal — singing God Save The Queen flawlessly, and crossing her legs at her ankles. Her few faux pas, while understandable to the royal family, are reportedly devastating to her. “The British press is constantly jumping on each and every little faux pas though, and publicly reprimanding Meghan, it’s horrible really, and some days she ends up in tears,” the insider revealed. “Harry is so protective of Meghan, and he hates how some of the newspapers write about her, it reminds him of his mother, and the way she was treated by the press, and sometimes Harry worries that nothing has really changed.” Recall, the British tabloids were incredibly tough on Princess Diana, but if Meghan is anything like her she’ll continue to handle herself with impeccable class!	0

"Kim Kardashian and Kanye West welcomed the arrival of their third child, a baby girl, via surrogate on Monday, Jan. 15. According to TMZ, the couple has been fielding absurd offers to supply photos of the newborn months before the birth, but they have continually refused.  Various outlets were offering more than a million dollars, and even $2-5 million, for the photos. In the past, Kim and Kanye waited until North and Saint were two months old before posting their first photos online.  TMZ also reports that Kim was in the hospital room during the delivery, and was the first person to have skin-to-skin contact with the baby. Kanye was in the delivery room as well, but remained behind a curtain as to give the surrogate some privacy during birth. He held the baby after she was born.  Kim made the announcement on her website shortly after the baby's arrival. ""Kanye and I are happy to announce the arrival of our healthy, beautiful baby girl,"" she wrote. ""We are incredibly grateful to our surrogate who made our dreams come true with the greatest gift one could give and to our wonderful doctors and nurses for their special care. North and Saint are especially thrilled to welcome their baby sister.​""  POST CONTINUES BELOW  A source told People that Kanye is a ""hands-on"" dad. “Kanye says that his children have saved his life,” the insider further explained. “This one in particular came along after a very dark time. He’s so in love with his kids.” The couple endured a difficult 2016: Kim was robbed in Paris and Kanye was hospitalized for a nervous breakdown. But it seems that with the arrival of the new baby, the two are bouncing back."	1

"Now that Season 2 of 13 Reasons Why has officially been confirmed, just about everyone who found themselves emotionally invested in the first series has some theory about what the next chapter will have to offer - including main stars Dylan Minnette and Katherine Langford.  What we know so far is that the next season will definitely still be Hannah-centric and will delve into the repurcussions of her suicide. Katherine - who played Hannah in the series, told E! News that there are still a lot of loose ends looking to be tied up in the story.  Copyright [Getty]  ""Personally, I would be interested to see…more discussion into what’s happening afterward,"" she told E! News. ""It’s interesting that in the first season we get to see what the characters go through post-Hannah’s death. I think Jessica has a really interesting story to tell — and recovery to make.”  Netflix  While most fans would agree that they're looking for Bryce to be brought to justice, Dylan is hoping that the next series will be slightly less vicious on our heartstrings: “Maybe some smiles?” he told E!. “Well, there were smiles...there will be some smiles...there will be some tears. So I am just excited to see what they’re writing up for us.”  YES. Us too. Now let's catch up with Katherine and Dylan revealing what they love about each other the most IRL:"	1
Take a seat on the bench, Michael Strahan! Now it’s A-Rod who’s getting all the playing time on TV.  “Alex Rodriguez is everywhere!” an insider exclusively told RadarOnline.com. “Michael is feeling overshadowed — even though he’s six-foot-five!”  According to sources, A-Rod’s goal is to unseat Strahan as the “top jock” on the tube — and his ambition has the former football great watching his blind side.  PHOTOS: J.Lo’s Nightmare! Alex Rodriguez’s Fitness Model Mistress Spotted For First Time  “They both have massive egos,” the source spilled. “Michael is seething that all anybody talks about is A-Rod.”  The once-disgraced Yankee All-Star, 43, is FOX Sports’ lead MLB analyst. He also is a judge on “Shark Tank” — and ABC stunned Strahan when they named Alex a contributor to “Good Morning America,” without his input.  “Michael was irate,” a source spilled. “He immediately felt threatened that Alex is being groomed to replace him.”  PHOTOS: Inside Alex Rodriguez’s Raunchy Past Of Affairs, Sex Secrets & Scandals  Of course, Strahan, 46, should be used to sneaky end-arounds.  In April 2016, he shocked his “Live!” co-host Kelly Ripa, informing her he was leaving the show for “GMA” mere minutes before they went live.  “He knows how cutthroat TV can be,” the source spilled.  PHOTOS: Top Ten Most Raunchy Details About A-Rod’s Steamy Affair With Lauren Hunter  But ABC doesn’t seem to care Rodriguez’s reputation is a train wreck compared to squeaky-clean Strahan. Rodriguez was heading for baseball’s Hall of Fame until he was caught using steroids and suspended for the entire 2014 season.  Now, sources report, A-Rod is trying to use TV stardom to rebuild his tarnished legacy — and doesn’t care who he has to climb over to achieve his goal!  “Michael can’t believe the image renovation Alex has gotten on TV,” the source spilled. “He used to be hated.

The couple was surrounded by their closest friends and family, including Javid's Bravo co-stars.  The 45-year-old reality star got engaged to the marketing professional in 2015 after over a year of dating.

"Kim Kardashian is back to doing what she does best: posting photos of herself on Instagram in relatively little-to-no clothing, and giving no effs about it. Because why should she? Every body is a bikini body, and Kim looks incredible in hers, dammit!  But while Kim in a bikini isn't exactly breaking news, her caption (read: ""I'm really shy..."") essentially amounts to her trolling herself. Which, clap-clap-clap.

Emma Stone and Jennifer Lawrence became friends by texting each other every day until they got drunk on cheap wine together, and it turns out they include Brie Larson , too.  Larson spoke with Vanity Fair for its May issue about her friendships with the other A-list actresses, revealing that the trio has become each other’s support system through a group text—which also happens to include Lena Dunham and Amy Schumer. (It keeps getting better.)  The actress explained that she began to rely on the women during the grueling and uncomfortable process of promoting her Oscar-winning work in Room . “I felt lonely and bad sometimes. I was embarrassed to keep talking about myself,” she said.  An unexpected but “beautiful” email from Stone and a text from Lawrence, turned into powerful relationships.  “That [group of friends] saved my life,” she said. “I was able to talk with them about everything that was going on in my life, and it was with people who had been through it before and are also hilarious. That support and acceptance was everything. I was home-schooled, so I didn’t have friends that had the same interests as me, and I found it to be absolutely incredible.”  This isn’t the first time Larson has gushed about her celebrity comrades. After the 2017 Academy Awards, Larson posted a picture to Instagram of her embracing a tearful Stone. But the duo’s cute Oscars behavior extends back even farther than this year. Larson revealed to Vanity Fair that last year, when she was nominated, Stone gave her a good luck card alongside a gift: the book I Can Fly .  “It’s those little things,” Larson said of Stone’s gesture.  Larson also opened up about getting to know Lawrence, whom she met through costar Woody Harrelson, who had likewise introduced Stone and Lawrence. Larson explained that she and Lawrence happened to be in Montreal at the same time, and hung out every week.  “We just had a blast together, going to get dinner every Saturday night. It gave us all a chance to connect,” Larson said.  Harrelson also praised the group of actresses, calling them “a very tight-knit group who keep them honest and keep their ego in check.”  And with Larson recently snagging the coveted titular role in Captain Marvel —the first female-led Marvel superhero film—it seems Larson will be needing those friends by her side more than ever. After all, every superhero needs her sidekicks.  Read more about Larson's upcoming films and her friendships on vanityfair.com , and pick up the May issue on newsstands starting May 2.

"Pete Davidson and Ariana Grande have suddenly become pretty serious -- like, tattoo serious.  Fresh off finally revealing that they were officially a couple in an adorable Harry Potter-themed Instagram post, Davidson has taken it to the next level. The Saturday Night Live star just got two fresh new tattoos, one on his neck, the other on his right thumb, and both appear to be tributes to his new girlfriend.  The neck tattoo shows a black bunny mask, mirroring the one worn by Grande on the cover of her Dangerous Woman album. The second tattoo, on his thumb, is of her initials, ""AG.""  Photos of the tattoos were posted on social media on Saturday by Los Angeles tattoo artist London Reese.  ""We had a good night, somewhere in the hills of Los Angeles,"" Reese wrote on Instagram.

A day prior to showing off his new tattoos, the 24-year-old comedian opened for Dave Chapelle at the Borgata Hotel Casino and Spa in Atlantic City, New Jersey, and an eyewitness tells ET that Grande was in the audience to watch her guy's stand-up routine. While he didn't mention the 24-year-old pop star during his set, Davidson did pose for a photo with his girlfriend backstage, alongside fellow comedian Wil Sylvince.

U.S. women's figure skating Olympic team set: Bradie Tennell, Mirai Nagasu, Karen Chen  SAN JOSE, Calif. – There will be no surprises this year. The U.S. women’s Olympic figure skating team is set: Bradie Tennell, Mirai Nagasu and Karen Chen.  Unlike four years ago, when U.S. Figure Skating’s international committee chose to replace Nagasu with Ashley Wagner, the committee went by the order of the national championships, picking the first three finishers in the women’s competition at the 2018 nationals.  This means that the women’s team in Pyeongchang next month will be entirely different from the team that competed in Sochi four years ago: Wagner, Gracie Gold and Polina Edmunds. For most of the four years leading up to 2018, either Wagner or Gold, or both, were at the top of the sport domestically.  MORE: Wagner 'furious' at scoring  Each of the three women to make the team is something of a surprise. Tennell, 19, rose to prominence as recently as Thanksgiving weekend when she finished a surprising third at Skate America. That was the same competition Wagner, who finished fourth here, suddenly withdrew with an ankle infection.  Nagasu, 24, had an uneven fall season, but her attempts to land the difficult triple axel renewed her career. She won her only national title 10 years ago, in 2008. She finished fourth at the 2010 Olympic Games in Vancouver.  Chen, 18, also overcame a disappointing fall season. She won the 2017 national title and finished fourth at the worlds in Helsinki, helping to secure three spots for the U.S. women at the 2018 Olympics.  Wagner, 26, the only U.S. woman to win a world championship medal in the past 11 seasons (silver in 2016), was named the first alternate.  PHOTOS: Best of the 2018 U.S. Figure Skating Championship	1
Oscar Isaac in the role of painter Paul Gauguin is trouble you see coming from a mile away—the kind you live to regret falling for anyway.  He’s a holier-than-thou painting bro with a “slightly misanthropic” streak (Isaac’s generous wording), eyes glinting with disgust in his first close-up. Pipe in one hand, book in another, dressed all black save for an elegant red scarf, he slams a table and shames the Impressionists gathered around him: “They call themselves artists but behave like bureaucrats,” he huffs after a theatrical exit. “Each of them is a little tyrant.”  From a few tables away, another painter, Vincent van Gogh, watches in awe. He runs into the street after Gauguin like a puppy dog.  Within a year, a reluctant Gauguin would move in with van Gogh in a small town in the south of France, in the hope of fostering an artists’ retreat away from stifling Paris. Eight emotionally turbulent weeks later, van Gogh would lop off his left ear with a razor, distraught that his dearest friend planned to leave him for good. He enclosed the bloody cartilage in wrapping marked “remember me,” intending to have it delivered to Gauguin by a frightened brothel madam as a bizarre mea culpa. The two never spoke again.  Or so the last two years of Vincent van Gogh’s life unspool in Julian Schnabel’s At Eternity’s Gate, itself a kind of lush, post-Impressionistic memoir of the Dutchman’s tormented time in Arles, France. (Not to mention artistically fruitful time: Van Gogh churned out 200 paintings and 100 watercolors and sketches before the ear fiasco landed him in an insane asylum.)  Isaac plays Gauguin like an irresistibly bad boyfriend, a bemused air of condescension at times wafting straight into the audience: “Why’re you being so dramatic?” he scoffs directly into the camera, inflicting a first-person sensation of van Gogh’s insult and pain.  Yet in the painter’s artistic restlessness, Isaac, 39, sees himself: “That desire to want to do something new, to want to push the boundaries, to not just settle for the same old thing and get so caught up with the minutia of what everyone thinks is fashionable in the moment.” He talks about “staying true to your own idea of what’s great.” He talks about “finding something honest.”  From another actor, the sentiment might border on banal. But Oscar Isaac—Guatemalan-born, Juilliard-trained and, in his four years since breaking through as film’s most promising new leading man, christened superlatives from “this generation’s Al Pacino” to the “best dang actor of his generation”—might really have reason to mean what he says. He’s crawling out the other end of a life-altering two years, one that’s encompassed personal highs, like getting married and becoming a father, and an acutely painful low: losing a parent.  He basked in another Star Wars premiere, mined Hamlet for every dimension of human experience, and weathered the worst notices of his career with Life Itself. Through it all, he says, he’s spent a lot of time in his head—reevaluating who he is, what he wants, and what matters most.  Right now, he’s aiming for a year-long break from work, his first in a decade, after wrapping next December’s Star Wars: Episode IX. “I’m excited to, like Gauguin, kind of step away from the whole thing for a bit and focus on things that are a bit more real and that matter to me,” he says.  Until then, he’s just trying “to keep moving forward as positively as I can,” easing into an altered reality. “You’re just never the same,” he says quietly. “On a cellular level, you’re a completely different person.”  When we talk, Isaac is in New York for one day to promote and attend the New York Film Festival premiere of At Eternity’s Gate. Then it’s back on a plane to London, where Pinewood Studios and Star Wars await.  Episode IX, the last of Disney’s new Skywalker trilogy, will see Isaac reprise the role of dashing Resistance pilot Poe Dameron, whose close relationship with Carrie Fisher’s General Leia evokes joy but al	1
PICTURE EXCLUSIVE: Ben Affleck enjoys lunch date with blonde mystery woman as she holds onto his arm https://t.co/T6UYZhYU7q pic.twitter.com/0PkvL8OmCM — Daily Mail Celebrity (@DailyMailCeleb) January 6, 2017    Ben Affleck is so controlling of his public image that he had PBS censor the fact that he had a slave-owning ancestor. That’s what came to mind when I saw these exclusive Daily Mail photos (we don’t have access to them, you can see them on the Daily Mail) of Affleck out with a “mystery blonde.” The two went out to lunch, for sushi, and to a bookstore. The woman is grabbing his arm like she wants to indicate that they’re together and is looking at Ben for validation. He’s trying to look away and frown but he’s grinning slightly, like he’s trying to frown, but is happy to be caught out with her. In other photos he just looks defeated, like he knows he was busted and there’s no way out of this one. So is this a business thing and are they just playing up for the cameras?  I would say that the woman could be an industry-type person, like a producer, or she might be staff. She’s wearing jeans and he’s in corduroys, which isn’t particularly business-y, but people keep it casual in LA. It’s possible that they had some kind of lunch business meeting. Anything is possible, this might not be a hookup, but look at how she’s looking at him, for approval, and look at how he’s responding. They’re at least friends who are messing with the paps.  Remember when a story came out that Ben was spotted in Miami, in an Uber, with a “mystery blonde woman?” The two allegedly looked like they’d just had a fight. That was later denied as a case of mistaken identity, which you would expect even if it was him. Ben was also spotted getting a suite at the Beverly Hills hotel with a “hot blonde.” I suspect there’s more than just one.  Many of you will point out that he’s separated from his wife, they probably have an understanding, and this is technically not cheating, if that’s even what’s going on. Whatever agreement Affleck has Garner surely involves keeping up appearances and by getting papped out with this woman he’s breaking that. Plus he’s been working so hard to maintain his image ahead of Live By Night. That’s got to sting. Maybe he’s sick of keeping up appearances though. He can only play it straight for so long.  Update: Thanks to Charlotte and our original tipster for pointing out that the sign in the bookshop window reads September 29, 2014. These photos seem old. However here’s a link to photos of Ben in September, 2014. The last two sets are from the 27th and 29th of the month. He didn’t have a beard then and he wasn’t this filled out. It’s possible that it’s after September 29 though because his looks change quickly. I wonder what is going on and if these are indeed old photos or if we’re reading the date wrong. Ben also isn’t wearing his wedding ring, but he took it off some time ago.  Update 2: Page Six reports that the woman with Affleck is a detox nurse and sober companion. The Daily Mail has updated their original story to reflect this.	0
Recognized for his lavish events, Combs considers the soirée he threw for when he won his superstar at the Hollywood Stroll of Popularity and this yr’s soirée at Burning Guy—at an “undisclosed location”—amongst his best 3.  In fact, no birthday celebration can be whole with out some A-list decor. Alternatively, in the case of Diddy’s occasions, not anything is out of succeed in—now not even the Declaration of Independence. In keeping with the superstar, he had the long-lasting American file at one in all his Fourth of July events. Now not too shabby! Whilst we might all love to have the #1 spot on his visitor lists, seems Leonardo DiCaprio is the A-lister who would have the highest spot.  There used to be so much to be informed in regards to the Grammy winner, together with the truth that his favourite article of clothes is a couple of socks.  Additionally integrated within the questionnaire used to be whether or not or now not Diddy intends to run for the White Area in 2020. The solution is not any. “Do not need to be the president,” Diddy admitted. “I need to have an excessive amount of a laugh.”	1
If you were to mentally sort the contents of your makeup bag into the categories of products you use every day — the ones you save for special occasions and those you own but never use — lip liner would most likely fall in the last category, right? But while lip pencils are is widely seen as a gratuitous extra step, they're actually the key to creating the perfect pouty lip, according to celebrity makeup artists Ash Holm and Mary Phillips.  But it's no secret that liner is the trick to creating the illusion of fuller lips. In fact, using a lip pencil to overline your lips is a classic hack, dating back to Clara Bow in the '20s and seen again on runways (and on celebs everywhere) in the '90s. The technique is simply just hard to nail without looking dated. Thankfully, Ash and Mary both reveal their tricks for a modern take on the overdrawn lip.  1. Stick with a neutral tone.  Both artists suggest sticking to a matte neutral shade when softly cheating the line to keep the look natural and current. Ash says the key is to use a nude shade with the same undertones as your skin tone that way the contrast of shades looks cohesive. For instance, if you have pink undertones, use a neutral shade with a slightly pink hue to it for your most flattering shade.  2. Start by shading in the corners.  Use a super-sharp lip pencil (Mary says the pointier the pencil, the more precise your application will be) to begin shading the corners of your lips versus following the lip line exactly, Ash says. This not only contours them, but also softens the line making the hack a little less noticeable.  3. Don't go too far outside your natural lip line.  After you've shaded in the corners, trace along your lip line while gradually veering outside of your mouth's natural perimeter as you move toward the center of your top and bottom lips — but only slightly! Both Ash and Mary agree that following your natural shape (and not going too far outside the natural border) will look the most natural, while also effectively enhancing your pout. Mary says for her clients whose faces can carry a lot more makeup, she'll shade over the cupids bow rather than along it, but adds that this can be tricky to pull off. If it looks silly, you've probably pushed it a bit too far.  4. Blend out the edges.  Ash uses a lip brush, while Mary prefers to use the warmth of her finger to pat and melt the liner into the skin. But either way, the goal is the same: to blend the edge of the liner toward the inside of the lips to soften the line.  5. Fill in the center with lipstick.  Use a lipstick shade similar to the liner for a subtler effect, or opt for a slightly lighter lipstick to emphasize the line. To complete the look, Ash uses a brush to apply a matte lipstick on the center of the top and bottom lips, blending it out toward the perimeter of the mouth. She also loves using a matte or liquid lipstick for the finishing touch, because the matte textures make the pouty effect stand out more. Mary starts off the look with matte pencil liner as well, but prefers to use a product with a gel-like formula or something with a subtle sheen on the center of the pout for a more satin finish.

And the fact that you guys are pointing toward that—that clearly doesn't always happen. If you ended up in court, it would be a spectacular nightmare.  Spectacular. I see it everywhere. Such animosity and bitterly dedicating years to destroying each other. You'll be in court and it'll be all about affairs and it'll be everything that doesn't matter. It's just awful, it looks awful. One of my favorite movies when it came out was There Will Be Blood, and I couldn't figure out why I loved this movie, I just loved this movie, besides the obvious talent of Paul T. and, you know, Daniel Day. But the next morning I woke up, and I went, Oh, my God, this whole movie is dedicated to this man and his hatred. It's so audacious to make a movie about it, and in life I find it just so sickening. I see it happen to friends—I see where the one spouse literally can't tell their own part in it, and is still competing with the other in some way and wants to destroy them and needs vindication by destruction, and just wasting years on that hatred. I don't want to live that way.  What in the past week has given you immense joy? Can you feel that right now?  It's an elusive thing. It's been a more painful week than normal—just certain things have come up—but I see joy out the window, and I can see the silhouette of palms and an expression on one of my kids' faces, a parting smile, or finding some, you know, moment of bliss with the clay. You know, it's everywhere, it's got to be found. It's the laughter of the African mother in my experience—it's got to come from the blues, to get R&B. That'll be in my book.  The Everglades | Top, $265, (for t-shirt) by Dries Van Noten / Pants, $1,295, by Giorgio Armani / Bracelet by David Yurman / Watch by Glashütte Original  Are you going to write a book?  No! I find writing too arduous.  But do you worry about the narrative others have written for you?  What did Churchill say? History will be kind to me: I know because I'll write it myself. I don't really care about protecting the narrative. That's when I get a bit pessimistic, I get in my oh-it-all-goes-away-anyway kind of thinking. But I know the people who love me know me. And that's enough for me.  Do you remember your dreams?  Yeah. A few months ago I was having frightening dreams and I'd consciously lie awake trying to ask, What can I get out of this? What can I learn from this? Those ceased. And now I have been having moments of joy, and you wake and realize it's just a dream, and I get a bit depressed for the moment. Just the moment, just glimpse moments of joy because I know I'm just in the middle of this thing now and I'm not at the beginning of it or at the end of it, just where this chapter is right now, just smack-dab in the middle. It's fucking in the middle of it and, you know, I just don't want to dodge any of it. I just want to stand there, shirt open, and take my hits and see, and see.  There's obviously incredible grief. This is like a death—  Yeah.  There's a process—  Yeah, I think for everyone, for the kids, for me, absolutely.  So is there an urge to try to—  The first urge is to cling on.  Then?  And then you've got a cliché: “If you love someone, set them free.” Now I know what it means, by feeling it. It means to love without ownership. It means expecting nothing in return. But it sounds good written. It sounds good when Sting sings it. It doesn't mean fuck-all to me until, you know—	1
Hillary Rodham Clinton hasn’t shied away from the public stage in the months since her defeat in the 2016 election. She’s been giving speeches, sitting on panels, going to the theater, and taking selfies with supporters, and this fall, she’ll be publishing a book that promises to be “her most personal memoir yet,” according to her publisher, Simon & Schuster.  The book, titled “What Happened,” will offer an intimate view of what it was like for Mrs. Clinton to run as the first female presidential candidate from a major party in United States history, in an often vicious and turbulent campaign.  Image  Ms. Clinton will explore the mistakes she made, what it was like to run against Donald J. Trump, the difficulties she has faced as a woman in politics, the role that Russian hacking played in the election, and how she recovered from the humiliating loss, according to a description of the book released by Simon & Schuster.	1
Thomas Markle has claimed that Meghan has totally cut him off after not speaking for over 10 weeks  The retired television lighting director stated he had no way of contacting his daughter after Royal aides cut off all telephone links in the wake of previous comments he made to the media regarding the Royal Family. Speaking to the Mail on Sunday, Mr Markle said: “I’m really hurt that she’s cut me off completely. “I used to have a phone number and text number for her personal aides at the Palace, but after I said a few critical words about the Royal Family changing Meghan, they cut me off.” He expressed his sadness over the fact he has no means of sending his daughter a card ahead of her birthday on August 4, stating that if he sent one to Kensington Palace it would just be “one among thousands”.  I’m really hurt that she’s cut me off completely Thomas Markle  He added that he will likely not be able to see his grandchild should Meghan and Harry have children in the imminent future. Expressing his anguish, he told the paper: “How tragic is that, to deprive a child of its grandfather because I said a few things critical of the Royal Family.” Mr Markle came under sharp criticism after it was revealed he was paid for a set of staged paparazzi photographs ahead of the Royal wedding in May. But he expressed his confusion after receiving contradicting advice on what to do in response to the scandal.  Mr Markle expressed his sadness that he may not be able to see his potential future grandchildren  He noted that a Royal aide had said the photos had “offended the Royal Family” and called on him to offer an apology. Prince Harry then reportedly contradicted this statement, noting it was “unnecessary” to issue an apology as it would only “drag the story out a few more days”. While noting that Meghan is still “everything” to him, he stated he had “just about reached his limit” with his daughter and the Royal Family. In a stark warning, he said: “They want me to be silent, they want me to just go away. But I won't be silenced.” He criticised Meghan for her “sense of superiority”, and noted he had helped make her into the “Duchess she is today”.

Jesse Tombs of Alison Events  Photo by Tec Petaja; Design and Planning by Jesse Tombs; Floral Design by Ariella Chezar  The year’s biggest trend: ""2019 is all about embracing color and new color combinations that have never been done before,"" Jesse says. ""We see the trend veering away from soft classic colors and heading in a more fun, pumped up direction."" Case in point: ""Living Coral,"" the Pantone Color of the Year. ""We see 2019 clients leaning more towards younger, fresher palettes with pops of bright and bold color that is fun, youthful and often somewhat daring,"" he adds.  Trend to do away with: ""Welcome bags! Time and time again, we see many of the expensive, well thought-out items get left behind in hotel rooms,"" he says. ""Instead, consider giving a nice bottle of wine and a handwritten note, or making a donation to your favorite local charity in the guests names honor.""  Excited for in the new year: ""We have a couple who is focused on supporting underserved communities and working with female owned and operated local businesses for their wedding day,"" he says.

""We love when clients embrace food and beverage as an integral part of the wedding celebration!""  Best planning advice: ""Get personal! Hire vendors you connect with on a personal level, not just ones that suit your aesthetic or budget,"" he says.

Would Brad Pitt be OK if Angelina Jolie adopted another child without him? A source close to Brad told HL EXCLUSIVELY about his reaction to the latest adoption rumors!  While rumors have been swirling that Angelina Jolie might adopt a seventh child, Brad Pitt won’t be adding more to his brood. A source close to the actor told us EXCLUSIVELY that his family is as big as he’d like it to be. “Brad has no desire to adopt any more children at this point in his life,” our source said. “He loves everyone of his children and does not feel the need to grow his family any bigger. He has enough kids to worry about.”  When it comes to reports that Angelina may be looking to adopt again, Brad is neither shocked, nor does he even care. “Angie always talked with Brad about expanding their family even more so Brad would not be surprised or upset if Angelina continued to adopt children,” our source went on to say. “But Brad has no interest in competing with his ex in an adoption war or trying to keep up with her in that weird way.”  All Brad cares about now is making sure he’s looking after his own kids. “Brad only wants what is best for his kids and he wants to give the kids he does have as much attention as possible,” our source added. “He doesn’t need anymore.” Rumors began that Jolie was looking to adopt after a a source told OK! magazine, “[Angelina’s] planning to adopt another child once she’s done filming and promoting Maleficent 2,” They also added that the adoption may be the result of “Empty nest syndrome,” because Angelina thinks it’s the right time to adopt because “the kids are growing up and don’t need her as much.”	0
date night with the mama.... nothing like having the privilege of this awesome woman in my corner ...  A post shared by Allison Mack (@allisonmack729) on Mar 22, 2018 at 1:30pm PDT	1
Photo: Courtesy of E! Entertainment  On this week’s episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, our A-plot was Kris Jenner’s manipulation, our B-plot was Kim Kardashian’s announcement, and our C-plot was Kourtney Kardashian’s new relationship. Jonathan Cheban isn’t going to hate on himself, so #LEGGO!  Scene 1/Cold Open:  Kourtney Kardashian entertains Kim Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian, and family ward Jonathan Cheban. Out of nowhere, Kourtney says that Jonathan is the one person to go to for advice. Jonathan agrees, while Khloé finds it funny that once upon a time, Kourtney hated Jonathan and Former Greatest Assistant of All Time Steph Shep — but now she’s attached at the hip to both of them. Kourtney, too, marvels at how the tides have changed.  Somehow, following this conversation, Jonathan proves that he may be the only one of the group with a sound mind: Khloé sneezes, and Kim says, “Gesundheit.” Khloé asks who says that word in response to a sneeze, and Jonathan says it’s Yiddish (which, it’s not). Then Kim, Kourtney, and Khloé wonder aloud what Yiddish is. They all realize that they’ve lived their whole lives thinking Yiddish was the cousin to “gibberish” and possibly had something to do with “British.” Finally, Jonathan tells them that Yiddish is a form of Hebrew, and everyone just sits in confusion. This scene was filmed on May 5, 2017.  Scene 3:  Kylie Jenner holds a Lip Kit meeting with Kourtney Kardashian and Jordyn Woods at Kris Jenner’s home. Sequestered away in the kitchen with their mom are Kris’s other daughters, Kim and Khloé. Kim tells Khloé and Kris that the night before Saint was whispering in his sleep “shoes … dada,” which tracks with his love of shoes and all things Yeezy, according to Kim. Aside from discussing the littlest tastemaker in Southern California, Kim and Khloé wonder why Kris is knee deep in Kylie’s business affairs and never bothers to check in on theirs.  Kris explains that she’s still helping to get Kylie off the ground, which sounds like B.S. to Kim and Khloé since Kylie’s business has been running for nearly two years and she’s made billions. They suppose the real reason is that Kylie makes her the most money, therefore she’s the current favorite and deserves the most attention. Kris does think that Kylie’s general niceness and desire to be around her mother makes her an obvious favorite — and the success doesn’t hurt. Especially since Kylie makes a point to buy Kris fun things to let her know she’s thinking about her. This shocks Kim and Khloé, who got Kris the ultimate fun thing, a surprise 60th birthday party in 2015. And on top of it all: Kendall and Kylie had no thoughts about her 60th birthday at all. Kim and Khloé argue that memories are better than physical gifts. Kris is beyond annoyed, and jokes that these two are now tied for her least favorite. This scene was filmed on August 16, 2017.  Scene 5:  Vying for the top spot in her mother’s life, Khloé shows up to Kris’s to reorganize her kitchen. According to Khloé and Kris’s assistant, Jenna, Kris has always envied Khloé’s kitchen and her “Khlo-C-D” (still very problematic) organizational skills. Today, Khloé’s bringing her skills all the way to Kris.  In the midst of Khloé’s project, Kris shows up and is thrilled. She’s excited about the organized cookies and teas, and she can’t believe her luck. Interrupting their love fest, Kim arrives carrying Kris’s favorite basket-weave cake from Hansen’s bakery. Kris can’t believe that her other daughter would be so kind as to drop off a cake just because. She’s overwhelmed with gratitude. She’s also overwhelmed with an idea to get more treats from her kids … so she casually throws in that this is all the cherry on top of her day of massages with Kylie. Like Scene 3, this scene was filmed on August 16, 2017. Which makes a busy day for our Kardashian and Jenner women!  Scene 8:  Still eager to win over all of her mom’s affection, Khloé rents out the entire Saks Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hill	1
"Port officials are lambasting the family of a young girl for ""reckless behaviour"" after she was dragged into the water by a sea lion off a dock at Steveston in Richmond, B.C.  Video not playing? Click here to watch.  Robert Kiesman, chair of the Steveston Harbour Authority, said there are several signs posted at the popular tourist destination warning people not to feed the sea mammals that frequent the area.  ""You wouldn't go up to a grizzly bear in the bush and hand him a ham sandwich, so you shouldn't be handing a thousand-pound wild mammal in the water slices of bread,"" Kiesman said.  ""And you certainly shouldn't be letting your little girl sit on the edge of the dock with her dress hanging down after the sea lion has already snapped at her once. Just totally reckless behaviour.""  Kiesman said that there are similar issues with people feeding marine mammals throughout B.C., including Prince Rupert, Comox and Victoria.  Robert Kiesman, chair of the Steveston Harbour Authority, says the authority has taken several steps to prevent people from feeding marine mammals like sea lions. (Lauren McCullough/CBC)  A Richmond resident captured dramatic video on Saturday showing the sea lion grabbing the young girl by the dress and dragging her into the water off the dock.  The harbour authority has posted more signs along the dock where the girl was attacked Saturday, Kiesman said, in addition to staff who regularly patrol the area throughout the day to deliver verbal warnings.  According to Canada's Marine Mammal Regulations, ""no person shall disturb a marine mammal except when fishing.""  The signs at the Steveston docks say the maximum penalty for ""disturbing"" a marine mammal is $100,000.

""We've now seen an example of why it's illegal to do this and why it's dangerous and frankly stupid to do this.""  The signs also warn that sea lion bites ""can cause very serious infections that may lead to amputation of a limb or even death.""  Danielle Hyson, a senior marine mammal trainer at the Vancouver Aquarium, says if the girl has a puncture or broken skin from the incident, her family should call the aquarium.  That's because bacteria in sea lions' mouths can cause a specific infection, which Hyson said would need specific treatment. She said the aquarium could provide advice to a doctor about treatment.  Michael Fujiwara's video showing a young girl being dragged into the ocean in Richmond by a sea lion has been viewed millions of times online. (Lauren McCullough/CBC)  SFU student Michael Fujiwara captured the video. He said he was on the dock when he saw the large, male sea lion approach, so he started filming it as a crowd gathered around the animal.  He said a family began feeding it bread crumbs while the young girl got close to the edge of the dock.  'Pretty shaken up'  Fujiwara said it appeared that no one was injured in the incident, but the girl and those with her left immediately after getting her back on the dock.  He told CBC News on Saturday that the family was ""pretty shaken up"" and appeared to be in shock.

CHRIS BROWN HAS responded to controversial photos of him currently circulating with his hands around a woman’s neck.  Whoops! We couldn't find this Tweet  Soon after the pictures spread, some followers of the Grammy winner were left asking some questions and requesting more context into the pics and whether the photographs had anything to do with the fact that he’s previously been charged with battery.  Nah. He was just playin’! Don’t worry about it. Honestly.  On Instagram, he wrote:”THANKS for all the publicity today.

I'm never scared of flying - and as soon as there was any turbulence I was like 'oh my God', because there's more than my life I have to care about now.  “It made me feel a bit more nervous.

She's embroiled in Donald Trump Jr.'s divorce drama after their alleged affair in 2012 was exposed.  But Aubrey O'Day is certainly keeping herself busy as she delights her fans on Instagram sharing numerous sexy snaps, including one of her raunchiest yet on Sunday.  In the latest photo the 34-year-old buxom blonde beauty is seen wearing skimpy black lingerie with lacing on the back as she sits cross-legged on her bed.  Scroll down for videos  Peachy! Aubrey O'Day is seen in a sexy lingerie snap as she shared saucy Instagram snaps amid the Donald Trump Jr. drama  'it's sunday. mongolian beef, side of pineapple fried rice.' she captioned the image with a takeout bag seen on the table in front of her.  In another image she shared the day before Aubrey this time faces the camera as she wears an off the shoulder crocheted bikini.  'i always gotta mean hand.' she captioned the post which shows her holding Uno cards.  Meanwhile, on Monday was spotted taking part in a glamorous outdoor photoshoot.  The former member of Danity Kane wore a plunging blue jumpsuit giving a generous glimpse of her cleavage.  The pictures come as it emerged that the alleged brief affair between Aubrey and Donald Trump Jr was more than just a fling.  The 34-year-old singer shared numerous sexy snaps to her Instagram after making headlines that she was allegedly planning a family with Trump Jr.  Blonde bombshell: Aubrey posed for a sultry photoshoot on Monday in Los Angeles as she showed off plenty of cleavage in a blue jumpsuit  US Weekly reports that the two were trying to start a family back in 2012 during their five-month relationship.  'Don told Aubrey he wanted to have a baby with her,' an insider told the magazine.  'They were trying for one.'  At the time of the affair Don Jr had three children and his wife Vanessa was pregnant with her fourth.  O'Day actually wrote on Twitter that she was pregnant shortly after she and Don Jr reportedly split, saying: 'I've been nervous to tell u this tweets, its been 3 1/2 months n hiding..But, I'm PREGNANT! Hope my baby is fearless!'  Purple pup: The singer posed with her dog Ginger too as she modeled a flowing maxi dress  Chilling: The former Danity Kane member sprawled out on a patch of grass for more snaps  She even included an image of a positive pregnancy test as well, though she later revealed it was all a joke.  The magazine also reveals that the relationship between the pair carried on even after the affair was over.  'He'd call Aubrey and leave long voicemails telling her he still loved her over and over,' said the source.  'He'd cry and say he was nervous his wife would take the kids away.'  The article also points out the comments that O'Day made on a 2012 podcast about her romance on the set of Celebrity Apprentice with a mystery man.  'We did a little eye-f***ing thing,' said O'Day of their early flirting, which all culminated with a steamy tryst during the taping of the show's finale.  'I was walking through the hallways and got pulled into this bathroom,' said O'Day.  Split: At the time of the affair, Don Jr and his wife Vanessa had three children and she was pregnant with her fourth (Don Jr and Vanessa with Donnie III and Kai in October 2012)  'He threw me up against the wall and looked at me for, like, two seconds, and then we started making out like crazy.'  O'Day on the other hand made the decision to transform herself from a Marilyn into a Jackie after the split.  In red carpet footage from the launch party of Assassin's Creed III in October 2012, O'Day explained her new look after showing up in an understated gown that was floor-length and revealed no cleavage.  'I'm trying to dress like a politician's wife,' said O'Day.  In addition to replacing her skin-tight mini dresses with more understated attire, O'Day also toned down her hair by going from an electric crimson to a more subtle shade of chestnut blonde.

Jamie Lee Curtis, who played Eliza Dushku’s mother on 1994’s “True Lies,” spoke out in an op-ed about Dushku’s allegation that the film’s stunt coordinator, Joel Kramer, sexually molested her when she was just 12 years old.  In the op-ed for the Huffington Post, published on Sunday, Curtis revealed that Dushku told her about the alleged incident years ago. “I was shocked and saddened then and still am today.”  “Eliza’s story has now awakened us from our denial slumber to a new, horrific reality,” she wrote. “The abuse of children.”  Curtis pointed to the complexities of working with child actors on set, and recalled when, while she was shooting 1991’s “My Girl” with a young Macaulay Culkin and Anna Chlumsky, she implemented a “swear jar” on set.  “It is a complicated relationship working with children as they are being asked to do adult work with you in an adult field, surrounded by hundreds of adults who want them to perform for them, and yet are still inherently children,” Curtis said. “I have wrestled with my role as a mentor, colleague, surrogate, and friend, and each relationship is individual and unique. Are we really friends? Are we work mates? Children are not mature enough to recognize that subtle difference.”  But another disturbing aspect, Curtis wrote, revolved around the fact that the alleged assault was carried out by a stunt coordinator — the person on set who’s responsible for the actors’ safety. “I was suspended under a helicopter by a wire, holding onto the hand of the man who is now being accused of abuse,” she wrote.  Popular on Variety  “All of us must take some responsibility that the loose and relaxed camaraderie that we share with our young performers has carried with it a misguided assumption that they are adults in an adult world, capable of making adult choices,” she went on.  Curtis is only the latest involved with the production of “True Lies” to speak out on Dushku’s allegation, which Kramer has denied. Director James Cameron, at a Television Critics Association panel on Saturday, commended Dushku’s “brave” decision to go public with the “heartbreaking” story.  “Had I known about it, there would have been no mercy,” Cameron said. “I have three daughters. There’d really be no mercy now.”  Kramer has since been dropped by his agency, World Production Agency.  “Such behavior is unacceptable and entirely at odds with the the standards of conduct we demand of ourselves,” WPA president Richard Caleel said in a statement.

"David Beckham turned 43 Wednesday and while most of his family took him out for a birthday lunch, his eldest son, Brooklyn, was missing.  The former Manchester United player was in a restaurant with his wife, Victoria, and their three youngest kids, Cruz, Romeo, and Harper Seven to mark the occasion.  But the family had a surprise in store, as Brooklyn suddenly walked through the door.  ""What are you doing here!?"" the former Real Madrid star exclaimed to his son as he teared up.  The two embraced as if they hadn’t seen each other in ages.  Victoria Beckham posted the emotional video on Instagram.  She also posted a shot of the former A.C.

LAPD ends investigation into claims by Corey Feldman  The Los Angeles Police Department says it is no longer investigating a sexual assault report filed by actor Corey Feldman.  The LAPD said in a statement Thursday that the events were so long ago that the statute of limitations has expired on Feldman's allegations and detectives have no further avenues to pursue.  The 46-year-old appeared on The Dr. Oz Show last week to say he was sexually assaulted as a child actor and witnessed sexual abuse of other young performers.  Feldman said in a lengthy online post Wednesday that he is grateful to the women who came forward with sexual harassment allegations against Harvey Weinstein because the story has resurrected interest in Feldman's own reports of abuse.  A spokeswoman for Feldman did not immediately respond to a request seeking further comment.	1

"Blac Chyna was involved in a potentially scary car accident on June 24 in Studio City, California.  MediaPunch/REX/Shutterstock  The incident occurred around 2:30 AM that morning, and resulted in the star being checked out by paramedics, according to TMZ.  The individual who rear-ended Blac Chyna's white Rolls-Royce was later detained for a possible DUI, though there's no news if they were confirmed to be driving under the influence.  The outlet reported that immediately after the car accident Blac Chyna was placed in an ambulance and cared for by paramedics for around 45 minutes, before eventually getting the all clear.  Once paramedics determined she was fine, another car then came to pick her up. There's no word on who was driving that vehicle.  Blac Chyna has remained quiet on social media since the incident occurred.  It's not the reality star's first time being involved in car drama. Back in 2015 she allowed a friend, another reality star named Paige Addison from the show ""Boss Nails,"" to drive her white BMW, and Paige subsequently got involved in a pretty serious accident and fled the scene.  At the time rumors swirled that Blac Chyna actually was behind the wheel, as witnesses claimed two African-American women in mini skirts ran from the BMW after smashing it into an Audi SUV. Chyna was eventually able to clear her name once Paige admitted she had been the one driving at the time of the accident."	1
Photo: Vulture and Photos by Logo  It was Labor Day weekend, 2008, and RuPaul had escaped the heat in a friend’s Hollywood Hills pool, taking in the expansive views of Los Angeles before him. Production on the first season of RuPaul’s Drag Race would kick off the next day, and in his usual introspective way, the drag superstar was thinking about the future. “I remember being in that water on such a hot day thinking, from this moment on, my life will be very different,” he recalled. “And it absolutely has been since that day.”  RuPaul, who became the world’s biggest drag star in the ’90s with the release of his single, “Supermodel (You Better Work),” had been away from the limelight for about a decade when Logo picked up his show. But he sensed his third act might be his biggest. President Obama was about to be elected, and a new social and cultural order was in the air, the kind that made it possible to imagine drag thriving beyond underground culture. “I knew the show’s mission statement was to celebrate the art of drag,” RuPaul said, explaining his early optimism about the show’s appeal last month, four days before production on the show’s tenth season began in Los Angeles. “And I knew that drag has more significant meaning and power than just what it seems like on the surface — it speaks to the duality of our lives as humans on this planet.”  As it has turned out, he wasn’t fantasizing. Since Drag Race premiered in 2009, 11 seasons have aired, including two All-Star editions (a third was just picked up). The competition show with a car-race motif spawned three spinoffs, UnTucked, RuPaul’s Drag U, and RuPaul’s Drag Race: Ruvealed, and led to the creation of RuPaul’s DragCon, which has catapulted many of the show’s 113 contestants to international stardom. Last season, Drag Race made the switch to Logo’s sister network VH1, where its ratings doubled and popularity soared higher, jump-started by a Lady Gaga appearance in the premiere that clocked nearly 1 million viewers. In May, Saturday Night Live spoofed the cultural juggernaut during its most popular season in years, with a skit featuring Chris Pine and four other cast members as straight car mechanics who love Drag Race and engage in a lip-sync battle. Then came the kind of acceptance that RuPaul never anticipated, or even particularly desired: In July of this year, the series was nominated for a whopping eight Emmys, including outstanding reality competition. RuPaul also was nominated again for his work as host (he won the trophy last year), a job with several roles: tough taskmaster, therapist, runway slayer, judge.  But long before it gained mainstream acknowledgment, Drag Race had a devoted audience around the world, who knew there was something unusually real here from the start. “I think about the young people out there in Saudi Arabia and Asia and South America and Wyoming, who have watched the show and have found refuge here with our girls and our vernacular and our outlook on life,” RuPaul said, reflecting on the show’s contributions. “I feel that the legacy of our show, Drag Race, is in those young people, and they will carry that legacy with them for the rest of their lives.”  The road to Drag Race was paved 32 years ago at a music seminar in Manhattan, when 24-year-old RuPaul met Randy Barbato and Fenton Bailey, the founders of World of Wonder Productions, who would become his managers and best friends. At the time, Barbato and Bailey were in a band called the Fabulous Pop Tarts and primarily managed music; RuPaul, meanwhile, was trying to sell his first record. “We came from the same background,” RuPaul recalled. “We were all devotees of the church of Warhol. I had grown up reading Interview magazine and thinking my path was to move to New York, become a Warhol superstar, create a persona, and move to Hollywood. When Randy looked at me that day, I could see that he saw what I saw.” Barbato says he recognized RuPaul’s star quality immediately. “It’s the same t	1

"  Carrie Fisher will forever have a place in Disney history.  The late Star Wars actress was honored at D23 in Anaheim, California, on Friday, with the highest of Walt Disney honors: the Disney Legend Award.    RELATED: Carrie Fisher Earns Posthumous Emmy Nomination for ‘Catastrophe’  Fisher's 24-year-old daughter, Billie Lourd, penned a touching acceptance speech on her behalf. The actress was unable to attend the event due to scheduling conflicts, but the letter was read by Disney chairman Bob Iger.  ""As far back as I can remember, my mom and I have been Disney fanatics,"" Iger said as he read Lourd's words aloud. ""I was so obsessed with Ariel that I wanted to change my name. We went to Disneyland so much that I now realize she might have even loved it more than I did.""  ""Becoming part of the Disney family was truly an amazing moment for her. She secretly always wanted to be a Disney princess, so getting to be a Disney princess and a Disney legend would have been her ultimate dream,"" the speech continued. ""I wish I could be there to accept this award on her behalf, but unfortunately, I am currently working on American Horror Story. I am beyond grateful to Mr. Iger and everyone at Disney for this incredible honor. Thank you again, and may the force be with you always.""

"Chrissy Teigen and John Legend 's daughter and first child Luna is only two years old, but she's already a TV star. Today, the trailer was release for the upcoming season of Lip Sync Battle and Luna's cameo in it is obviously adorable.  The fifth season of the show — yes, there really have been that many installments — premieres January 17, 2019, and, when it does, Luna Simone Stephens is going to steal the show. The toddler doesn't lip sync in the next season of the series, but she does cheer on Big Bird and Elmo while they do. All the while Luna sits on her dad's shoulders and lap, as her mom is on host duty, dancing to The Black Eyed Peas' 2010 hit ""I Gotta Feeling."" ""We loooooove Big Bird,"" Legend says.  Of course, little else is given away by the trailer. But it does present a wide spectrum of guests in the fifth season of Lip Sync Battle . The guest list is stacked, too. Everyone from Mariah Carey and Serena Williams (doing Beyoncé, of course ) to Darren Criss, Jason Schwartzman, Nico Tortorella, Molly Bernard, Jermaine Dupri, Boris Kodjoe, Pitbull, Vanessa Morgan, Andy Grammer, Andy Roddick, Brooklyn Decker, and Lele Pons make appearances.  Loading View on Instagram  Williams isn't the only one who takes on Beyoncé in the next season; the Fab Five of Queer Eye also do their best Bey impressions. They dressed for the part, too, in the pop star's Coachella headlining set uniform of cutoff jean shorts and a cropped yellow letterman sweatshirt. There's even more Bey cosplay as Karamo Brown wears her costume from the music video for ""Telephone"" as Jonathan Van Ness dons Lady Gaga's attire from the same clip. ""I feel like Beyoncé, are you kidding me?,"" Brown says.  Teigen recently talked about how she and cohost LL Cool J are able to draw so many big names to the show and, apparently, it couldn't be easier. “Honestly, I don’t have to recruit that many people,” she told Billboard earlier this year as the fourth season premiered. “I get people coming up to me saying that they want to be on the show. And that’s always fun to see at, like, the Met Ball.” Few guests, though, if any, look like they're having as much fun as her daughter, Luna."	1

While Dane will always be a beloved member of The Office cast, he appeared other hit shows throughout his career, including The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air, Boy Meets World, Roc, Friends, Sister, Sister, Hart of Dixie, and more.

In the end, a piece of dental floss saved the day.  Rachel Brosnahan’s otherwise perfect night at the Emmy Awards — which included not only a trophy for best actress in a comedy for Amazon’s “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” but also a win for comedy series, among others — had one tiny flaw. There was the little matter of the diamond ring she couldn’t get off her hand.  Hours earlier, in her rush to get dressed, she tried on the “beautiful, beautiful” ring. But then she wanted to switch it to another finger — and it wouldn’t budge. “And then you know when you start pulling on something, it just gets swollen,” she recounts the next morning over a late breakfast in her hotel room in West Hollywood. “So I was on the red carpet minorly panicking about this ring that was very stuck on my finger.”  It wasn’t until she got home in the wee hours that she was able to do a bit of research on YouTube, and learned about the dental floss and olive oil trick. “It’s all the rage,” she says, joking. After a little threading and a lot of slathering, the offending bauble finally slid off her finger. “So much for a perfect night,” she adds with a laugh.  The awards show had barely begun when it was clear the momentum was all in “Maisel’s” favor. First, Alex Borstein (who plays comedy club manager Susie Myerson) won for best supporting actress; then the show’s creator and executive producer, Amy Sherman-Palladino, made history as the first woman to win for both writing and directing in the same year. The next thing Brosnahan knew, Angela Bassett was announcing her name (if butchering it a bit). “I was completely overwhelmed,” says Brosnahan.  She didn’t prepare a speech, she says, but after what she laughingly recalls as the “Oprah debacle” at the Golden Globes — she’d interrupted herself mid-acceptance with a shout-out to Oprah Winfrey — she cobbled together in her head a list of people to thank. But what she really wanted to do was speak to the moment.  “One of the things I love the most about this show … [is] it’s about a woman who is finding her voice anew,” she said from the stage. “It’s something that’s happening all over the country right now. One of the most important ways that we can find and use our voices is to vote. So if you haven’t already registered, do it on your cell phone right now. Vote, show up and bring a friend to the polls.”  Reflecting on the call to action the next morning, she dismisses any suggestion that it was politically motivated. “It didn’t feel political to me,” she says. “It’s our duty as citizens to have a say.”  And while she recognizes that strident speeches from celebrities at awards shows can feel “self-indulgent and vain,” she wasn’t going to miss the opportunity to take advantage of the spotlight to make a point. “We have a huge election coming up, and it’s more important than ever that we exercise our right to vote,” she says. “It’s hard, hard won.”  Brosnahan says she hasn’t decided where she’ll keep her trophy. “The Golden Globe is on the toilet, but the shelf is not big enough for them both.”  Eric Jamison/Invision/AP/REX/Shu  “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” proved marvelous indeed — the comedy, which will debut its second season later this year, would go on to nearly dominate the half-hour categories — winning five prizes that night and eight trophies overall out of 14 nominations. The Academy clearly fell in love with the tale of Midge Maisel, a 1950s New York City housewife whose fairy-tale life gets upended when her husband walks out, leading her to discover a talent for stand-up comedy.  The morning after the Emmy sweep, bleary-eyed after a late-night run to In-N-Out Burger after hitting the party circuit, Brosnahan is slightly dazed. (“I’m bad at parties,” she says apologetically. “Too much mingling and small talk, which has never been my strong suit.”) Despite the trophy sitting nearby on the bed, the win hasn’t quite sunk in.  “I’ll never recover from having my name spoken in the same sentence as the oth	1

He, like, moves [around]!'  The Golden Globe nominee also revealed that since being pregnant, she no longer craves chicken, coffee, or wine.

As the engagement rumors continue to swirl, Cameron Diaz is not shy about showing off her ring finger.  On Monday, the 42-year-old Annie star was yet again seen sporting a diamond band on her left hand while out and about in West Hollywood, California.  The blonde beauty strategically showed off her sparkly accessory as she covered her mouth during the outing.  Scroll down for video  Are the rumours true? Cameron Diaz was seen showing off her rumored engagement ring on her left hand while out and about in West Hollywood on Monday  She was casually dressed in a forest green military jacket over a white blouse.  Cameron styled her outfit a pair of denim skinny jeans with brown boots as she accessorized her look with a black shoulder bag.  The Sex Tape actress appeared to be make-up free and pulled back her blonde locks in a ponytail.  Something to show off: The blonde beauty's sparkly accessory was clear for all to see during the outing  Casual Cameron: The 42-year-old was casually dressed in a forest green military jacket over a white blouse, which she accessorized with Ghurka's $695 Match handbag  Although she has stayed mum on the engagement rumours, Cameron shared some love advice in the latest issue of Cosmopolitan magazine.  'If you get into a relationship where you want something the guy doesn't want, it's never gonna work,' the cover girl said. 'Timing is everything.  'You're never going to get him to be in that place. No matter how old you are, finding the guy who's in the same place as you are and wants to show up is the only way a relationship works, period.'  Thirsty work: Cameron was seen sipping on an iced coffee during her outing  Buying something for the 'bride'? Meanwhile her rumoured fiance Benji Madden was seen that day heading to Barney's to do some shopping  Cameron and rocker boyfriend Benji Madden are reportedly engaged after a whirlwind seven-month romance.  More details about their relationship have been revealed, including how she knew that The Madden Brothers singer was 'the one' thanks to his 'chivalrous ways,' with insiders telling UsWeekly that the musician 'swept her off her feet.'  And the couple certainly aren't wasting any time as the actress and her 35-year-old beau are apparently hoping to tie the knot in early 2015.  Not wasting time: Cameron and Benji, pictured in September, are reportedly planning a wedding in early 2015  A source said: 'Cameron hasn't been this happy in a long time.  'She found someone who knew how lucky he was to have her. The other guys treated her badly, but Benji would do anything for her. She's madly in love.'  Although Cameron had already met Good Charlotte rocker Benji years before, it was her good friend Nicole Richie - who is married to Benji's twin brother Joel - who set them up together.  An insider revealed that the pair bonded over music and had great conversations, saying, 'Cameron has great taste in music.'  Lovebirds: The couple are reportedly engaged after a whirlwind seven-month romance  Within a month the couple took their relationship public and after just six weeks, Benji traveled to Florida to meet the Other Woman actress's family.  And luckily the star's mother, Billie, approved, with a Cameron source saying, 'Billie absolutely loved Benji. She has been gushing about the relationship, saying she hopes Cameron settles down with him.'  By the end of summer the pair were practically living together in Cameron's $9.5 million Beverly Hills home.  Sparkler: The actress wore what looked like an engagement ring on her left hand for a taping of The Graham Norton Show on Tuesday  Cameron, who has long been skeptical about marriage, was reportedly warmed to the idea by Benji who told her it how important it was to him.  An UsWeekly source said: 'He is more traditional than her. She really doesn't care about getting married but wants babies. He wants to get engaged and married first.'  Nicole Richie recently revealed she takes full 'responsibility' for Cameron a	1

"Sam Smith is done with hiding. In a new interview with The Sunday Times, the 25-year-old singer opened up about embracing his sexuality and gender identity.  ""I don't know what the title would be, but I feel just as much woman as I am man,"" he explained, talking about his love for dressing in heels (“I love a heel. I’ve got loads of heels at home.”).  “There was one moment in my life where I didn't own a piece of male clothing, really. I would wear full make-up every day in school, eyelashes, leggings with Dr. Martens and huge fur coats, for 2.5 years,” he said.  When asked if he considers himself a cisgender male (meaning he associates with the sex he was assigned at birth), he showed two Venus symbols on his fingers.

Smith also opened up about coming out as gay, saying, “Looking back on it, it was the fear of saying the wrong thing and offending… And I was 19 when I started writing the first album. I’d just moved to London from a village — I was literally the only gay in the village. I didn’t know what I wanted to say.""

"The women of Marvel's newest film Black Panther already have the world talking about their powerful looks on the red carpet—and now they've got us melting over how they support each other. Lupita Nyong'o and Danai Gurira, who play Nakia and Okoye, sat down for an interview with E! News to talk about the movie and then magnificently derailed the conversation to fangirl out over each other.  When Gurira was asked about how her power in the film comes so naturally to her, she humbly hesitated and looked to Nyong'o for some backup with answering. Nyong'o took the opportunity to explain just how talented her friend and co-star is.  ""Danai is fierce, but Danai is also a very skilled actor, and she is able to put her fierceness into the work she does,"" she explained. Nyong'o went on to describe how Gurira meticulously studies her roles to make them so believable: ""Danai breathes fire into her character,"" Nyong'o said. ""Really, straight up, like a dragon.""  Gurira laughed and said, ""I always wanted to be a dragon.""  Gurira went on to describe just how amazed she is by Nyong'o's talents both on screen and on stage after working together on Eclipsed, a play she wrote and brought to Broadway.  ""There's a smoothness to how she just delivers a character,"" Gurira said. ""I was just watching her going, Oh my god... I'm just like, 'What the hell is this woman? What is she?'""  The pair went on to explain that their love is very real.  ""It is a girl crush,"" Nyong'o said.  ""Unfortunately, we're straight, but..."" Gurira explained. ""We've discussed this.""  ""Worst comes to worse, you know..."" Nyong'o teased.  The interviewer asked how many years they'd wait before agreeing to spend their lives together.  ""Ten? Ten,"" Nyong'o said. Gurira agreed.

It's been just over a year since professional football player Michael Strahan suddenly left his co-host Kelly Ripa to host Good Morning America, leaving the show called, simply, Live! With Kelly.  Today, Ripa, who has been hosting the syndicated show since 2001 when she joined original host Regis Philbin, announced her new co-host: veteran host Ryan Seacrest.  The television producer responsible for the Kardashian franchises started out on ESPN before moving to various game shows and smaller reality programs. He got his big break in 2002 as the host of American Idol, which made him a household name. In 2005 he began hosting New Years Rocking Eve, and in 2006 he started hosting E! News. He has previously tried his hand at daytime TV: On-Air with Ryan Seacrest, a syndicated talkshow, lasted less than a year in 2004.  Now, Seacrest, who earned $55 million last year, hosts a syndicated radio show for Los Angeles’ KIIS-FM, in addition to having an overall production (and occasional hosting) deal with NBC Universal. His new hosting gig on an ABC shouldn't affect any of his production contracts (his Ryan Seacrest Productions produces shows for Fox, CBS and NBC), though we likely won't be seeing him on-air at the Peacock at the next Olympics.  “Ryan is a quintessential broadcaster and at the top of his game,” said Ripa in a statement. “I am thrilled to start my mornings with him every day, and we are so fortunate at ‘Live’ to have him join the family. Ryan is a close friend and his star shines as brightly off camera as it does on. His tremendous success is only matched by his impeccable reputation. Plainly said, everyone loves him, and so will our daily viewers.”  Rather than immediately replace Strahan—who left abruptly without ABC giving Ripa or the show's executive producer much notice—a series of guest hosts (including Seacrest) took turns in the hot seat next to Ripa.  The rotating hosts did well for ratings. The show, which is distributed by ABC's parent company Disney, maintained its spot as the number two syndicated daytime talk show behind Dr. Phil. In most markets, the show airs during the 9 a.m. hour and beats the third hour of Today. The show brings in an estimated $85 to $90 million for ABC thanks to ad revenue and license fees.  While Ripa may have been upset about the manner in which ABC handled Strahan's departure—in an on-air statement at the time, she condemned the network for not keeping her in the loop about its plans—she likely ended up with the long end of the stick, at least where money is concerned.  Prior to Strahan's departure, Forbes estimates that Ripa was making about $15 million per year from the show. (She made a total $17 million last year thanks to padding her income with endorsement deals). But after she was left in the dark about Strahan's departure and had to host the show alone for a year, she likely ended up with quite a bit of negotiating power when it came to her next contract, which will be in effect starting during 2017-2018 season. On top of that, without having to pay Strahan, the show likely had extra cash in its budget to pay her a hefty bonus for this past season.  The well-known Seacrest will cost the show a pretty penny—he's even willing to relocate from Los Angeles to New York for the gig—but it will likely prove worth it. With a built-in fan base, Seacrest's visibility will increase that of the show, and with his hand in so many other pots—from music to television to clothing—he has existing relationships with many potential guests.  “One of the secrets to Live’s decades of success in daytime is the relatability of our hosts and their ability to deeply connect with the audience,” said Janice Marinelli, president of Disney/ABC Home Entertainment and TV Distribution, in a statement. “Ryan has a charm and charisma that resonate with his devoted TV and radio audiences, and together, he and the remarkable Kelly Ripa will take Live to a whole new level.”  For the latest on the entertainment	1
"Britney Spears is the princess of pop—and don't you forget it.  At Saturday's performance of her ""Piece of Me"" residency at Planet Hollywood in Las Vegas, Brit clapped back at lip-syncing accusations and lived up to the title of Godney with a stripped-down performance of Bonnie Raitt's 1991 hit ""Something to Talk About."" As seen in videos posted by concertgoers, Spears, wearing black lingerie, fishnet tights, thigh-high boots, and long blond pigtails (yasss), paused her high-energy show to address the audience. ""So, I've been doing a lot of thinking lately, right?"" she said. ""This morning I woke up and I was like, I looked at the news and there's a lot of things going on in the world and stuff, but basically I looked and I was like, you know what, the press and the media…my whole life, you know, it's really crazy—one minute they tear you down and they're really horrible, and the next minute you're on top of the world, you know?""  The pop star and Instagram icon continued, ""I never really spoke about it, you know, and I'm a Southern girl. I'm from Louisiana. I'm from the South and I like to keep it real, so I want to just make sure I keep having you motherf*ckers something to talk about, okay?"" The 35-year-old then launched into her soulful cover of the sassy track, confidently strutting across the stage and proving once and for all that the vocal tracks she uses in her concerts are purely for backup purposes, as she's repeatedly stated.  Most recently, prior to a July performance in Tel Aviv, Spears responded to lip-syncing rumors in an interview with an Israeli TV program, according to Entertainment Weekly . ""A lot of people think that I don't sing live,"" she said. ""I usually, because I'm dancing so much, I do have a little bit of playback, but there's a mixture of my voice and the playback. It really pisses me off because I am busting my ass out there and singing at the same time and nobody ever really gives me credit for it, you know?"" And in a 2014 interview with Medium shortly after Spears's über-successful four-year residency began, one of her managers, Adam Leber, backed up the ""...Baby One More Time"" singer's claims. ""To put on the show that she puts on, it's virtually impossible to sing the entire time and do what she does. She's singing on every song, basically, when she has the ability to sing,"" he said. ""There's no way you can dance for 90 minutes straight and sing the entire time.""  Loading View on Instagram  Actresses Priyanka Chopra and Jodie Foster Reinterpret ""Toxic"" by Britney Spears"	1
"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are set to have the wedding of the year this coming spring, but don’t expect their royal affair to be a copy of Prince William and Duchess Kate’s 2011 ceremony. Here’s what we know so far about how the wedding will be different.  On Tuesday, Kensington Palace announced that the wedding will take place in May 2018 at St. George’s Chapel in Windsor Castle. The Queen has approved the venue, and the royal family will pay for the wedding.  The marriage of Prince Harry and Ms. Meghan Markle will take place at St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle in May 2018. pic.twitter.com/lJdtWnbdpB — Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) November 28, 2017  St. George’s Chapel contains the tombs of 10 royals, including Henry VIII and his third wife, Jane Seymour. At least three services take place there every day, and all are open to the public. Windsor Castle, where the Queen lives for part of every year, is located about 20 miles west of London. ""Windsor is a very special place for Prince Harry and he and Ms. Markle have regularly spent time there over the last year and a half,"" Kensington Palace said in a statement. Harry himself was christened there in 1984, so by the rules of the Church of England, he can be married there.  St. George’s Chapel at Windsor Castle.

Getty Images  Though William and Kate were married in Westminster Abbey in 2011 and Prince Charles and Princess Diana were married at St. Paul’s Cathedral in 1981, Harry's wedding won’t be the first time a recent royal has married at St. George’s. According to NBC News, Harry’s uncle, Prince Edward, married Sophie Rhys-Jones there in 1999, and his cousin, Peter Phillips, married Autumn Kelly at the chapel in 2008. Prince Charles and Camilla Parker-Bowles had a televised religious blessing there after they had a civil wedding ceremony nearby in 2005.  The space is much smaller than Westminster Abbey, holding around 800 people compared to the Abbey's whopping 2,000, The Guardian reports. Harry and Meghan plan on making the ceremony reflect their personalities and they're determining a way to involve the public in some way, their spokesman revealed. Either way, the tone seems like it will be much different from William and Kate’s pomp and circumstance.  “It will be a moment of fun and joy that will reflect the character of the bride and groom,” their spokesman told journalists. “The couple of course want the day to be a special, celebratory moment for their friends and family. They also want the day to be shaped so as to allow members of the public to feel part of the celebrations too and are currently working through ideas for how this might be achieved.”"	1

"Have you made the trip to Magnolia Market, Chip and Joanna Gaines's store in Waco, Texas, yet? Fans of HGTV's Fixer Upper know that the couple undertook their biggest rehab project ever when they acquired a sprawling downtown Waco property that includes two huge grain silos and a 20,000-square-foot barn. Since its grand opening in 2015, the complex has quickly become more than a store—it's a major destination, where thousands flock every week. Here's what you need to know about visiting the silos.  1. Where is Magnolia Market at the Silos located?  Location was key when Chip and Joanna were looking to expand their store. Joanna was charmed by the rustic look of the silos at 601 Webster Ave—as well as the idea of fixing up a Waco landmark. But it was the property's proximity to the couple's four kids' school that really got her thinking; after all, Chip and Jo have always been adamant about putting family first (they recently ended their HGTV show to focus on their businesses and personal lives).  Jessica Mattern  2. When is Magnolia Market at the Silos open?  Magnolia Market's regular business hours are 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. Monday through Saturday. The market—as well as the Gaineses' restaurant, Magnolia Table—is closed on Sundays.  3. Where can you park at Magnolia Market?  The silos grounds offers free parking (enter on 8th street), including handicap spaces on 6th street. If the lot's full, you can always park farther away (but please, avoid railroad tracks and the lots of neighboring businesses) and take the free Silo District Trolley to the market instead.

Pictures can't quite do the new Magnolia Market justice, because it's so large—it covers two-and-a-half acres—so you really have to wander around quite a bit to take in the various parts of the property and appreciate all it has to offer.  5. It's not just a store.  Magnolia Market at the Silos, as it's officially called, replaces Joanna's now-closed smaller Magnolia Market, which was a pretty standard—if very tasteful—retail shop located on Bosque Blvd in Waco. The new Magnolia Market feels like something much more: a place to buy stuff, yes, but also a community center, .  As you walk onto the property from Waco's Webster Ave, you can head up a short set of stairs to your left and start shopping in the main building—or you can choose to bypass the building and just walk around outdoors.  6. What's in the silos?  Outside to your right, there's an irresistible photo op: those iconic grain silos—which you can't actually enter, but which sure look impressive. According to the Magnolia website, the couple has big plans for the structures. Last we heard, Chip was set to open his own store in one silo, but there hasn't been an update on the progress since January. Of course, the couple has been quite busy; they're currently expecting baby number five! (For now, he has ""Chip's Corner,"" a small section in the main showroom with a handful of Chip-endorsed items.)  Jessica Mattern  During both of our visits, people lined up to pose in front of the silos; there was a shiny red vintage truck, with a Christmas tree tied to its roof, parked right where the silos are joined in the middle by a tin roof with the famous Magnolia sign—er, MAgNoLia sign—bolted to it.  7. The grounds are just as fun as the market itself.  Next to the silos: a large green field (with artificial turf) where kids and parents can toss a football, play cornhole, or have a potato sack race. Beyond that: an area with picnic tables and a half-dozen food trucks (more on those in a moment) and a little garden.  8. Don’t forget to visit Magnolia Seed + Supply…  It's no secret that Joanna has a green thumb. Her own garden at the farmhouse is a thing of beauty. Now, you can stock up on tools to channel your inner Jo at the gardening shop.  9. …or Magnolia’s onsite bakery, Silos Baking Co."	1

Joe Jackson was laid to rest in a private funeral yesterday afternoon at Forest Lawn in Glendale, California. But the famous family couldn’t stop feuding long enough to let their patriarch rest in peace!  RadarOnline.com can exclusively reveal that superstar Janet, 52, and her niece Paris, 20, refused to speak and kept far away from each other during the services.  “Paris was almost unnoticeable at the funeral, and chose to stay away from her father’s siblings,” a source told Radar. “She was definitely frosty.”  PHOTOS: Family Feud: Joe Jackson’s Loved Ones Still Reeling From Years Of Abuse  A separate Jackson family insider told Radar that the model is furious with her aunt for not spending Joe’s last days by his side.  “Paris thinks Janet is acting fake,” the insider said. (As Radar has previously reported, Janet and her father had a notoriously tumultuous relationship.)  Radar previously reported that Janet and Paris were fighting over who would cover the costs of the funeral.  PHOTOS: Sad Final Days: Inside Joe Jackson’s Tragic Last Moments  “Paris believes her grandpa is a legend and should be treated as such,” a source told Radar last week.  While Paris and Janet snubbed each other, Joe’s daughter LaToya fought with his grandson Taj, the son of Tito Jackson.  “Taj is very protective of his grandpa, and he feels that it was disrespectful for her to attend,” the insider told Radar. (LaToya accused Joe of sexual abuse in her 1991 memoir.)  As Radar reported, Joe died after a battle with cancer on June 17. He was 89.  The source told Radar Joe was buried outside of the mausoleum where Michael was laid to rest in 2009.  Though celebrities including Jay Z, Wyclef Jean, Tyler Perry and Diana Ross were invited to the funeral, none of the stars attended.  We pay for juicy info! Do you have a story for RadarOnline.com?

Ellen DeGeneres turns 60 on Jan. 26. Plans for her birthday celebration have yet to be revealed, but the world-famous talk show host typically dedicates an entire episode of her show to the special occasion — including gifts for her audience and cameos by iconic celebrity friends.  Ellen’s never been one to keep all the festivities for herself, either. Those fortunate enough to be in the audience for the Ellen DeGeneres’ birthday show in the past have received a Netflix gift cards that covered five years of the subscription service, a $300 Lyft rideshare service gift cards and a three-day, two-night stay at the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess hotel. Keep reading and learn more about this celebrity’s net worth.  Ellen DeGeneres Net Worth: $400 Million  Ellen’s net worth is $400 million, according to CelebrityNetWorth. In 2015, she made $75 million, which earned her the No. 12 spot on Forbes’ list of the highest-paid celebrities in the world. Ellen’s wife — actress Portia de Rossi — has her own $20 million fortune, which brings the celebrity couple’s total net worth to $420 million.  Starting out as a stand-up comedian, Ellen rose to fame as an actress, starring in the TV series “Ellen” from 1994 to 1998 and “The Ellen Show” from 2001 to 2002. Her daytime talk show, “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” debuted on Sept. 8, 2003, and has consistently received high ratings. In 2015, the Ellen show won the Daytime Emmy Award for Outstanding Talk Show Entertainment. According to Variety, Ellen receives an estimated annual salary of $50 million from “The Ellen DeGeneres Show.”  Ellen has hosted the Oscars twice, both in 2007 and in 2014. She made history during the 2014 gig by tweeting a group selfie with a gaggle of famous friends — Meryl Streep, Bradley Cooper, Jennifer Lawrence, Julia Roberts, Brad Pitt and Kevin Spacey — a photo that has received 3.5 million retweets since being posted.  Hollywood continued to treat Ellen well as she was famously voiced for the character Dory in the 2003 Pixar film “Finding Nemo” and “Finding Dory” in 2016. Ellen has also found major success behind the camera with her own production company A Very Good Production.  Ellen DeGeneres Business Ventures  The tech-savvy superstar launched the site Ellentube in 2014, which hosts exclusive video content from her talk show. In 2015, she also partnered with Vessel to debut one or two clips from “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” on the streaming site before they’re available anywhere else.  Ellen has also ventured into the beauty and fashion world. In 2009, she became the face of COVERGIRL and continues to work with the cosmetics company. She also previously served as the spokeswoman for JCPenney and American Express. And her lifestyle brand, ED by Ellen — including clothing, accessories and home decor — launched in 2015.  In late 2017, DeGeneres also debuted a new game show titled “Ellen’s Game of Games” on NBC, expanding the popular games which have been previously featured on her talk show.  Big Tippers: 10 Celebs Who’ve Left Generous Tips  Ellen DeGeneres Real Estate Portfolio  Ellen and wife de Rossi have made a name for themselves as real estate magnates. The couple has a knack for purchasing swanky properties and unloading them to fellow celebrities. For example, they became landlord to musician Nick Jonas in 2015, renting one of their many homes to the 24-year-old.  The couple purchased a mid-century modern Los Angeles mansion in January 2014 for nearly $40 million and promptly sold it to Sean Parker six months later for $55 million. Previously, in May 2012, they sold their 15,000 sq. ft. Beverly Hills compound to Ryan Seacrest for $36.5 million. Ellen and Portia also purchased Brad Pitt’s former Malibu bachelor pad in 2011 for $12 million and sold it to cosmetics entrepreneur Victoria Jackson in 2012 for $13 million.  In March 2006 — prior to her marriage to de Rossi — Ellen sold a home in Hollywood Hills, Calif. to Will Ferrell for $9 million. She also sold former Goo	0
The FCC has decided against taking any action on Stephen Colbert’s May 1 Late Show broadcast, in which he treated President Donald Trump to a series of increasingly Rabelaisian insults, in response to on-air insults Trump had delivered earlier in the day to CBS News-man John Dickerson.  Colbert’s slew of frat-boy remarks culminated in a crack that the only thing Trump’s mouth is good for “is being Vladimir Putin’s [expletive] holster.” The naughty word was bleeped in the broadcast, and Colbert’s mouth was pixelated. But, intrepid journalists, who are paid to ferret out the truth, discovered what was the word, and they printed it – minus the offending syllable, of course.  All hell broke loose.  Related Story Stephen Colbert Wins 2016-17 TV Season In Late-Night, Taking On Donald Trump  Trump called Colbert “no-talent guy.” Colbert’s monologue was plastered by some as inappropriately vulgar, by others as homophobic. The FCC received thousands of complaints. Reporters breathlessly reported Colbert was under FCC investigation, and a good time was had by all.  Today, however, the FCC put an end to the fun, saying in a statement: “Consistent with standard operating procedure, the FCC’s Enforcement Bureau has reviewed the complaints and the material that was the subject of these complaints.”  “The Bureau has concluded that there was nothing actionable under the FCC’s rules.”  In rough numbers, the FCC was saying that programs airing on broadcast TV stations before 10 PM are subject to fine if the commission determines they are “indecent.” Shows that run in late-night, however, have a different threshold: content must be ruled “obscene” for stations to be fined. FCC defines obscene as content that “must appeal to an average person’s prurient interest; depict or describe sexual conduct in a ‘patently offensive’ way; and, taken as a whole, lack serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.”  Here’s the monologue that launched a thousand complaints:	0
Rachel Weisz stands in the doorway of a cafe in downtown New York, adjusting to the gloom from the brightness outside. We are in the East Village, a formerly bohemian part of town long since gentrified, although, as I note to her as she sits down, the park at the end of the street still seems to host a few local eccentrics. “Yes,” she smiles, fishing in her bag for her glasses. “It’s not all bankers.” The 47-year-old lives around the corner and, in spite of her wealth, fame and marriage to Daniel Craig, gives the impression of living a life somewhat in line with the low-maintenance neighbourhood. This morning, Weisz dropped off Henry, her 10-year‑old son, at school, went to yoga, caught up on emails, and tonight she is taking Henry to the theatre. She is trying to get people together on Sunday for a roast dinner.  It’s hard for me to understand how Donald Trump happened. It’s surrealist  I mention all this because Weisz is a serious person and an interesting actor who has almost no tolerance for the indignities of fame. Her own celebrity is bad enough, but my God, to be married to James Bond – the mortifying excess of it! – and her reserve in the face of what she considers lascivious interest has often presented, over the years, as diffidence. There is not much of that in evidence today; she is sunny and sociable, unrecognised by all but the staff at the cafe, and bearing little relation to the creepy terms in which British newspapers have, for 20 years, been describing her (a “starlet”, a “siren” and, of course, an “English rose”). In a floral print dress and sensible shoes, she looks like everyone else in the cafe, which is to say, someone who has only glanced in the mirror before leaving the house.  I realise I am being a killjoy with this, but there is a particularly trouser-rubbing tone to much of the coverage of Weisz that her near contemporaries – Kate Winslet, Kate Beckinsale – don’t suffer to quite the same degree, and that has to do with an idea that her looks are “unusual”. The one startling thing about Weisz’s appearance today is that, without much in the way of cosmetics, she looks easily 10 years younger than she is. At an age when a female movie star’s options are expected to dwindle, Weisz is having the best decade of her career, starting in 2006 with her Oscar for best supporting actor in The Constant Gardener and leading up to Denial, in which she played Deborah Lipstadt, the Holocaust historian who was unsuccessfully sued for libel by David Irving. A few years ago, Weisz bought the rights to Naomi Alderman’s novel Disobedience – the story of a lapsed orthodox Jewish woman returning from her life in New York to her native north London – which is about to go into post-production, and she is soon to appear in My Cousin Rachel, an adaptation of the Daphne du Maurier novel.  My Cousin Rachel is something of a Rorschach test, for viewers as for Weisz herself, who had to decide if her character was primarily a victim or a villain before playing the role. It is the story of a glamorous widow who returns from Italy to Cornwall and transfixes the young heir to her late husband’s estate, whereupon her motives fall into question. The movie tries, successfully, to keep all interpretations open, as does Weisz. “I can’t tell you,” she says as to whether she perceived the character to be a gold digger who conned a young man out of his fortune, or a woman unfairly maligned. “I think it would ruin it. I completely decided, and I’ve only met two people who have seen it other than you, and one of them was adamant and said, ‘Oh, she definitely did it.’ And the other said not.”  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Rachel Weisz with Sam Claflin in her new film, My Cousin Rachel. Photograph: Nicola Dove  It is my hunch that Weisz plays the heroine as innocent; it is more morally interesting that way, turning the character from The Woman In Black into someone more sinned against than sinning, who flushes out the biases in all who would judge	0
"This article is about the racing driver. For his father, see Arie Luyendyk  Arie Luyendyk Jr. ( ; Dutch: [ˈaːri ləjɛnˈdik]; born 18 September 1981) is a Dutch-American auto racing driver and son of two-time Indianapolis 500 winner Arie Luyendyk.

Luyendyk's qualifying speed of 215.039 mph (346.072 km/h) was close to 2 mph (3.2 km/h) slower than the next slowest qualifier at the time. A. J. Foyt hired driver Felipe Giaffone to qualify a third car for him, and Giaffone's 217.645 mph (350.266 km/h) four-lap average bumped Luyendyk from the field.  Luyendyk did qualify for the 2006 Indianapolis 500 in a car owned by his father and backed by cheapcaribbean.com and Blue Star Jets. The team had limited practice time due to a second week engine program. However, his first race in the more powerful cars ended early due to handling issues, with Luyendyk finishing 54 laps out of 200 and ending in 28th place in the field of 33.[citation needed]  In the 2007–08 A1 Grand Prix season, Luyendyk drove for A1 Team Netherlands in the A1 Grand Prix World Cup of Motorsport as the team's ""rookie driver"".

Corinne Olympios is returning to “Bachelor in Paradise” for its upcoming cast reunion following the show temporarily shutting down production on Season 4.  “I am very happy to be appearing on the ‘Bachelor in Paradise’ special,” Olympios said in a statement released to TheWrap on Wednesday.  Her former “Paradise” co-star DeMario Jackson recently said he is also attending the reunion.  Also Read: How Reality TV Producers Prevent a 'Bachelor in Paradise'-Type Mess  Jackson and Olympios were both involved in an incident that led Warner Bros. to announce on June 11 that it was shutting down production due to “allegations of misconduct.”  The ABC dating series resumed production after the studio announced on June 20 that the results of its investigation did “not support any charge of misconduct by a cast member.”  Olympios said in a statement released on June 29 that her team had concluded its investigation into the allegations that led to the shutdown.  Also Read: 'The Bachelorette' Raises Ugly Stereotypes About 'Aggressive' Black Men  She pointed out that producers offered her a chance to return to the action, but she declined. Jackson also said he will not return as a Season 4 contestant.  Jackson told E! News in an interview last month that he performed oral sex on Olympios during filming, and that she was the “aggressor.” He said he was not mad at her, but that he was “mad at the situation.”  “Paradise” Season 4 is set to premiere on ABC later this summer.	1
"Kate Middleton, Britain's Duchess of Cambridge, is one of the best dressed women in the world, crediting with reinvigorating life into the British fashion industry and winning praise for mixing high end Alexander McQueen gowns with jewellery from Zara. Pippa, on the other hand, recently wore this to a wedding in Cork.  Pippa Middleton and her husband James Matthews in Glengarriff last summer  The more private Middleton sister was also thrust into the spotlight when her sister's relationship with Prince William went public in 2005 and in 2008, she began being pictured alongside her sister, as well as on her own. Her undeniable beauty and penchant for socialising meant she was a more accessible Kate and gave us countless iconic looks which sum up the noughties for all of us.  2006  We were first introduced to her walking arm in arm with Kate at Cheltenham in 2006, wearing a suede boot with a kitten heel we could all approve of.

"Alyssa Milano Net Worth and salary: Alyssa Milano is an American actress, producer and singer who has a net worth of $10 million dollars. Alyssa Milano became a household name in the 80's with her starring role on the sitcom, Who's the Boss?. She appeared in several television movies in the 90's, and starred in the television series, Charmed.

She made her big screen debut as Arnold Schwarzenegger's kidnapped daughter in Commando (1985), while also starring in several other high school-themed television movies. Few years after the series was cut, Milano abandoned her good girl image for more sultry one in movies like Embrace of the Vampire (1994) and Poison Ivy II: Lily (1996).

Her accountant reportedly failed to make payments to the IRS which led to millions of dollars in penalties and unpaid taxes.

Meghan Markle and Prince Harry en route to their wedding reception. Photo: WPA Pool/Getty Images  Meghan Markle and Prince Harry were (finally) married in a very royal wedding ceremony on Saturday, which was attended by 600 invited guests, a ton of members of the public, and, oh, just an estimated 1.9 billion people watching worldwide.  Afterward, the newly married Duke and Duchess of Sussex celebrated their nuptials away from the cameras during a private lunch for the invited ceremony guests. Then, there was another private evening reception for 200 close friends and family, hosted by Prince Charles at Frogmore House on the Windsor estate. Thankfully for those of us who (for some reason) were not on the guest list, reports about what went down at the exclusive affairs have emerged.  What Does It Take To Be A Duchess? Inside A Royal Etiquette Class  During the lunch, Prince Harry reportedly gushed about Meghan in a speech.  After the ceremony, guests of the fancy nuptials headed to a lunch reception. There, Prince Harry reported gave an emotional speech, during which he professed his love and admiration for his new wife. According to the Sun, Prince Harry told Meghan (and the room) that they make “great team.” He added that she “navigated everything with such grace,” and then said, “I can’t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.” Oh, we know.  The couple after the wedding ceremony. Photo: Leon Neal/Getty Images  Prince Charles also gave a nice speech.  Prince Charles, who escorted his new daughter-in-law part of the way down the aisle on Saturday, also reportedly gave a nice speech at the afternoon reception. The Mirror notes that Prince Charles spoke of the man his “darling old Harry” had grown into, but he also cracked a joke about changing Prince Harry’s diapers as a kid. One guest told the Daily Mail, “Prince Charles made a really gracious speech, it was amazingly endearing. He’s got a wonderfully dry sense of humor.”  Guests got to swap their heels for slippers.  Pretty Little Liars star Troian Bellisario, who is married to Meghan’s Suits onscreen husband Patrick J. Adams, showed on Instagram that guests at the afternoon reception were given very fancy slippers to change into if their heels were hurting them. How thoughtful.  Troian Bellisario showing the slippers people were given. Photo: sleepnthegardn/Instagram  Elton John Performed.  He apparently sang “Your Song” and “Tiny Dancer,” which is nice, as well as “Circle of Life,” which is from The Lion King.  And there was cake.  The lemon elderflower cake Meghan and Prince Harry selected looked amazing. Baker Claire Ptak shared a pic of the cake on social media.  Then, guests (and also Meghan and Prince Harry) changed before the evening reception.  We’ve already seen (and memorized) pictures of Meghan and Prince Harry in their evening reception attire (for reference, look at the pic above). Meghan swapped her Clare Waight Keller for Givenchy ceremony gown for a minimal Stella McCartney dress for the party, while Prince Harry donned a fancy tuxedo.

Matt Damon addressed the sexual allegations against Harvey Weinstein, saying, “I knew I wouldn’t want him married to anyone close to me.”  Interested in Harvey Weinstein? Add Harvey Weinstein as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Harvey Weinstein news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest  “But that was the extent of what we knew. I mean, and that wasn’t a surprise to anybody. So when you hear Harvey this, Harvey that — I mean, look at the guy. Of course he’s a womanizer,” Damon continued in an interview for ABC News’ “Popcorn With Peter Travers.”  Damon, who stars in the upcoming film “Downsizing,” worked with Weinstein on his Oscar-winning film “Good Will Hunting,” which was produced by Weinstein’s production company Miramax.  In the past year, several women have publicly accused Weinstein of sexual misconduct. Weinstein has acknowledged inappropriate behavior but has denied any allegations of nonconsensual sex.  “Any allegations of nonconsensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances,” his spokesman previously said.  In a wide-ranging discussion with Travers on Tuesday, Damon opened up about Weinstein and others inside and outside the entertainment world who have been publicly accused of sexual misconduct this year.  Read part of Damon’s conversation with Travers below.  Maryellen McGrath/ABC  Peter Travers: We live now in a different age, in a political age. There’s a lot of dissidence that goes on in the world that could affect you as an actor. We’re also in the age of people charged with sexual misconduct. This is everywhere. How do you react to that? Especially you, as the father of four girls.  Matt Damon: I think we’re in this watershed moment. I think it’s great. I think it’s wonderful that women are feeling empowered to tell their stories, and it’s totally necessary … I do believe that there’s a spectrum of behavior, right? And we’re going to have to figure — you know, there’s a difference between, you know, patting someone on the butt and rape or child molestation, right? Both of those behaviors need to be confronted and eradicated without question, but they shouldn’t be conflated, right? You know, we see somebody like Al Franken, right? — I personally would have preferred if they had an Ethics Committee investigation, you know what I mean? It’s like at what point — you know, we’re so energized to kind of get retribution, I think.  And we live in this culture of outrage and injury, and, you know, that we’re going to have to correct enough to kind of go, “Wait a minute. None of us came here perfect.” You know what I mean? … The Louis C.K. thing, I don’t know all the details. I don’t do deep dives on this, but I did see his statement, which kind of, which [was] arresting to me. When he came out and said, “I did this. I did these things. These women are all telling the truth.” And I just remember thinking, “Well, that’s the sign of somebody who — well, we can work with that” … Like, when I’m raising my kids, this constant personal responsibility is as important as anything else they learn before they go off in the world.  And the fear for me is that right now, we’re in this moment where at the moment — and I hope it doesn’t stay this way — the clearer signal to men and to younger people is, deny it. Because if you take responsibility for what you did, your life’s going to get ruined …  I mean, look, as I said, all of that behavior needs to be confronted, but there is a continuum. And on this end of the continuum where you have rape and child molestation or whatever, you know, that’s prison. Right? And that’s what needs to happen. OK? And then we can talk about rehabilitation and everything else. That’s criminal behavior, and it needs to be dealt with that way. The other stuff is just kind of shameful and gross, and I just think … I don’t know Louis C.K.. I’ve never 	1

The pop star got engaged to her significant other Daryl Sabara at the end of last year, and she is keen to tie the knot in a ‘chilled’ ceremony in her own backyard.  LONDON - Meghan Trainor is planning to have a winter wedding.  The 24-year-old pop star got engaged to her significant other Daryl Sabara at the end of last year, and she is keen to tie the knot in a “chilled” ceremony in her own backyard around 12 months after he got down on one knee.  She said: “I was thinking, my backyard’s real pretty. Like, real beautiful. And I just want it be chill and with my family in the backyard so I think I’m going to do that around Christmas time because it’s my favourite.  “My mom is like, ‘Stop telling them.’ It’ll be fine mom. No one knows where I live. Maybe.”  The No Excuses hitmaker admits she and Sabara have adopted a more positive outlook since she shot to fame, and the couple were so pleased to be heading to New York to film the morning news programme.  Speaking on the Today Show on NBC, which co-hosting the programme alongside Hoda Kotb, she added: “I’m so happy.  “We’re saying that a lot more now. Like, ‘Wow, what are we doing here?’ “  Trainor recently said she wants her wedding to be a “casual” affair, and she is keen to put on a barbecue for all her guests.  She said: “I think I’m just gonna be casual. I think I’m just gonna do it in my backyard. I’ve got a great yard and my manager, like, legally can marry people.  “Yeah, I just might have my best friend do it and we might just chill and have like a barbecue. I don’t know!”  The star recently admitted she wanted to “lock” Sabara down into picking a date for their nuptials.  She told BANG Showbiz: “It’s that cheesy line of ‘You know when you know’ and that’s so real because I’ve never had anything like this with any other human, I’ve never not got sick of someone. I’ve been with him literally every day and I’m not sick of him, and I miss him when he’s not in my visual sight, it’s gross.”	1

"American actor  Caleb Casey McGuire Affleck-Boldt (born August 12, 1975) is an American actor and director. He began his career as a child actor, appearing in the PBS television film Lemon Sky (1988) and the miniseries The Kennedys of Massachusetts (1990). He later appeared in three Gus Van Sant films – To Die For (1995), Good Will Hunting (1997), and Gerry (2002) – and in Steven Soderbergh's comedy heist trilogy Ocean's Eleven (2001), Ocean's Twelve (2004), and Ocean's Thirteen (2007). His first leading role was in Steve Buscemi's independent comedy-drama Lonesome Jim (2006).

In 2010, he directed the mockumentary I'm Still Here. He then had a string of successful films in the early 2010s, with Tower Heist, ParaNorman, and Interstellar, and received particular praise for his performance as an outlaw in the indie film Ain't Them Bodies Saints.  In 2016, Affleck starred as the lead in the drama film Manchester by the Sea.

"It's been over two years since Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton first got together, and a source close to the 41-year-old country singer tells ET that they're happier than ever!  The two were recently spotted strolling down the beach in Playa del Carmen, Mexico, and even ran into Shelton's pal, Luke Bryan. Stefani wore a white bikini top that she paired with a black sarong and a tan sweater, while Shelton sported a blue trucker hat that matched his board shorts and button-down shirt.  While they may have been an unexpected pair when they first started dating, Shelton and Stefani have been going strong for some time now.  Backgrid  ""Gwen really loves Blake for who he is and has never once tried to change him or anything about him. She even loves his style!"" the source tells ET. ""She thinks he's such a manly man and is incredibly attracted to that about him.""  When they're not taking romantic walks along the beach, the couple often visit Shelton's house in Oklahoma along with Stefani's three sons with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale, 11-year-old Kingston, 9-year-old Zuma and 3-year-old Apollo. The source notes that the 48-year-old singer ""loves the influence Blake has on her kids.""  ""Blake introduces them to these down-home country things and Gwen and the kids love it. They all love going to Oklahoma and seeing the animals and doing fun things on his giant piece of land,"" the source continues. ""Blake is very much a father figure to her kids. The kids are very mature and Blake treats them as such. He loves them so much, he's always talking about them.""  Backgrid  Shelton -- who divorced Miranda Lambert in 2015 -- is also pretty smitten with Stefani. ""Blake is extremely devoted to Gwen and their life together. He feels like everything in life happens for a reason and although he was heartbroken after Miranda, this fantastic relationship and family came out of it,"" the source says, adding that ""they would still love to start a family together, but they're also happy with the family they have now.""  In an exclusive interview with ET in October, Shelton gushed over his girlfriend and her whole family.  ""It's been a lot of fun for me to be the one to get to expose them to this -- out in the country,"" he said. ""They love it so much, her entire family. And when I say her family, I mean all of them. I'm talking about the kids, the mom, the dad, the brother. There's times when we've had holiday gatherings, and I'm talking about 30-plus family members from her side, from my side.""  ""We have so much fun. I don't think you should be able to have that much fun,"" Shelton quipped. ""It's probably not legal in California.""

"Though the stars of ""Queer Eye"" ""don't want"" the upcoming third season of their Netflix hit to be a ""major departure"" from the previous two seasons, the cast's skyrocketing fame has undoubtedly affected the show.  Antoni Porowski and Tan France, two of the Fab Five, explained that their increased notoriety creates different reactions between them and the so-called ""heroes"" being made-over on ""Queer Eye,"" but they've made a conscious effort during filming this summer to take steps to combat that change.  ""For the most part, they’ve seen the show and know what it is,"" Antoni told AOL's Gibson Johns during a recent sit-down on behalf of Excedrin. ""Fans of the show approach it in many different ways: Some are just really excited and have a personal story to share about, like, their little brother who came out to their parents after seeing the A.J. episode, which f-cking pulls at your heart and makes you want to snot cry. And then there are people who get very afraid, because there’s this weird phenomenon where people get scared with people that are public and you stop them in their tracks.""  Tan added that it's not just their newfound ""celebrity"" titles that have altered the show, either: It's also the popularity of the show itself, which is available to stream on Netflix in countries all around the world. The idea of being watched by millions of people across the globe isn't always lost on the show's subjects.  ""Some of them also realize how big the show is globally,"" he explained to us. ""It was a very different experience last year, where they thought, 'Maybe nobody will watch this.' Now, they know that people are watching and they walk into this room with us and realize, ‘Oh sh-t, these cameras don’t just mean five people in the room -- they means millions are watching.'""  46 PHOTOS 'Queer Eye' star Antoni Porowski See Gallery 'Queer Eye' star Antoni Porowski NEW YORK, NEW YORK - APRIL 30: TV personality Antoni Porowski attends the 2019 City Harvest Gala at Cipriani 42nd Street on April 30, 2019 in New York City.

"On Thursday’s episode of The Late Late Show, James Corden introduced a new faux career venture: James Corden’s The Star Star Tours, which he joked would take celebrities around Los Angeles. The stars of Marvel Studios’ Avengers: Infinity War boarded a bus for the company's inaugural tour.  Tom Hiddleston was the first castmember to arrive. After Hiddleston introduced himself, a quiet Corden responded, “I’m sorry, I just got lost in your eyes.”  Paul Bettany, Chris Pratt, Benedict Cumberbatch, Pom Klementieff, Zoe Saldana, Winston Duke, Sebastian Stan, Letitia Wright, Elizabeth Olsen, Don Cheadle, Anthony Mackie and Josh Brolin then all boarded the bus one by one to join Hiddleston on the tour. “This is more stars than I could have dreamt of,” declared Corden during the boarding process.  While welcoming the group to the tour, Corden stated that flash photography was allowed. “Just make sure you tag me in all the photos,” he said. The host added, “Weapons are prohibited on the bus. That includes firearms, mace, war hammers, Vibranium and Infinity Gauntlets.”  Corden then checked that everyone was wearing sunscreen before assigning Cumberbatch and Pratt to apply sunscreen to his own legs.  The first stop on the tour was a local Coffee Bean. “That is where, when you shout out of a room, ‘Can someone get me a coffee?’ someone will run down to a shop very similar to that, and they will physically go in, wait in line and bring you back the coffee,” Corden explained to the actors.  The next planned activity was a sing-along led by bandleader Reggie Watts. ""I like outer space, looking at alien races. Utilizing energy weapons,” the group sang in unison following Watts’ lead. “If somebody attacks me, I have the skills to defend myself. And if somebody doubts me ... Well, that's too bad for them, because they gonna die.""  The actors then stopped to take pictures and learn about places like Barbra Streisand’s alleged holiday home and a popular brunch spot.  Brolin asked the tour guide if he could stop to use the bathroom, to which Corden explained an exclusive bathroom privilege that the actor did not yet have. “The problem with that, Josh, is, as rules on the Star Tours, you have to have appeared in three or more Marvel movies to use the bathroom. End-credit scenes don’t count.”  Corden then tried to get the scoop on the latest Marvel spoilers by asking if anyone on the bus dies in the next Avengers movie. After a moment of silence, Bettany shouted, “Snitches end up in ditches!”  The actors eventually made a pit stop at Golden Apple Comics, where they greeted fans, signed comic books and took pictures. As the Avengers stars were busy talking with fans, Corden stood by a Peter Rabbit poster, eagerly waiting for someone to ask for his autograph.  Once the group got back on the tour bus, Watts and Corden led another sing-along. “We save the world. We are Avengers. We’ll probably be doing these movies till we have dentures,” they sang. “Yeah, we’re hoping to escape without a scratch. We must protect the pretty face of Cumberbatch.”  As Corden wrapped up the tour, a very late Chris Hemsworth boarded the bus and tried to join. As his co-stars got off the bus, Corden reluctantly agreed to give the tour all over again for the tardy star."	1
"Carson Daly discovers touching 'goodbye' letter from his late mom  The unexpected death of Carson Daly's mom last month has taken its toll on the Today host, who has openly grieved the loss on social media.  But it seems Pattie Daly Caruso prepared to say goodbye nearly two decades before her fatal heart attack on Sept. 17 at her Palm Desert, Calif. home.  Daly shared on Instagram Wednesday that he and his sister, Quinn Daly, had unearthed a letter from his mom who was then ""in the thick of her breast cancer battle"" in 1998.  ""She clearly thought she might not make it,"" Daly captioned a snapshot of the letter. ""We never knew.""  Caruso lived to be 73.  ""Take good care of yourselves and each other,"" the letter reads.

"Date of Birth: February 11, 1969  February 11, 1969 Rumored Procedures: Rhinoplasty, lip injections, breast augmentation  Jennifer Aniston first made a name for herself in the 1990s starring as the lovable character Rachel on Friends. She quickly became a household name, even donning a signature haircut otherwise known as ""The Rachel."" Since her rocket to stardom, Aniston has also made headlines for her love life, marrying and subsequently divorcing Hollywood's leading man, Brad Pitt. Following her divorce, rumors have swirled that Aniston has surgically altered her appearance, including a modest breast enhancement and not-so-modest lip injections. While the actress publicly discusses her tough workout regimens, and declares that she is all-natural, one can't help but wonder: has America's sweetheart undergone cosmetic surgery?  Breast Augmentation  While many have speculated that Aniston has undergone breast enhancement, the actress adamantly denies the rumors, even chalking her fuller breasts up to weight gain and a few too many ""cheese boards."" The rumors were fueled by celebrity magazines that published photos of Aniston's breasts appearing fuller than ever during an appearance on the 2007 People's Choice Awards.  Rhinoplasty  A quick look at a ""then and now"" profile of Aniston leads many people to believe that she has undergone not one, but two rhinoplasty surgeries. In photos taken in the early 90s, Aniston's bridge and nostrils appear much wider than they do today. Aniston admitted to having a deviated septum corrected, but said she was unhappy with the results. In February 2007, Aniston made a second attempt to correct the problem, and was quoted as saying, ""best thing I ever did. I slept like a baby for the first time in years.""  Lip Injections  In 2008, Aniston was photographed with her lips looking a bit plumper than usual. Many magazines speculated that she received lip injection treatments after she emerged with a significantly larger upper lip. Some celebrity plastic surgeons even weighed in, noting a considerable difference. Luckily, Aniston's enhancement fit well with the rest of her features.  Choosing a Cosmetic Surgeon  Celebrities are no strangers to cosmetic surgery. In an environment where youth is highly prized, it would not be unexpected for Aniston, 40, to opt for cosmetic procedures to maintain her look. In fact the actress has stated that she will never rule out the possibility of receiving cosmetic treatments and supports actions that women take to feel better about their appearance. If Aniston has previously received cosmetic surgery, she has avoided criticism about her looks by choosing skilled plastic surgeons. One of the reasons it is so hard to tell if she underwent surgery is because her results are very natural-looking. This has helped keep her name off of any ""worst"" cosmetic surgery lists. No matter what your desired outcome, it is important to find a skilled professional to perform any kind of cosmetic surgery. Doing so will not only maintain the safety of your health, but it will also produce the natural-looking results that you desire.  Contact a Plastic Surgeon  Procedures such as rhinoplasty, breast augmentation, and lip injections can enhance your overall appearance. If you are interested in learning more about plastic surgery, contact a plastic surgeon in your area to find out if you are a good candidate for treatment.

Scott Disick is said to be in talks to write a tell-all book about the Kardashians which could see him earn a whopping $10 million.  According to Life & Style, Scott has been approached by multiple publishers, who have shown great interest in the concept of the book, considering that it would contain nothing but Kardashian scandals that fans would want to know about.  Now that Scott Disick has completely ended his relationship with Kourtney Kardashian and is happily seeing 19-year-old Sofia Richie, he feels as if nothing is holding him back from going ahead with the idea of writing a book about the famous family.  The amount of money that Scott Disick would pocket is definitely tempting for the socialite, who is famously known for being paid to party and appearing on Keeping Up With the Kardashians from time to time.  But, as previously mentioned, Scott doesn’t have any reason why he shouldn’t pull through with the idea since he’s no longer as close with the family as he once was, and the money he’s being offered is astoundingly high.  Everything forms his strained relationship with his ex-girlfriend to Kim’s alleged strained marriage with Kanye West will be talked about in the book.  In recent weeks, it has been said that Kourtney and Scott Disick have not been on good terms because the father of three is still furious over the supposed fact that the TV personality continues to flaunt her romance with boyfriend, Younes Bendjima.  Chilling A post shared by Scott Disick (@letthelordbewithyou) on Nov 25, 2017 at 3:08pm PST  Loading...  Though Scott Disick claims he has moved on with his life, he has not settled well with the idea of having his children around another man, particularly one who is much younger than Kourtney.  The statement itself heavily contradicts itself seeing that Scott is dating a 19-year-old, but for the self-proclaimed sex addict, he’s not fond of having another man around his kids, which has resulted to many arguments between the two.  Whether Scott Disick will end up pulling through with the tell-all book has yet to be determined, but with the way things are looking, there’s a possibility it could happen.  Slippery A post shared by Scott Disick (@letthelordbewithyou) on Nov 26, 2017 at 2:36pm PST  Scott has remained quiet on reports claiming that he’s considering the idea of penning a book about Kourtney and her family.	0

"John Cena is having a change of heart!  In a sneak peek of Sunday's episode of Total Bellas, the 41-year-old star meets with his ex-fiance, Nikki Bella, to discuss what led to their breakup. In earlier episodes of the E! reality series, it was made known that one of the main reasons the two were calling it quits was because John was not open to starting a family.  ""I don't think date nights could ever get old, but I think so many years down the road, to keep things exciting, I think kids help that in a relationship,"" Nikki, 34, tells John. ""I see the point of kids after you've been with someone for so long.""  John's main fear, it turns out, is that if he does agree to kids, Nikki will ""get bored"" of him regardless.  ""In a hypothetical universe, say I was like, ‘OK, we're going to have kids,' and we do and you find out that wasn't the real problem. And then years from now you look at me and resent [me],"" John explains. ""So, I'm talking to you tonight and I'm trying to ask all of these difficult questions because I don't know if you're just upset that you're not going to be a mom or if you've fallen out of love with me. Because it kind of feels like both. There's no way that I can interpret your actions over the last three months as anything different.""  Nikki assures John that she ""just want[s] to be a mom.""  ""To constantly wake up and just look at this beautiful thing that I made and to teach him new things,"" she says dreamily.  ""It's going to be a him? You said him,"" John points out.  The reality star tells her former flame, ""I feel like there's so much more I want to do with you and experience with you. It's just wanting to be a mom and knowing you will not be a dad.""  Nikki adds, ""So, it's me who has stuck around thinking I could be OK with it and I've just come to the realization that I'm not OK with it.""  With that declaration, John makes a jaw-dropping statement of his own.  ""So, it literally is just about being a mom?"" the Blockers star asks. ""OK, because I can't have you out of my life, ever, and I want to marry you. Relationship and marriage especially is about sacrifice, and I will make that sacrifice for you. I will give you a child.""  John's apparent new view regarding children comes nearly two months after the pair split in April. Since then, the pro wrestler has expressed his willingness to have children.  ""I'm willing to go back on all of these things I said, and a lot of things I was holding on to just out of stubbornness -- 'I won't have kids' -- and it took a really strong look in the mirror for me to be like, 'Why?'"" he said on Todayback in May. ""This person is my number one, and it's something that's very valuable to her, and of course we can do this ... all of that switched because I love her. She's my number one and I just want to make her happy ... and right now, she's happy.""  Meanwhile, Nikki said the time would heal all wounds for the couple.  ""It's going to take time. So, honestly, only time can tell,"" she told ET following her ex's Today show appearance. ""John and I, we absolutely love each other and we care about each other a lot. We are best friends and, right now, we're both giving each other time separately and maybe there's hope that we reunite in the future.""  Last month, a rep for Nikki revealed to ET that the WWE stars are ""working on their relationship.""  ""Nikki Bella and John Cena are working on their relationship and taking it day by day,"" the rep said. ""They appreciate all of their fans and their continued support.""

Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)  Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)  Mel B has won a five-year restraining order against her former nanny Lorraine Gilles who claims she enjoyed a seven year sexual relationship with the star.  The former Spice Girl — who is locked in a bitter divorce with her estranged husband Stephen Belafonte — sought the order after she alleged Gilles, 25, and husband had an affair behind her back which led to the nanny getting an abortion which she paid for.  Requesting a temporary restraining order Mel had already obtained against Gilles be extended, her lawyer Larry Bakman told Van Nuys court in Los Angeles he had presented evidence which showed a pattern of harassing and annoying behaviour from the nanny.  He told the judge: “There were a number of incidents over a matter of time all designed to harass and annoy my client.”  Neither Mel B or Gilles were present in court. Gilles also had no lawyer representing her at the hearing.  Bakman said he had presented six pieces of evidence and a sworn declaration from the singer which were taken into consideration by judge Shirley Watkins.  Judge Watkins ruled: “Miss Brown has need for a restraining order for Miss Gilles. The court will issue a personal and stay away order as requested.”  The ruling means Gilles must not harass Mel and must stay at least 100 yards clear of her — it now extends until midnight on May 3, 2022.  Last month Mel’s legal team got a temporary restraining order on Gilles to gain access to a storage locker Mel claimed contained sex tapes and photos.  The star claimed Gilles and Belafonte had threatened to make them public in an effort to destroy her reputation.  The storage locker was briefly touched on in Wednesday’s hearing with Bakman revealing they were now aware of more than one storage facility.  After the hearing he told The Sun: “There are other storage units that we are aware of but we have not obtained an order to get into those.  “We are attempting to work that out with the opposing counsel.”  He also confirmed the singer had not been able to get “what she needed” from the original storage unit.  He added: “At this point we are attempting to resolve the issue formally with Mr Belafonte’s attorney.”  Mel filed for divorce from Belafonte in March and then went on to file a restraining order against her estranged husband.  The ex-Spice Girl alleges a catalog of physical abuse and claimed Belafonte impregnated Gilles during their marriage.  She also claims he taped threesomes they had with other women and has been using the tapes to extort her. She alleged the tapes are being kept in a storage locker which only he and nanny Gilles have access to.  Belafonte’s lawyer Grace Jamra has previously said: “It will be clear to everyone that there are no sex tapes in the storage … [Gilles] had nothing to do with the storage facility. In fact, Ms. Brown terminated Lorraine before the items were placed in storage.”  Gilles, who once looked after the singer’s children Phoenix, 18, Angel, 10, and Madison, 5, sued Mel for defamation last month.  In it the former nanny, who is now married to Michael Bleau, alleges Mel knew about her relationship with Belafonte and instigated threesomes with them both.	1

"Samuel Bode Miller ( ; born October 12, 1977) is an American former World Cup alpine ski racer. He is an Olympic and World Championship gold medalist, a two-time overall World Cup champion in 2005 and 2008, and the most successful male American alpine ski racer of all time. He is also considered one of the greatest World Cup racers of all time with 33 race victories and being one of five men (and last to date) to win World Cup events in all five disciplines.[1] He is the only skier with five or more victories in each discipline. In 2008, Miller and Lindsey Vonn won the overall World Cup titles for the first U.S. sweep in 25 years.  Miller won six medals in the Winter Olympics, the most of any U.S. skier − two silvers (giant slalom and combined) in Salt Lake City 2002, a gold (super combined), a silver (super-G) and a bronze (downhill) in Vancouver 2010 and a bronze (super-G) in Sochi 2014. Miller is one of 5 skiers who have won Olympic medals in 4 different disciplines, matching the feats of Kjetil André Aamodt and female racers Anja Pärson, Janica Kostelić and Katja Seizinger.[2]  Miller ended his career with six discipline World Cup titles and also won four World Championships titles in four different disciplines (giant slalom, combined, super-G and downhill) and one silver medal in super-G. While his skiing career was coming to an end, Miller had switched his attention and investment to horse racing.[3] He officially retired from ski racing in October 2017.  Early years [ edit ]  Born in Easton, New Hampshire to Jo Kenney and Woody Miller, Miller grew up in nearby Franconia, a small community in the heart of New Hampshire's White Mountains that comprises the Cannon Mountain Ski Area. His family, including older sister Kyla, younger sister Wren (short for Genesis Wren Bungo Windrushing Turtleheart), and younger brother Chelone (full name Nathaniel Kinsman Ever Chelone Skan),[4] lived on 450 acres (1.8 km2) of land in a forest, where his parents celebrated solstices, in a log cabin without electricity or indoor plumbing. He was raised a vegetarian.[5] He was homeschooled until the third grade, but after his parents divorced, he began attending public school.[citation needed] He applied for and got a scholarship to the Carrabassett Valley Academy, a ski racing academy in Maine. His mother's parents owned and started the Tamarack Tennis Camp, and he has played tennis and soccer since childhood.[citation needed]  Miller first gained widespread recognition after winning two silver medals at the 2002 Salt Lake City Winter Olympics in the giant slalom and combined events, though he had been known to skiing fans since he burst onto the international scene as an 18-year-old in 1996. Miller is known for his reckless style, often risking crashes to increase his chances of winning a given race; in his book, Bode: Go Fast, Be Good, Have Fun, Miller stated that his goal as a skier was not to win medals, but rather to ski ""as fast as the natural universe will allow"" and ""bang as many hot chicks on the slopes as you can."" In 2006, Miller also became famous for his reclusive (but outspoken) personality and his attention-getting statements.[citation needed]  Ski racing career [ edit ]  The Beginnings (1998–2001) [ edit ]  Miller not only first appeared in the World Cup during the 1998 season but also represented the United States in the 1998 Nagano Olympics, competing in both of the technical disciplines (giant slalom and slalom).[6] In 1999, he also competed in super-G (which is considered a speed discipline, not a technical one) and represented the U.S. in all three events at the World Ski Championships at Beaver Creek, with a best finish of 8th in slalom. He finally achieved a podium in a giant slalom at Val d'Isère on December 17, 2000 (placing third), but then only competed in super-G at the 2001 World Ski Championships; he crashed during the downhill portion of the combined and tore knee ligaments, which ended his competition.[7]  Doubl"	1
"Both Prince Harry's major exes, Cressida Bonas and Chelsy Davy, attended his royal wedding to Meghan Markle last weekend. But days before the actual ceremony, Harry and Davy had a final, emotional phone call, Vanity Fair reports. Davy was Harry's most serious girlfriend before Markle; they dated on and off for seven years, from 2004 to 2011. As recently as September 2015, The Sun and other outlets were reporting Harry still had feelings for her and that the two tried to make their relationship work again in summer 2015. They had ""one last hurrah"" in Africa, and their time there was kept secret from the press. Ultimately, they split because Davy didn't want to lead such a public life.  Davy was not invited to the second, more intimate reception, and she practically didn't even go to the wedding at all after her call with Harry, a family friend told Vanity Fair. “It was their final call, a parting call in which they both acknowledged Harry was moving on,"" the source said. ""Chelsy was quite emotional about it all, she was in tears and almost didn’t go to the wedding. In the end, she went and promised Harry she wouldn’t try and gatecrash the party.”  So Davy went to the ceremony, and during the broadcast of it, the internet noticed and memed her expressions:  But the history between these two is emotional. In September 2015, a source told The Sun: “Harry still holds a candle for her. Chelsy has his heart. They saw each other recently. There’s still very much something between them, but Chelsy won’t commit yet because she doesn’t want to lead a life in the spotlight. Harry’s very sensitive to that.”  Together on May 7, 2010 Getty Images  And royal reporter and Prince Harry biographer Katie Nicholl echoed this to InStyle ahead of the royal wedding: “You sort of get the feeling that neither of them were quite ever willing to completely let go of that love affair. They’d carved their names into one of the tree trunks on the family estate. It was such a love affair, it really was. Right up until 2015 they were trying to give it another chance. I was quite struck by that and I think everyone that’s been in love, you know, you never forget your first love, and in that respect I think Prince Harry was no different. And I think what’s so lovely is he still manages to have a friendship with Chelsy, and there’s that amazing respect between the two of them. Neither of them have spoken about their relationship and I think you have to respect and admire them for that.”  At a rugby match together on November 22, 2008. Getty Images  Getty Images  According to The Sun, Davy and Harry met in Cape Town during Harry's gap year; Davy studied law then and ended up going to Leeds University so she could be closer to him. She attended several events with Harry, including Prince Charles' 60th birthday. She met the Queen at a wedding and was also invited to his brother Prince William and Kate Middleton's wedding despite she and Harry not dating at the time. Vanity Fair reports that Harry thought inviting Davy and Bonas to his wedding was the ""right thing to do,"" a pal told the outlet—despite and because of their past."	1

Scott still has a thing for Kourtney (Picture: WireImage)  Scott Disick has admitted that he still has the hump for Kourtney Kardashian.  BTS win artist of the year at Melon Music Awards as they continue world domination  Scott split from the eldest of the Kardashian brood in 2015 after nine years together, following his constant partying and binge drinking lifestyle.  And although the pair have actively remained in each other’s lives and seem on very amicable terms, it appears that the 33-year-old is still very much into the reality star.  In an upcoming episode of Keeping Up The With The Kardashians, Kourtney’s sister Khloe grills him about whether or not they kissed during a family vacation in Mexico last year, before proceeding to inquire about his sausage.  Scott jokingly revealed that Kourtney ‘didn’t kiss me back when we were together,’ but the ever consistent Khloe continued to probe and asked: ‘Did your sausage like move in your pants a little because it got excited?’  Advertisement  Advertisement  Seriously, Khloe?  Scott responded candidly: ‘I’m still turned on by her, if that’s what you’re asking.’  The father-of-three then admitted that he was still very much in love with his ex and mother of his children despite there being no immediate prospect of them getting back together.  He said: ‘I feel like I will never be over her. She’s the love of my life, but I just try to do everything to be there for her, but there’s literally no appreciation for anything ever.’  However, Scott owned up to the breakdown of the long term relationship and was adamant that the 37-year-old was not aware about how much she means to him.  ‘I just hope that one day she understands that I would never want to be with anybody but her.’  Scott and Kourtney are parents to 7-year-old Mason, Penelope, 4 and 2-year-old Reign.

History [ edit ]  Former logo of the show, from before 2010  After the success of two one-hour specials chronicling Kate Gosselin and her then-husband Jon, Surviving Sextuplets and Twins and One Year Later, the series aired on the Discovery Health Channel for the first two seasons before being moved to TLC. During its run, the series was one of the network's highest-rated programs,[2] with the fifth-season premiere seen by a record 9.8 million viewers, the most watched show of that evening including broadcast television, twice as many viewers as the show’s previous series high.[3]  After the Gosselins' divorce in 2009, the final episode of Jon & Kate Plus 8 aired on November 23, 2009, announced by TLC three days earlier.[4][5]  The series was later renamed Kate Plus 8 on June 6, 2010,[6] focusing on Kate as a divorced mother raising the children, with Jon appearing less frequently.[7] However, filming was later suspended due to Jon's lawyers delivering letters to TLC demanding that they cease and desist production and barred production crews from the couple's Pennsylvania property on October 1, 2009.[8][9][10] This led to putting the show's revamping on hold. TLC planned for ""a series of specials"" if the series did not go into production.[11]  The second season of Kate Plus 8 premiered on April 4, 2011, though on August 15, TLC announced that the series would be cancelled after it reached 150 episodes. The last episode aired on September 12, 2011.[12]  On March 19, 2014, it was announced that Kate and her eight would return in a reunion special, scheduled to air in June.[13]  In August 2014, it was announced that Kate Plus 8 would return for another season (its third, and first after an almost three-year hiatus) on January 13, 2015 on TLC.[14]  Season 4 of Kate Plus 8 started on December 8, 2015.[15]  Season 5 of Kate Plus 8 started on November 22, 2016.[16]  Season 6, with three episodes, started July 10, 2017.[17]  Family [ edit ]  Parents  Children  # Name Date of birth 1 Cara Nicole ( 2000-10-08 ) October 8, 2000 (age 19) 2 Madelyn ""Mady"" Kate 3 Alexis Faith ( 2004-05-10 ) May 10, 2004 (age 15) 4 Hannah Joy 5 Aaden Jonathan 6 Collin Thomas 7 Leah Hope 8 Joel Kevin  Production [ edit ]  Between the specials and the series, permanent light fixtures were installed in the Gosselins' second home to make filming easier and prevent the kids from tripping over the wires and cables from temporary lighting. Jon & Kate Plus 8 filmed three days per week, with one day used for interview sessions where Jon, Kate and occasionally the children, discussed events occurring in each episode. In the family's first house, the ""interview corner"" was located in the basement, and was transformed from the playroom when needed. It was painted green, unlike the rest of the playroom. In their new house, the interview set was reproduced in an unfinished area of the basement. At season four's finale, Jon and Kate said they would make a new set for season five.  Criticisms were raised regarding Kate's intentions of continuing with the show, as well as whether or not the children were being exploited or were under emotional distress.[18] According"	1
"Kim Kardashian broke the Internet. Beyoncé shut it down. But Will Smith brought it back to life the day he joined Instagram.  While the social media platform launched back in 2018, it wasn't until one fateful day in December 2017 that the Fresh Prince decided to post his first IG picture. It's been on ever since.  The charismatic super star let fans into his childhood when he shared a baby photo that required no filters. Approximately seven IG posts later, he had everyone hooked, especially when he showed just how proud he is to be a father by uploading a split image of Jaden and himself in similar poses at two different events.  Will then reminded his fans and binge watchers everywhere to keep watching Netflix (before the whole Mo’Nique boycott went down).  But it isn't just his wit and family pics that has everyone following Smith—it's his life advice. From inspirational posts laced with comedic timing, to his musings on what it takes to make a marriage last, Smith's insight never comes off as preachy, which people obviously relate to. Since joining in December, his followers have swelled to 8.9 million.  Bottom line? There are many reasons to love Will Smith's Instagram— nine major keys to be exact.  He's Motivational  No matter the subject, Will always finds new ways of encouraging people to cut the dead weight out of their lives, so that they can shine brighter.  He Inspires New Perspectives  Smith's response to this young artist's animation proves he’s not afraid to look at himself through someone else’s eyes.  His Co-Signs Are Everything  He waited approximately 2,700 days to launch his IG account but he used Ellen Degeneres' talk show as the plug when he did. Enough said.  He Defines Cultural Ideas  The now 49-year-old actor started off as a big-eared kid from Philly looking to make it. Somewhere along the way he transformed into an inebriated super hero, but not before experiencing life as one of the world's soul survivors. Now he's a full blown family man who's still doing backflips on a big screen while banking millions. He personifies the phrase, ""Black don't crack!""  He Always Remembers His Roots  Smith may be worth around $260 million, but he never forgets where he came from.  He Has the Best Friends  Understandably, Will Smith has a lot of high-ranking friends in a lot of high-ranking places. But sometimes, it’s not about the money or the fame. Sometimes it’s just having a lot of (high-ranking) celebrity friends who care just as much about the culture as you do.  He Shows His Family A Lot Of Love  Through all his stardom, Will has always seems to put family first. With his family by his side, he shows the new generation it’s still cool to be a family man.  He's All About Self-Empowerment  He announced he was starting a vlog to show people the things they can do when they’re not sleeping— and what he’s doing when we are.  He's A Genius  Will showed us he can rap and act, but when he jumped on camera and conquered a Rubik’s Cube, we realized he can do anything – even master the philosophies of a colorful square puzzle."	1
Turns out Cupid’s arrow will indeed puncture Meredith Grey’s battered heart this season. Grey’s Anatomy showrunner Krista Vernoff reveals to TVLine that the ABC drama’s titular MD “will very much be part of our ‘Season of Love.'” TV's Big Cast Changes (2018-2019)  Clarifying remarks made Tuesday by ABC’s spoiler-avoidant president Channing Dungey, who downplayed buzz that that Season 15 would find Meredith re-entering the dating scene for the first time since the death of her beloved McDreamy nearly four years ago, Vernoff shares, “Channing was keeping it mellow and trying to avoid spoilers because Shondaland is secrecy land. But as the showrunner, I can confirm for you that Meredith Grey is very much a part of our Season of Love.”  As Vernoff explains, “Yes, [Mer]’s a single mom, and that complicates a dating life. And yes, she’s a surgical marvel with new, game changing medical ideas she’ll be pursuing. But she also hasn’t dated at all since [Martin Henderson’s] Nathan Riggs left [in Season 13]. And the one-two punch of meeting [Scott Speedman’s] Nick Marsh awoke a desire in her that she can’t put back to sleep.  “The question this season,” Vernoff adds, “is not ‘Will Meredith Grey find love again,’ but ‘With whom will she find love?'”  Speaking of Speedman’s fan-favorite character, Vernoff divulges the real reason the show didn’t pursue a romance between Nick and a clearly smitten Meredith. “We all loved him, but Nick was designed as a one episode guest star,” the EP notes, “which is the whole reason Scott agreed to come play him!”	1
"Jimmy Kimmel loves to joke around, even if it gets him in trouble.  In an interview from his February 2018 GQ cover story posted earlier this week, the 50-year-old late night host opened up about the infamous 2013 Twitter feud with Kanye West.  “I live for moments like that. When I got in a Twitter battle with Kanye, I was so happy,"" Kimmel told the mag. ""My wife makes fun of me. She's like, ‘You are so happy right now.’ I'm absolutely beaming. I feel very confident in a situation like that.""  The online war began when Kimmel did a parody sketch on his show, making fun of the rapper's BBC interview in which he claimed he was the ""biggest"" rock star. West didn't appreciate the joke and exploded on Twitter, calling out Kimmel.  ""JIMMY KIMMEL IS OUT OF LINE TO TRY AND SPOOF IN ANY WAY THE FIRST PIECE OF HONEST MEDIA IN YEARS,"" West tweeted at the time, followed by more NSFW comments.  The feud was eventually squashed when West made an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! this past October. Then for Kimmel's 50th birthday, Kim Kardashian West read one of her husband's infamous tweets during the show's ""Mean Tweets"" segment.  “JIMMY KIMMEL PUT YOURSELF IN MY SHOES… OH NO THAT MEANS YOU WOULD HAVE GOTTEN TOO MUCH GOOD P**Y IN YOUR LIFE,” she read aloud.  Meanwhile, Kimmel is gearing up to host the Oscars for a second year in a row. Hollywood has already been very vocal about the recent sexual harassment and misconduct allegations within the industry, and Kimmel is ready to tackle the subject during awards night.  “I'm surprisingly not nervous,” he said. “I think there are certain groups of people who think I shouldn't make any jokes about that situation. And there are groups of people who will be mad if I don't make jokes about that situation. So you just kind of have to figure it out. Whatever I do will be criticized by someone. Like, ‘You didn't make enough jokes about Harvey Weinstein.'""  For more on Kimmel, watch below.

Kate mixed old favorites with new pieces for today’s engagements with Prince William.  Kensington Palace announced this morning these would be the last engagements for the Duchess before she starts maternity leave. Below, Kate meeting students who welcomed the couple to the Copper Box Arena at London’s Olympic Park.  Today’s events are designed to celebrate the Commonwealth as part of the ramp-up to the April Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in London. The first engagement was with SportsAid.  Prince William played some wheelchair basketball with athletes hoping to compete at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham.  More from the Newham Recorder:  The royals watched a wheelchair basketball session before meeting the players, including television presenter Ade Adepitan, who won a Paralympic bronze at Athens in 2004. Prince William then had a go at the sport himself, taking three attempts to net a basketball from a wheelchair as his wife Kate, who is due to give birth to the couple’s third child in the next few weeks, watched on.  Perhaps the Duchess is offering a few tips….?  Kate and William also spent time speaking with the athletes.  Back to the Recorder story:  Annually, SportsAid supports more than 1,000 athletes, mainly teenagers, with money towards training and competing costs. The charity also helps develop other vital skills for professional athletes by providing media training, nutritional advice and performance lifestyle guidance.

"Kate Hudson has opened up about how her romance with Danny Fujikawa began. The Almost Famous star has said that they suddenly fell in love at the end of last year even though they have known each other for many years.  Speaking to E! News, the 38-year-old actress said that they started dating last December and it has been a ""really amazing, calm relationship"". The couple has known each other for years since her musician boyfriend is her friends Sara Foster and Erin Foster's stepbrother.  ""He makes me happy,"" Hudson said on the red carpet of the premiere of her new movie Marshall on Saturday.  ""I've known him for many years, but we never saw each other like that until a year ago now—well, last December, where we just sort of looked at each other and went, 'Oh, wow. This is weird. I really like you' and the rest is history,'"" Hudson added.  It isn't the first time Hudson has gushed over her boyfriend. She previously called him ""the best"" after he accompanied her to the premiere of the movie Snatched.  ""He's standing very nicely, waiting. He's the best! I've known him a long time,"" she had said.  Hudson's admiration for Fujikawa came after Kurt Russell, who has been in a long-term relationship with her mother Goldie Hawn, said he ""approves"" of her beau.  ""He's a nice guy, Danny. Yeah, I like him. I always approve. He's a great guy. Yeah, he's very special actually ... Kate brings good guys,"" Russell had said.

"The 36-year-old racing driver was the first female host for the sports award show.  Love is in the air.  Danica Patrick and Aaron Rodgers couldn't keep their eyes off each other while they made their red carpet debut as a couple at the 2018 ESPY Awards at Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on Wednesday.

"Moving out from home to attend university is a pretty tumultuous time for any teenager and parent.  If it's not the empty room you leave behind, it's the comfort of a home-cooked meal, the occasional hug from a family member and, for parents, the security of knowing your child is home, safe, and cared for.  One person in particular who appears to be struggling with the forthcoming move-out date of her first born is Victoria Beckham, who's son Brooklyn is heading off to New York City to attend college next month.  Getty Images  In an interview with GQ magazine, the 18-year-old star – who recently added his seventh tattoo to his body since April - admitted: 'I'm nervous, and my mum's upset about me leaving.  'But it's really exciting. I kind of live in the moment. I don't think people in New York will annoy me, and I feel like when I go there, I'll meet lifelong friends. Stuff like that,' he added.  I'm nervous, and my mum's upset about me leaving  Two words Brooklyn: Beer pong.  Getty Images  Despite his mother's anguish at her eldest child moving out, the British-born star admits his parents have always been supportive of his photography endeavours.  'I do backstage photography at my mum's shows,' the teenager told the publication.  'And I mean, I love doing it—but my mum's like, ""Go take pictures of the models!"" and I'm a bit shy. So I kind of have to get the first two out of the way, and then I'm used to it,' he added, weeks after the release of his first photography book, What I See.  Brooklyn's comments comes days after David Beckham's Instagram posts which show him building Harper a Disney princess castle.  After pulling an all-nighter earlier this week to finish the project, David posted a snap of himself - topless - captioning the snap: '1am done... Someone's gonna have a nice surprise in the morning.'  This family is too cute right now."	1
He is a prince raised in London, the son of the first heir to the British throne.  She is an actress born in California, the daughter of a yoga instructor and a former television lighting director.  But despite their different upbringings, Prince Harry and his American girlfriend Meghan Markle have more in common than we previously believed.  A genealogical investigation by The Mail on Sunday has found that the famous pair are actually distant cousins, related through a late 15th Century ancestor of the Queen Mother.  Getty Images  The publication reports the Suits star's connection to the Royal Family comes as a result of her family's ancestry dating all the bay back to High Sheriff of County Durham Ralph Bowes - an ancestor of Markle from 15 generations ago.  Bowes' family seat was Streatlam Castle situated in the North East of England and his grandson Christopher Hussey moved to America in 1632, helping to found Nantucket, Massachusetts. Fast forward a few years and boom, Meghan Markle.  Meanwhile, Bowes's great-grandson Sir George Bowes became a member of parliament during the reign of Charles II and to cut a very long story short, Prince Harry came along.  What's more bizarre is the fact that Prince Harry's ancestor, Henry VIII, reportedly executed a relative of Markle.  A new report, via The Sunday Telegraph, claims that back when Henry VIII was reigning in Britain, there was a plot orchestrated by a man named Lord Hussey, 1st Baron Hussey of Sleaford and the great-great-great grandfather to Christopher Hussey (see above), to attempt to overthrow the monarch. As a result, Henry VIII had him beheaded.  Now, before everyone stars yelling 'incest' at Harry and Meghan's shared lineage, we'd like to point out that if you go far back enough to the Middle Ages, you're probably related to the man sitting next to you on the bus or your colleague sat opposite to you.  A genetic survey in 2013 found that all Europeans living today are related to the same set of ancestors who lived 1,000 years ago. And you don't have to go back much further in time to to find that everyone in the world is related to each other.  Who would've though it, ey?  The news comes days after Channel 4's aired a documentary looking into the Californian star's life, titled When Harry Met Meghan: A Royal Romance.	1
Taylor Swift’s newest album Reputation is full of many more pop-oriented twists and turns than anything she’s ever released before, including her 2014 hit 1989, and the latest behind-the-scenes video she’s shared details the making of one of the most processed and manipulated songs on the album.  All the vocal processing on “Delicate” is stripped back in the first part of three clips that Taylor shared last night, as she sings the song unadorned into the mic, and then gets a snippet of it back with the kind of vocal effects added that most of us still associate with Imogen Heap.  In the second clip, above, she tries to parse out where the rhythms on a particularly syncopated section is, and notices the camera right at the end of the filming session. The final clip gets much more goofy, as Taylor, Shellback (the producer name of Karl Johan Schuster), and Max Martin are almost finished with their creation, and begin to get a little goofy. Toward the end of this clip, Taylor flips the camera around so fans can see the recording studio, and notes the dancing and silliness “means he likes it!’  It’s easy to see why, too, though Reputation is easily Taylor’s most flawed album to date, “Delicate” is one of the standouts. Listen below if you haven’t heard it yet.	1
"A few months after Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pitt in the fall of 2016, several tabloids linked the actor to another one of the hottest actresses in Hollywood: Kate Hudson. Earlier this year, sources told E! News the romance rumors were false—but still, they persisted.  So, when Hudson appeared on Bravo's Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen Tuesday, she was more than happy to set the record straight, once and for all. ""That was the craziest rumor of all time,"" said Hudson, who was promoting her book. ""There's nothing true to that.""  ""As a matter of fact,"" Hudson said, ""I hadn't actually seen him in, like, four years."" Pitt, who remains single, isn't the worst person to be falsely associated with, of course. ""It was kind of an awesome rumor,"" the actress joked. ""I kind of liked it. I was like, 'OK, fine. We're having twins!'"""	0

They may have had the sassiest relationship on screen in High School Musical, but it turns out that Ashley Tisdale and Lucas Grabeel actually hated each other IRL.  When Sharpay and Ryan reunited recently to perform a slow version of What I’ve Been Looking For as part of Ash’s YouTube music series, they explained that it took a few years for them to turn into the BFFs that they are today.  ‘We were not close. We were not good friends, lets be honest. We hated each other, I’m not kidding,’ Ash said of when they first met.  ‘We did not get off on the best foot,’ Lucas adds.  ‘I think I was definitely a lot like Sharpay and was like who is this person? After we wrapped though I’ve always had a love for you, you are literally like my twin brother,’ Ashley lovingly continued.  PHEW. We well as long as they’re not faking it now then that’s totally fine, because they've now actually transformed in Sharpay and Ryan only without the mean streaks.  Also how ridiculous is their cover of the classic HSM ballad? Brb just going to watch the film one more time.	1

‘All men must die, but we are not men’ – Game of Thrones (S06E03)  Despite the whoring and arguably gratuitous nudity in ‘Book of the Stranger’, this week’s episode was refreshingly positive for female characters, and ranks alongside ‘Home’ in quality and story progression.  It makes sense to begin at the beginning: specifically the long awaited Sansa-John reunion. A sensible decision by the writers to forego yet another ‘missed them by that much’ moment helped spark life into the plot of the North, and saved this particular sub-plot from becoming any more farcical. It was a warm moment – it felt almost inevitable that somebody’s head or genitalia would roll across the screen at some point. Thankfully not.  Apparently Jon’s been listening to Elliott Smith songs on repeat since his resurrection and thinking about the human condition, as the hurting hero seemed averse to any further violence, even to save his own family. Enter Sansa. Who knows what should be credited for the maturation of the Stark girl – there are plenty of qualifying tragedies in her arc – but she was on impressive form. Her stern persuasiveness ensured that viewers will eventually get to see ‘Bastardbowl’ – the internet’s preferred nomenclature for any battle between Snow and Bolton. Unfortunately, given her new found confidence, it would be unsurprising to see Sansa finally meet her maker(s) this season. For now, though, her transformation is welcome.  Not to be overshadowed, Brienne shone at Castle Black, too. Melisandre and Ser Davos played no real part in the episode, besides being in receipt of Brienne’s barbs regarding her execution of Stannis. There was overt sexual tension between herself and Tormund, too, in a quasi-fetish dinner scene.  The next stop for ‘Book of the Stranger’ was somewhere in the proximity of the Vale. Little Finger’s falcon will hopefully peck out the eyes of the endlessly irritating young lord, Robin. Flippancy aside, the decision to ‘help’ Sansa and Jon in their battle versus Ramsay revealed little in terms of motive, other than that Baelish must see success in the future of House Stark.  On to Meereen, where Tyrion appeared to badly misrepresent his new queen. Making peace with the masters of Slaver’s Bay may have been diplomatic, but is unlikely to endear himself to Danaerys, and received dreadful feedback from Grey Worm and Missandei.  Jorah was frankly pathetic in this episode as his greyscale caught up with him, and the unbearably smug Daario played bodyguard for his love rival as a result. Having traveled so far, it nicely summarised the episode that, rather than being slung over their shoulders, Danaerys chose self-determination and relegated the two noble soldiers to doormen.  In much the same way as Sansa, Margaery was the stronger sibling in King’s Landing. Not to fall prey to the silver tongue of the High Sparrow, she instead attempts to manipulate him, reciting verses from The Seven-Pointed Star. Sent, she believes, to break her brother, she instead encourages him to stay strong. Sadly, these attempts may have been in vain; indeed, it looks to have been the High Sparrow’s intention for her instead to be broken by her brother, sucked in by his weakness.  With Tommen being manipulated every which way by everybody and their dog in King’s Landing, Lady Tyrell’s decision to introduce her army to the fray was encouraging. With her actions and Cersei’s we saw yet more decisiveness on the part of the show’s female characters.  A short visit to the Iron Islands saw Theon returning to his sister (who he previously unceremoniously pleasured, much to her amusement). After a frosty introduction, where Yara told her brother stop being such a wimp, Theon lent his support to her claim to the throne.  Back across the sea, Ramsay sat in Winterfell, badly peeling an apple. Enter Osha, who tried to seduce and assassinate him, only to find her own neck irrigating the cobbled ground. This was an anti-climax in her arc, as her lengthy disa	1

A number of things had caused her to question William’s commitment, although she had not raised them with him yet. One was William’s friendship with an American heiress named Anna Sloan, whom he had met through mutual friends at Edinburgh University, where Anna was studying. Anna had lost her father, businessman George Sloan, in a tragic shooting accident on the family’s 360-acre estate in Nashville, and she and William had bonded over the loss of their parents. When William accepted an invitation from Anna to accompany her and a group of friends to Tennessee for a holiday before he went to Greece, it hurt Kate deeply. She suspected William might have feelings for the 22-year-old heiress. However, according to her friends, Anna was not romantically interested in William, and the friendship was never anything more than just that.  And then there was William’s budding relationship with another stunning heiress, Isabella Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe. While Kate was girl-next-door pretty, Isabella had cover-girl looks, a title, and a stately pile to boot. That summer William visited the Anstruther-Gough-Calthorpe family home in Chelsea to see her. Isabella, daughter of banking heiress Lady Mary Gaye Curzon, was single at the time. Sadly for William, she had no aspirations to date him and despite his amorous advances declared that she was not interested.  Meanwhile, Kate had accepted an invitation to spend a fortnight in France at Fergus Boyd’s family holiday home in the Dordogne with some friends from St. Andrews. Among the group were Kate’s friends Olivia Bleasdale and Ginny Fraser. She had not told them about the trial separation, but from her downcast mood her friends guessed, and one evening she confided to them that she and William were taking a break. “She got quite drunk on white wine and really let her guard down,” recalled one of the group. “She was debating whether or not she should text or call him. She said how sad she was and how much she was missing William, but she never mentioned it after that.”  By November they were back at St. Andrews, although they had yet to reconcile their differences. I had reported the news of their separation that summer, and tellingly there was no denial from Clarence House. Privately, William again complained to friends that he was feeling claustrophobic and already thinking ahead to the summer after graduation, when he was planning to return to Kenya to see Jecca Craig, another fly in the ointment as far as Kate was concerned. “The last thing William wants is a high-profile split in the crucial months leading up to his finals,” I was told at the time by a source close to William. On the advice of her mother, Kate gave William some breathing space. It was made all the harder because they were living together, but instead of spending weekends in St. Andrews or traveling to Balmoral, Kate would return home to be with her parents.  It was obviously the break that William needed, and by Christmas they were back together again, although Kate had a condition. Word had reached her of William’s visits to Isabella, and Kate insisted that William was not to contact her again. With their finals looming in May, they agreed to take things slowly. Kate had stayed away from Edward van Cutsem’s wedding to the Duke of Westminster’s daughter Lady Tamara Grosvenor that November, but she happily accepted an invitation to Prince Charles’s 56th-birthday party at Highgrove later that month. The following March, Prince Charles invited her to Klosters for his pre-wedding holiday. Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles were to be married on April 9, 2005, and the Prince wanted one last skiing holiday with his sons first. It had really been intended as a boys-only trip, but Kate was not left out. She was photographed taking a gondola up the slopes with Charles and enjoying lunch with the princes and their friends. William was a witness at the civil ceremony, together with Camilla’s son, Tom, and had the added responsibil	0

Their engagement was announced in November 2010. They married on 29 April 2011 at Westminster Abbey. The couple's children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte, and Prince Louis of Cambridge, are third, fourth, and fifth in the line of succession to the British throne, respectively.[4][5][6][7][8]  The Duchess of Cambridge's charity works focus mainly on issues surrounding young children, addiction, and art.

"Sometimes, it can be difficult to get along with your folks. When you throw in the fact that the person in question is a celebrity, someone whose life is constantly under scrutiny, and the parents are also celebrities, it can get a bit crazy at times. This can lead to estrangement between parents and their child and sadly, it happens a lot more than you might think.  This seems to be a problem more for actors than other types of celebrities, which may have to do with their time in the spotlight. Whether a younger actor or actress ends up despising their parent(s) for taking their income while they worked as a child or they spoke about them to the press in a bad way, some stars just want nothing to do with their folks anymore.  In a lot of cases, estrangement can go on for years and might only end when a parent or child is lying on their death bed. In other cases, the estrangement never ends and a parent can pass on before a reconciliation can occur.  We found a good number of stars whose parents were also actors and actresses that don't get along any longer. Whatever the reason, here are 15 Actors Completely Estranged From Their Famous Parents.  15 ANGELINA JOLIE - JON VOIGHT  Angelina Jolie is one of the most famous actresses on the planet. She is an Academy Award winner and a Goodwill ambassador whose work across the globe has been hailed by many. She is also the daughter of John Voight, one of the most celebrated actors from the 1970s. They two were estranged for years, due to her father's infidelity concerning her late mother as well as a comment he made publicly in 2002 saying Jolie ""needed help"" and suffered from ""mental problems.""  The two have made several attempts to reconcile their relationship for the sake of Jolie's children. She has six kids who all call Voight their grandfather, which has led Voight claimed they had recovered their relationship in 2011 using Bradd Pitt, Jolie's husband at the time, as a go-between. They made some strides towards reconciling, but their relationship is far from fully recovered.  14 LINDSAY LOHAN - MICHAEL LOHAN  Lindsay Lohan has certainly had her own problems over the years. She may have fallen prey to the curse of the ""Child Actor"" given that she grew up in the spotlight and eventually got into a lot of trouble thanks to drugs and alcohol. Her issues have landed her in trouble with the law, but these issues pale in comparison to her tumultuous relationship with her father, Michael Lohan, whose personal fame is almost entirely derived from his famous daughter.  When asked about her father in May 2013 by Piers Morgan, she said, ""He won't change. I just think there comes a point where you just kind of have to accept what it is. Whenever I do try to bring him back into my life, he creates chaos for me and uses it to his advantage. He's been really good and then really crazy my whole life.""  The two barely get along when they are talking to one another, and while she has expressed hope that he will change, the two are currently estranged.  13 EMMA ROBERTS - ERIC ROBERTS  Emma Roberts has been getting work in Hollywood for a number of years and is probably best known for her roles in We're The Millers, Scream Queens, and American Horror Story. She is related to a number of famous folks, including her aunt Julia Roberts and her father, Eric Roberts - with whom she has a tumultuous relationship.  Her father has had a pretty bad relationship with his sister, Julia for years, but he and his daughter have been estranged since he divorced her mother when Emma was just a baby. Estrangement throughout the family seems to be the norm. In addition to Eric's bad relationship with his sister and daughter, Julia had a bad relationship with her half-sister, Nancy Motes, who passed away from a drug overdose in 2014, just a day before Emma's 23rd birthday.  Though they have a poor relationship, Eric came out in defense of his daughter when she was arrested for domestic violence in 2013.  12 DREW BARRY"	0
Statistics! Statistics! Call Me by Your Name star Timothée Chalamet was a high-school rap prodigy, according to a video uncovered by blogger My New Plaid Pants. Four short years ago, ya boy Lil Timmy Tim rapped about statistics, problem sets, and his teacher Ms. Lawton. Come on — who among us hasn’t had to produce a goofy educational rap for extra credit? After Twitter cruelly suspended @ArmieDancingTo, news of Chalamet’s rap career is just the salve we need in these dark times.  Before you foolishly suggest Lil Timmy Tim was a one-hit wonder, observe: Here’s a 2011 rap — “15-year-old white boy, not Justin baby” — complete with a dougie.

"This isn't the first time Blake's been drinking has been in the spotlight.  Country singer and Voice judge Blake Shelton fell on stage while performing at a music festival in Oregon this past weekend. The following day, he tweeted out a plea for the footage and admitted he had been drinking.  “Ok Pendleton I know somebody is bound to have video of me falling on stage last night,” The 42-year-old wrote. “Please!! I have to see it! Post that sh-t! And yes I had been drinking. A lot…”  Video of the singer falling quickly spread around the internet.  Ok Pendleton I know somebody is bound to have video of me falling on stage last night!! Please!! I have to see it!!! Post that shit! And yes I had been drinking. A lot.. — Blake Shelton (@blakeshelton) July 15, 2018  In the video, Shelton is seen losing his balance while holding a microphone. He quickly gets back up and grabs his guitar. While some people found the fall entertaining, many people were not amused.  “So, that’s the type of quality show that you put on … for people that spend their hard earned money to come see you, is for you to show up drunk?” one follower said. “That’s some Justin Bieber on Hennessy, throwing up on stage, nonsense right there!”  Shelton retweeted that message and said: ""Oh I’m sorry ma’am... This account is meant for people who actually have a sense of humor.. We’re not accepting cry baby tweets today.. Maybe try again tomorrow!""  This isn't the first time Shelton's drinking has come into the spotlight.  After his divorce from fellow country superstar Miranda Lambert in 2015, rumors began circling that he was headed down a dangerous, alcohol-filled spiral. In Touch published a front-page story alleging that he was ""drinking vodka before noon"" and that his friends were begging him to get help. It also claimed that his alleged alcohol addiction is what destroyed his marriage to Lambert.  In response to the story, Shelton sued the magazine, and though he admitted to posting about drinking and alcohol on social media he denied the claims that he was a ""raging alcoholic.""  Among the claims he said were false include ones that he had started drinking when he was 14, as a way to cope with his brother's death. Richie Shelton died in a car accident when he was 24 and Shelton was just 14.  He also denied he magazine's claims that he went to rehab, and said the fake story was built on ""friend-of-friend gossip"" and a guy who believes he can ""spot alcoholism.""  “It’s simply a case of Blake having supersized this persona of him having fun and drinking,” says a source close to Shelton to People of the claims.  ""My tweets are intended to amuse and get a reaction from my fans,"" he explains. ""They are exaggerated figments of my imagination, and from the reactions I get, I think my fans understand that,"" Shelton said in the lawsuit.  Happy Independence Day everybody!!!!! I’m proud to be an American!!! Aaaannnd I’m drinking to celebrate... — Blake Shelton (@blakeshelton) July 4, 2018  In 2017, Radar Online reported that Shelton's current girlfriend Gwen Stefani told him that she wasn't walking down the aisle until he stopped drinking.  According to an insider, he lost 85 pounds that year thanks to Stefani putting him on a no-drinking diet. However, during that time he was also seen leaving a liquor store in L.A. with multiple boxes of tequila.  “When Gwen is away, Blake seems to play! Or, at the very least, take a few cheat days,” a source said.  Emily Blackwood is an editor at YourTango who covers pop culture, dating, relationships and everything in between.

Proving that his hard work is paying off, the actor regularly tackles ninja warrior courses, jumping from rope to rope, lifting tyres and completing non-stop pull-ups on the beaches of California, in addition to hours spent in the gym each day.  Zac Efron may have been blessed with undeniably good genetics, but make no mistake: The lean physique he showcases in Baywatch has been earned.  The average preparation time for Hollywood training usually lands somewhere around four to six weeks, but Efron started the work eight months before the cameras were on.  “I have been training actors for 20 years and I have never seen anything quite like his work ethic,” says Efron’s trainer Patrick Murphy. “He was crushing two sessions a day, doing lifeguard courses, and then going on 20-mile bike rides. There is a laser focus he has about his training. On top of that, I never once heard him groan about doing another rep.”  “Patrick’s training was confusing at first,” Efron says. “He pushed me to my limits with a very multifaceted style: strength, explosiveness, fast-paced, calculated, diverse, and gut-wrenching workouts. It was fun … you never know what he’s going to throw at you the next day.”  In terms of nutrition, he follows a strict diet, including several nine day detox cures in which sugar and carbohydrates are off limits, to be replaced by as many organic vegetables and lean proteins as he likes. 12 weeks of training later, the result is a sharply toned silhouette with rock hard abs and pecs and little over 5% body fat – the average is somewhere between 15% and 30%.  A quick glimpse into the life of a fitness fanatic, via his Instagram.  ?⚪️? #teamnosleep A post shared by Zac Efron (@zacefron) on Jul 4, 2016 at 10:25pm PDT  The last lifeguard is wrapped 😉 #Baywatch A post shared by Zac Efron (@zacefron) on May 21, 2016 at 7:51am PDT  Post filming chest/tri's.

"Are Matt Damon and Ben Affleck letting a woman come between them? It sure looks that way! Sources exclusively told In Touch that the longtime pals are no longer close because Matt isn't too fond of Ben's girlfriend, Lindsay Shookus. ""[Matt] thinks she is controlling and manipulative,"" the insider claimed.  Aside from her less redeeming qualities, Matt also believes Lindsay is ""bad news"" for Ben. ""She likes to drink and Ben [who recently went to rehab] shouldn't be around that,"" the source said.  (Photo Credit: Getty Images)  Although it's unclear when Ben and Lindsay actually started seeing each other, a source told Entertainment Tonight that things got romantic after his separation from wife, Jennifer Garner. Since then, the pair have taken their relationship public as they've been spotted going on dinner dates and grabbing coffee. Rumors even swirled that Ben introduced Lindsay to his three kids — Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6.  But as close as Lindsay and Ben are getting, Matt still isn't convinced she's the right girl for him. ""Matt doesn’t think she measures up to Jennifer [Garner],"" the source revealed. ""Matt's bummed. He hopes Ben eventually comes to his senses.""  (Photo Credit: Getty Images)  Ben and Matt — whose careers both kicked off after their roles in Good Will Hunting — have been friends for more than two decades, so it's safe to say they know each other pretty well. Matt even stuck up for Ben when he was asked about the dad of three's insanely large back tattoo. ""It’s not one man’s job to tell another man what he can do to his back,"" Matt told The Daily Show With Trevor Noah. ""I support him in all of his artistic expression.""  But Lindsay is no artistic expression, and Matt ""can't stand"" her. Only time will tell if these friends with so much history can make it work despite the bad blood.

Rumors about trouble in David and Victoria’s marriage have been proliferating in the tabloids since the Royal Wedding, where the couple was photographed looking dour. Of course, there are always rumors about the Beckhams, who will (hopefully?) celebrate their 19th wedding anniversary on July 4. This time, though, social-media participants seem convinced that they are really heading for a split.  There are a few factors to consider when weighing the possibility of divorce. One is: Do you care? Another is: What have the Beckhams said about their marriage? (It’s F-I-N-E, according to their publicist, who called the rumors “Journalist Chinese whispers and fake news fueled by social media.”) And another is: What’s going on with the Beckhams’ businesses?  Last week, the Daily Mail reported that David left his longtime manager, who also manages Posh, for a new team led by his friend David Gardner. This, to me, would be the strongest sign of an impending split, but the Beckhams quickly denied the report. Then, Victoria gave a speech at the Forbes Women Summit in New York, where she mentioned David specifically and called him an “incredible husband.”  “I try really, really hard. I try hardest to be the best mother,” she said in her speech, according to People. “I am trying to be the best wife and the best professional. When I get home I try to put the phone down and spend time with the children and spend time with David. I have the support of an incredible husband. We really are equal with everything we do at home with the children. When I’m away he’s the one doing the school run and doing the cooking.”  So Victoria is trying. Is David? So far, he hasn’t personally said anything about the divorce rumors. I’d wait to see what he does next week for their anniversary.  In other celebrity relationship news, Ben Affleck and Lindsay Shookus are doing great. Shookus’s parents visited the couple in L.A. this past weekend, and they all went on a dinner date and a hike the next day. (Shookus’s 5-year-old daughter was present for the hike, too.) According to an “eyewitness” who talked to People, Affleck was in a “great mood” at dinner, and he “picked up the check at the end of the night.”  Photo: Juliano-rol/X17online.com  But Affleck and Shookus are not necessarily getting more serious, according to Entertainment Tonight. A source close to Affleck told the outlet, “Ben knows he loves Lindsay, but he wants to take things slow for the sake of his sobriety. He’s actually been told to take it slow and he’s heeding that advice … Ben isn’t ready to propose and has no plans to get engaged anytime soon, but Lindsay feels he is worth the wait.”  What do you think? Is Ben Affleck worth the wait?  Moving more quickly is Shookus’s SNL colleague Pete Davidson, who just moved into a $16 million apartment in Manhattan with his new fiancé, Ariana Grande. Grande’s 25th birthday is today, and Davidson wished her a happy birthday on Instagram just after midnight.  Last night, Grande posted a photo of Davidson on her Instagram story at 11:11 p.m. with the caption, “i have no wish i have everything i ever wanted hi.” I love it!  Do you remember who Chris Martin is dating? It’s Dakota Johnson. They were photographed walking a dog in Malibu on Sunday.

Selena Gomez is making a list, and she’s checking it twice to find out what kind of guy she likes! She’s determined to find the ‘perfect bf’ and we’ve got the list of qualities she’s looking for and the deal breakers!  For Selena Gomez, her relationship with Justin Bieber, 24, taught her everything not to do. And now that things between them are officially over for good, Selena is getting serious about narrowing down what she wants in a guy. “Selena made a list of qualities she is looking for in her next man and also a list of deal breakers too. After breaking up with Justin for the last time, she has done a lot of thinking about what would make a perfect boyfriend and she came up with a simple list,” a source close to the “Wolves” singer tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY.  “She wants someone smart, funny and obviously cute too. Someone in the industry likely, who is successful and understanding of her busy schedule would be preferable, but he doesn’t have to be famous,” the insider continued Her packed scheduled was seemingly one of the reasons she and JB couldn’t make it work. “Selena also has a few qualities that she will not tolerate at all, total deal breakers. If a guy’s Instagram is full of selfies, that is a no-go, and she wants a guy with integrity that she can trust completely,” our source added. She’s definitely not asking for too much!  “If she can’t communicate or believe her man, or a guy who gets mysterious text messages at odd hours– that would be a total deal breaker for her,” the source said. “Other than that, she is trying to keep an open mind about her next boyfriend. She is quick to fall in love with artist and singers who inspire her and help her own creativity,” the source explained seemingly in reference to Selena’s other ex-boyfriend The Weeknd. “She is absolutely ready for love again and feels like her next boyfriend just might be another talented guy like many of her exes,” the source added. Well, we’re rooting for you Sel!	0

"Fans were heartbroken on Sunday when John Cena and Nikki Bella announced their breakup after six years together.  The pro wrestling couple revealed they were splitting and calling off their wedding in a social media statement. ET has learned that the two were just three weeks away from tying the knot on May 5.  “After much contemplation and 6 years of being together Nikki Bella and John Cena announced today their decision to separate as a couple,” the statement read on Bella's Instagram account. “While this decision was a difficult one, we continue to have a great deal of love and respect for one another. We ask that you respect our privacy during this time in our lives.”  Cena, 40, and Bella, 34, got engaged last April after the pair won the mixed tag team match at WrestleMania 33 in Orlando, Florida.  ""I have been waiting so long to ask you this,"" Cena told Bella during the emotional moment, presenting her with a huge diamond ring. ""Stephanie Nicole Garcia-Colace, will you marry me?""  Though throughout their relationship, there have been signs that the two were dealing with serious issues regarding their future together. Read on for a few of those moments before their breakup.  1. Cena has repeatedly said he never wanted to get married again or have kids.  Cena was previously married to his high school sweetheart, Elizabeth Huberdeau, though they divorced in 2012 after marrying in 2009. Since then, the wrestler had been vocal about not wanting to tie the knot again. In an episode of Bella's E! reality show with her sister Brie Bella, Total Bellas, he revealed that he had Bella sign a 75-page agreement before they could even move in together.  In a 2013 episode of Total Bellas, Bella told Cena that she wanted to be a mother, but he bluntly told her that he didn't want to have children.  “I’m going to choose my words carefully,” Cena replied. “I can’t give you that.”  In 2014, he reiterated the point during yet another episode.  “I’ve told you I don’t want to get married and I don’t want to have kids, and you do want to get married and you do want to have kids,"" he said. ""I feel like there’s a time bomb over my head.”  In an interview with Rolling Stone in 2016, Cena revealed that he and Bella have been in therapy over the issue.  ""Look, I know I cannot handle raising a child,"" he told the magazine. ""It's like with the dog. My biggest thing to Nicole about the dog was: Love dogs, but I can't contribute to taking care of one. I don't have the time. And just because everyone else is happy with children doesn't mean that's how I have to live.""  ""I've been upfront about this,"" he continued. ""I just have things I need to get done. It's not negotiable. We've been to therapy over it. I don't think it will ever be over with. I'm stubborn as f**k and extremely selfish as well. I don't want kids, I don't want marriage. That's me just saying, 'Hey, this is my life and this is how I'm going to live.'""    2. The couple has wanted to call off their wedding before.  During a season three episode of Total Bellas, the couple got into a pretty serious disagreement.  ""So we really want to call this off?"" a distraught Bella asked Cena, as the two talked about their future together.  Cena later said during his appearance on the Today show that he was the one who ""caved"" when it came to working out the argument.  “I can generalize it in saying in relationships you have points of disagreement and it was a point of disagreement where it seemed like we couldn’t get past it,” he explained to Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford. “We got past it, and we’re back on.”  In March, Cena opened up to ET at the 2018 Kids' Choice Awards about their relationship struggles that have played out on Total Bellas.  ""It's a weird thing that our relationship is public for the world to know, [but] what a good takeaway for the folks at home -- relationships are tough,"" Cena said. ""It's hard work, and a lot of times, it has to do with looking at yourself.""  ""'OK, there's a pr"	1
"Ben Higgins fights 'fake news' of split with Lauren Bushnell with romantic Instagram  Ben Higgins has not reverted to being a Bachelor. The object of several contestants' affection on the ABC dating show has taken to Instagram to debunk rumors that he and Lauren Bushnell have called it quits.  The Coloradan shared an image Wednesday that was taken shortly before the pair was engaged in Jamaica. In the sweet photograph, Lauren's eyes are blissfully closed as she revels in Ben's embrace.  Though Ben doesn't feel the need to address the untruths, he assured his 1.5 million followers that his feelings for Lauren have not diminished.  ""We have entered into a world where rumors will exist we know that,"" he wrote, ""but just know as @laurenbushnell celebrates her birthday tomorrow I am still extremely lucky to be able to share life with her and be by her side.""  As of Thursday morning, the birthday girl had not responded to rumors of a break-up, probably because she was too busy posting envy-inducing photos from the Four Seasons Resort Punta Mita in Mexico.  While Ben was not pictured, about a week ago the two enjoyed a basketball game at Denver's Pepsi Center. They look cozy, don't you think?  It might be easy for some to believe the rumors since the couple had a tumultuous journey during season one of their reality show, Ben & Lauren: Happily Ever After? Ben called their plans to have a televised wedding off because he didn't want to ""rush it,"" only to announce the wedding was back on in the show's season finale.  For, now this couple is still in the running to be a Bachelor success story."	0
"March 2017: Jenner ended her long-term relationship with Tyga.  While the couple didn't confirm their relationship until August 2015, most people assume that the couple began dating a year prior. Craig Barritt/Getty Images  Rumors began to swirl when fans realized Tyga had not made an appearance on Jenner's social media since Valentine's Day of that year. An anonymous source told HollywoodLife that Jenner had dumped the pseudo-rapper because she was ""bored"" with the ""dead end"" relationship.  Later in the month, Tyga's ex-fianceé Blac Chyna heavily suggested in a Snapchat rant that he had been cheating on Jenner, as reported by Cosmopolitan.  ""Multiple sources"" confirmed the split to People in early April. At the time, these sources framed the break-up as a brief separation — which seemed consistent with the couple's on-and-off relationship.  ""They tend to take little breaks all the time and then get back together,"" says one insider. ""It's definitely possible they'll work things out again.""  Jenner later opened up about the split on an episode of ""Life of Kylie,"" stating that the two will ""always have a bond.""  ""There was absolutely nothing wrong with me and T,"" she revealed. ""There was no crazy fight. We decided — well, I decided — that I'm really young. I don't want to look back in five years from now and feel like he took something from me, when he's really not that type of person."""	0

"Jennifer Lopez took the Billboard Latin Music Awards by surprise on Thursday night (April 26) with her live debut of the brand-new song ""El Anillo."" The song's lyrics are sexy and provocative, with lyrics like ""Me tratas como una princesa y me das lo que pido. Tu tienes el bate y la fuerza que yo necesito"" -- which translates to ""You treat me like a princess and give me what I ask. You have the bat and the strength I need,"" teasing her relationship with boyfriend and baseball legend Alex Rodriguez.  After sharing the song's cover art on Instagram earlier Thursday, this is the first time J.Lo has released new music since her collaboration on the Skrillex and Poo Bear-produced track ""Us,"" which dropped in February, and it's her first Spanish-language single of the year.  The performance showcased Lopez's versatile style, with Bohemian-inspired vibes mixed with a touch of urban. She incorporated several dancers and finished off by asking, ""El anillo pa cuando?"" translating to ""When is the ring coming?""  Watch her performance below."	1
"Kourtney Kardashian. Picture: Instagram ( @kourtneykardash)  Kris Jenner’s alleged online stalker has been accused of hacking her daughter Kourtney Kardashian. In 2016, a woman named Christina Elizabeth Bankston was accused of cyberstalking the 62-year-old reality star and hacking her iCloud account two years earlier, where she allegedly sent threatening messages to her, her former spouse Caitlyn Jenner, two unnamed family members and two assistants.  Bankston’s public defenders have now filed a motion to have eight of the 15 counts against her dismissed, and according to E! News, the motion includes fresh accusations against Bankson, alleging that also in 2014, she obtained the username, password and security answers for Kris’ daughter Kourtney's AOL account and gained access to her emails.  It is unknown at the time of writing if Kourtney, 38, is one of the two unnamed family members from the 2016 filing, or if the accusations are completely new.  Bankston’s motion filing comes as her defence says she has the right to be prosecuted where the alleged crimes took place, rather than in California, where the ‘Keeping Up with the Kardashians’ stars live.  The documents state: ""The Constitution and the federal rules of criminal procedure protect [Bankston’s] right to be prosecuted in the federal judicial district where the alleged crimes occurred, rather than in a district convenient to the government or its celebrity complaining witnesses.”"	1
"Taylor Lautner says goodbye to his beloved pet.  The 26-year-old Scream Queens star shared an emotional post on Friday, mourning the death of his dog, Roxy. Alongside a picture of Lautner holding up his pup and kissing her on the face, the actor recalled when his parents first gave him Roxy.  ""Roxy, my family surprised me with you on the set of Sharkboy and Lavagirl in 2004,"" he began his message. ""You have brought so much joy into my life for the past 13 1/2 years. I’ll miss you every day but I’ll take those memories with me everywhere I go. I love you.""  According to Taylor's sister, Makena, who also shared her own personal Instagram post, Roxy died one week ago.  Lautner isn't the only celeb who's recently lost a pet. Molly Sims' 18-year-old dog, Poupette, died earlier this month. Chelsea Handler and Christina Aguilera also paid tributes to their beloved dogs in January.  Meanwhile, Khloe Kardashian also grieved the loss of her canine, Gabbana. The reality star's boyfriend, Tristan Thompson, sent her a stunning floral arrangement that was in a shape of a giant paw print to honor Kardashian's late pet.

Advertisement  YouTube/  Advertisement  Things got a little awkward when married couple Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban stopped by the UK talk show The Graham Norton Show on Friday (May 19).  Kidman was on the show promoting her movie The Beguiled, which she co-stars with Kirsten Dunst, Elle Fanning, and Colin Farrell. In it, she has to give Farrell’s character a sponge bath, which Kidman admitted, “took about a day” to film.  When Norton asked if filming the sponge bath scenes were awkward, she referred to another upcoming movie she co-stars with Farrell, called The Killing Of A Sacred Deer.  “Considering what Colin and I did in ‘The Killing Of A Sacred Deer’, that was nothing,” she told Norton. They play husband and wife that are described as a troubled couple, but their “sex life is good, if a little kinky,” according to Variety.  But, according to E! News, she quickly said, “Can we move on? My husband is on the show!“  We don’t blame her for wanting the change the subject so fast! Norton switched gears by asking Kidman about her upcoming birthday, in which she turns 50! Urban talks about what he has planned and what he did for her 40th in the clip below.  Now On Spotify!

Michael agreed to participate in the show in hopes to promote his business, and because he thought it would spotlight their happy marriage. Veronika officially filed for divorce in 2016. Michael filed a lawsuit against the network in January 2016. The lawsuit states ""The series was nothing about the couple's happy marriage."" Obeng claimed that he was required to display an ""unrealistic and manufactured personality"" which could harm his business if the show is allowed to air. In a letter from his lawyer which was sent to E! Entertainment in August 2016, Obeng demanded that his children not to be included in the show. The letter identified the show under a new name Famously Married. Obeng is suing NBCUniversal the parent company of the E! Network. The suit seeks an injunction barring the network from airing or promoting the episode in which Obeng appears.[11]"	1
"ABC  WARNING: THE OWLS ARE NOT WHAT THEY SEEM, BUT THE SPOILERS BELOW ARE!  ""Twin Peaks"" ostensibly was a murder mystery about a homecoming queen named Laura Palmer. Her sad story was entangled with secrets kept by her best friend, family, classmates, lovers and psychiatrist. But there was always more to it than just Laura's troubled life.  When FBI Agent Dale Cooper came to investigate her death, he found an impressive array of suspects, ranging from drug-dealing trucker Leo to a possessed one-armed man. There was the eccentric Log Lady, as well as an extra-dimensional evil place called the Black Lodge, a dancing backward-talking dwarf, owls that weren't owls, a creepy entity named Bob and endless doughnuts, cherry pies and really good coffee. In short, ""Twin Peaks"" was like no procedural we'd ever seen.  When Laura's creepy doppelganger in the red-draped Black Lodge told Agent Cooper ""I'll see you again in 25 years,"" we got chills. Now that time has come.  With the ""Twin Peaks"" revival (18 hours in all) set to debut on Showtime with a two-hour premiere Sunday, fans have just a few days left to look back and gather clues about what's in store for Agent Cooper and the quirky citizens of the Pacific Northwest town. (Disclosure: Showtime is owned by CNET parent company CBS.)  The original ""Twin Peaks"" lasted two seasons, a total of 30 episodes, on ABC from 1990 to 1991 and was followed by the 1992 prequel film ""Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me.""  A few books added to the lore. ""The Secret Diary of Laura Palmer"" was a 1990 spinoff novel written by Lynch's daughter Jennifer Lynch. ""Twin Peaks: An Access Guide to the Town"" by David Lynch included everything from Norma Jenning's cherry pie recipe to the type of tree the Log Lady's log came from. And most recently, in 2016, ""Twin Peaks"" co-creator Mark Frost penned ""The Secret History of Twin Peaks,"" which would set the scene for the new series.  Because it's easy to get lost for weeks, if not years, obsessing over ""Twin Peaks,"" here's a handy guide to highlights from the original TV series, the prequel movie (with deleted scenes) and books that might be important to the upcoming series on Showtime. Keep in mind this is only a tiny sample of what happens to the characters.  TV series  Original ""Twin Peaks""  Season 1:  (Suggested episodes worth rewatching -- the pilot, 3, 8)  High school student Laura Palmer (Sheryl Lee) is found dead, naked and wrapped in a plastic sheet by the edge of a lake.  FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper (Kyle MacLachlan) comes to Twin Peaks to investigate the murder. He often leaves recorded messages on a mini cassette recorder for Diane, his secretary back at FBI headquarters in DC.  Laura's best friend Donna (Lara Flynn Boyle) and her secret boyfriend James Hurley (James Marshall) decide to investigate Laura's murder on their own.  Laura's actual boyfriend Bobby Briggs (Dana Ashbrook) is having a secret affair with Double R Diner waitress Shelly Johnson (Mädchen Amick), unbeknownst to her abusive husband Leo Johnson (Eric DaRe).  Suspects include Bobby Briggs, Bobby's pal Mike Nelson (Gary Hershberger), Laura's psychiatrist Dr. Lawrence Jacoby (Russ Tamblyn), Leo Johnson, James Hurley, One-Eyed Jacks casino employee Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz) and The One-Armed Man Phillip Michael Gerard (played by Al Strobel), who's possessed by an entity named Mike.  Agent Cooper has a series of bizarre dreams that take place in the ""Red Room"" in the Black Lodge. Laura's doppelgänger is there along with a dancing dwarf referred to as The Man from Another Place played by Michael J. Anderson.  Laura's mother Sarah Palmer (Grace Zabriskie) has a horrifying vision of Bob hiding behind Laura's bed.  Agent Cooper is shot by an unknown assailant in his hotel room.  Dr. Jacoby is assaulted by a masked man.  Jacques Renault is smothered to death by Laura's dad Leland.  There's still no answer to who killed Laura Palmer.

"She may be half his age, but it looks like she's all-in on this relationship.  At age 34, Katharine McPhee is engaged to her boyfriend, 68-year-old David Foster.  A rep for the former “American Idol” star confirmed the engagement with Fox News Wednesday.  TMZ reported the celebrated music producer popped the question during their European vacation.  While it’s unknown which day he proposed, the celebrity gossip site claimed McPhee was flaunting her engagement ring while on the Italian island of Capri Sunday. She was also allegedly showing off her rock to family and friends on FaceTime.  This will be McPhee’s second marriage and Foster’s fifth. The music mogul was previously married to B.J. Cook, Rebecca Dyer, Linda Thompson and Yolanda Hadid.  The couple first sparked dating rumors in May 2017, but wouldn’t confirm their relationship until late last year.  In October, Foster’s 35-year-old daughter Erin praised McPhee to People Magazine.  “She’s amazing,” gushed Erin at the time. “I really like her. She’s awesome. My dad is kind of a hopeless romantic, and Katherine’s awesome. We really, really like her, and we’ve known her for a really long time. And if he’s happy, we’re happy.”  And McPhee hasn't been shy about praising her beau.  “… I just pinch myself when I get to spend time with him on a personal level,” McPhee told Entertainment Tonight in September. “I love his outlook on life and how he treats people. He’s really a special person in my life.  ""What I’ve learned from him is how lucky we are to do what we do. He’s always reminding me and it’s comforting to know that it’s people to walk through this life he’s had – working with incredible people, being friends with ex-presidents and world leaders – and still have that perspective. He’s so well-connected, but still just a simple guy from Canada with his little Canadian accent!”  McPhee also told Health magazine in December she has known Foster for years. The couple previously collaborated for a few live performances, including his 2008 PBS tribute concert “Hit Man: David Foster & Friends.”  “We’re very close friends, and we’ve been friends for a long time,” said the “American Idol” Season 5 runner-up. “I’m really, really fond of him, and I think he’s an incredible person. I’ve known him since I was 21 years old, you know? He produced my first single. So he’s been really good to me. People can say whatever they want.”"	0
"Both Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have moved on in their professional lives since they got separated last year but rumours about their personal lives keep swirling on the internet. A recent report claims that the A-list Hollywood actress is upset about the thought of her estranged husband dating another woman and keeps track of him through their common friends.  ""Angelina's hyper-aware of what Brad's up to, she's always trying to keep tabs on him. They still have friends in common and she quizzes them for info. She knows Brad's ready to start dating again,"" a source told Hollywood Life.  The report by the entertainment website claims that the 42-year-old Salt actress ""hates the idea"" of Pitt moving on in his life ""emotionally"". ""It's a hard pill for her to swallow and that's got her wanting to do the same. She's very competitive and hates the idea of him beating her to the punch. Plus it drives her crazy that he's emotionally moved on since she really hasn't.""  The actress is currently focussing on her family and was often spotted going out with her six children. Pitt, on the other hand, is having a busy filming schedule and is reportedly ready to date again. Recently, he has been linked with Ella Purnell, a British actress who is 32 years younger than him.  ""Right now Angelina's still not started dating but she has been getting closer to pulling the trigger. Hearing Brad is looking to date again made her feel motivated to find someone too. Even though her mind really isn't in that space she hates the idea of 'losing' to him. She's started forcing herself to open her eyes and look around and a few guys have caught her eye,"" the Hollywood Life source claimed."	0

Khloe’s Latest Rumored Rival For Tristan Thompson’s Love Is Much Closer To Home  There’s been all kinds of rumors about trouble in Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson’s relationship but this may be the ugliest one yet.  A new report claims that Kylie Jenner has been thirsty dancing for Tristan’s attention.  “She’s been texting him sexy selfies and flirting non-stop when Khloe’s back is turned,” an insider exclusively told RadarOnline.com.“Kylie gets a huge kick out of it and can’t help herself.” This isn’t the first time Jenner, 19, has gone after one of her sister’s love interests. The insider points out that in the past she’s managed to grow cozy with Kendall’s guys, Kourtney’s ex, Scott Disick, and Kim’s husband, Kanye West.  We’ve heard some pretty skanky stories about Kylie that have included some of her sister’s exes, but the new reports say that this time around Kylie’s really got it bad.  “She’s got it bad for Tristan and has even told friends that he’s way too hot for Khloe,” said the insider. “If he made a move on her she’d totally go there,” warned the source, adding the situation could become explosive quite quickly, especially since Kardashian, 32, and Thompson’s relationship has hit some major speed bumps.  To make matters even worse, Tristan’s not exactly known for being Mr. Fidelity  “Tristan dumped his pregnant girlfriend for Khloe, so it’s certainly in his nature to cheat.”  Seems like a pretty unlikely story but then again we never thought Blac Chyna and Rob would be a thing. Nobody is off limits in this family riiiight?  Hit the flip for the latest scantily clad pics of Kylie.  WENN	0

You know, just the whole bridal shower, the party, the dress. I can say that I didn’t anticipate being engaged right now. It came as a surprise.

Not so fast. Despite reports, a source tells Us Weekly that Angelina Jolie is not off the market.  “Angie isn’t dating a real estate agent. She isn’t even dating at the moment,” the insider reveals. “Yes, she has hung out with a couple of guys over the last year, but it’s extremely low-key.”  The Salt actress, 42, and estranged husband Brad Pitt officially called it quits in September 2016 after more than 10 years together and two years of marriage. They are parents to Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 9.  “The divorce talks between Brad and Angie are ongoing,” the source adds, noting that Pitt, 54, is lonesome for their children, who live with their mom. “Brad wishes the kids would spend overnights at his house, but he is hopeful that over time, that will organically happen.”  The Tomb Raider star and Pitt much of their marriage on the move, raising their family in various cities. But since their split, Jolie and the kids have remained in L.A. “Angie is frustrated that Los Angeles has become the home base for the family,” the source says. “Yes, she does travel, but she misses the nomadic lifestyle of moving around every three or four months. It’s best for the kids that they aren’t moving around all the time. Angie has a restless spirit and would have continued to roam around the world with the kids if the divorce hadn’t occurred. Brad insisted that the kids have stability and wanted them to stop moving around.”  Jolie opened up about raising her kids as a single mother in a September 2017 interview with the Sunday Telegraph. “It’s been difficult. I don’t enjoy being single,” the First They Killed My Father director admitted. “It’s not something I wanted. There’s nothing nice about it. It’s just hard.”  Although Jolie puts on a brave face for the cameras, she quietly battles her emotions. “Sometimes maybe it appears I am pulling it together, but really, I am just trying to get through my days,” she disclosed. “Emotionally, it’s been a very difficult year.”	0
"Image copyright Getty Images Image caption Harvey Weinstein, 66, has denied non-consensual sex  Hollywood has been rocked by allegations against film mogul Harvey Weinstein - which first came to light in a New York Times article.  Since then, the story has developed continuously, with a large number of women coming forward to say they were sexually harassed or assaulted by Weinstein - allegations he has denied.  Here is a summary of the events so far:  5 October 2017  The New York Times publishes a story detailing decades of allegations of sexual harassment against Harvey Weinstein. Actresses Rose McGowan and Ashley Judd are among the women who come forward.  Among the accusations are that he forced women to massage him and watch him naked. He also promised to help advance their careers in return for sexual favours.  Weinstein issues an apology acknowledging he ""has caused a lot of pain"" - but disputes allegations he harassed female employees over nearly three decades.  Weinstein's lawyer tells The Hollywood Reporter his client is preparing to sue the New York Times.  Weinstein says he is taking a ""leave of absence"" from The Weinstein Company and is working with a therapist.  6 October 2017  Brie Larson and Lena Dunham are among those to react to the allegations in the article, praising the bravery of those who have come forward.  The Weinstein Company says it takes the allegations ""extremely seriously"" and is launching an inquiry.  7 October 2017  Weinstein's lawyer Lisa Bloom announces her resignation, saying she understands that ""Mr Weinstein and his board are moving toward an agreement"".  8 October 2017  It is announced that Harvey Weinstein has been sacked by the board of his company, with immediate effect.  They say the decision was made ""in light of new information about misconduct"".  9 October 2017  10 October 2017  Allegations from 13 more women are published in the New Yorker magazine, including three accusations of rape, which Weinstein strongly denies.  Actress Asia Argento and a former aspiring actress named Lucia Stoller say Weinstein forced himself on them sexually. A third woman withholds her name from the article, the result of a 10-month investigation by the magazine. Argento says the incident happened in 1997 in the south of France while Stoller, who now goes under the name Evans, says she was forced into a sexual act by the producer after going for a casting meeting in 2004.  Mira Sorvino, who starred in several of Weinstein's films, told the New Yorker that Weinstein sexually harassed her and tried to pressure her into a physical relationship.  Weinstein's spokeswoman Sallie Hofmeister tells the publication: ""Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr Weinstein.""  Hollywood A-listers Gwyneth Paltrow and Angelina Jolie say they were harassed by Weinstein. Paltrow says she was propositioned as a 22-year-old, while Jolie refers to a ""bad experience"" in her youth.  Other figures to speak out against Weinstein include Barack Obama, Benedict Cumberbatch and Leonardo DiCaprio.  Weinstein's wife Georgina Chapman announces she is leaving him and that her priority is her young children.  11 October 2017  Bafta says it is suspending Weinstein's membership, with immediate effect.  A number of senior Labour MPs call for Weinstein's honorary CBE to be taken away. Prime Minister Theresa May says a decision about the honour would not lie with Downing Street.  Cara Delevingne also says Weinstein made advances towards her.  A statement from the Cannes Film Festival says organisers are ""dismayed"" to learn of the allegations about Weinstein.  12 October 2017  Overnight, police are called following a ""family dispute"" at the home of Weinstein's daughter. The Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) confirms they were called to reports of a ""disturbance"" at the house but say no crime was committed. Weinstein was not there when officers arrived.  Police in New York tell the BBC they are looking to speak to a"	1
"One of the most popular CW superhero shows, The Flash has a winning mixture of a likeable lead, fun premise and fast-paced (see what we did there?) action.  With a large and passionate fanbase, we expect this show to run and run (oooh, we did it again!) – with a season 5 already confirmed. Here's everything we know about the next batch of episodes involving everyone's favourite DC TV speedster.  The Flash season 5 release date: When's it coming?  The Flash was renewed alongside its fellow ArrowVerse series in April 2018, with a premiere date for the fifth season being confirmed in June.  New episodes will air on The CW in the US from Tuesday, October 9 at 8/7c, followed by new episodes of Black Lightning.  In the UK, Sky One is expected to follow its regular pattern of airing The Flash a few weeks after episodes air Stateside.  The Flash season 5 cast: Who'll be in it?  The CW  The following Flash favourites will all return as series regulars:  - Grant Gustin as Barry Allen / The Flash  - Candice Patton as Iris West  - Danielle Panabaker as Caitlin Snow  - Carlos Valdes as Cisco Ramon / Vibe  - Jesse L. Martin as Joe West  Tom Cavanagh will also be back... in a new form.  It's become a tradition on The Flash that each new season introduces us to a new batch of weird and wonderful takes on Harrison Wells, all played by the incomparable Cavanagh.  The first and most prominent will be the Holmes-inspired 'Sherloque' Wells, but we can expect some more variations as the episodes unfold.  After previously recurring on the show, Danielle Nicolet (Cecile Horton), Hartley Sawyer (Ralph Dibny / Elongated Man) and Jessica Parker Kennedy (Nora West-Allen) have also been promoted to the main cast for season 5.  The CW  It's not all good news, though: having previously transferred to spin-off Legends of Tomorrow, Keiynan Lonsdale later announced that he wouldn't be returning to either that show or The Flash as a regular this fall.  In a social post, Lonsdale later explained that now was ""the right time to continue [his] journey on an unknown path"" but insisted that his exit was not ""a total goodbye"" from the Arrow-Verse.  Wally will appear in season 5's premiere and is ""in three episodes this season"" - as confirmed by The Flash showrunner Todd Helbing. (No word yet on if they'll be three consecutive episodes, or if Kid Flash will pop up sporadically throughout.)  ""We have not as much time with Kid Flash as I think everybody would like to see,"" Helbing said. But the story we have for him is really cool, so I hope everybody likes it.""  Meanwhile, Chris Klein — best known for playing Oz in the American Piemovies — will be shedding his nice guy persona for a considerably darker turn as the Big Bad in the new season of the DC TV series.  Gabriel Olsen/Getty Images  Klein will be playing Cicada – not be a cult leader as in the comics, the character has been described as a ""grizzled, blue-collar everyman"" who seeks to eliminate metahumans one-by-one to settle a family grudge.  Guest / recurring cast this year will include: KIana Madeira as a gender-swapped version of the comic book villain Spin, and America's Got Talent contestant Troy James as metahuman contortionist Peter Merkel (aka Rag Doll)...  Kyle Secor (who you may recognise from Veronica Mars or The Purge: Election Year) has also been cast as the elusive Dr. Thomas Snow — father to Caitlin. We predict one more awkward daddy / daughter reunion...  Alongside Secor, Susan Walters will also be reprising her role as Caitlin's mother Dr. Carol Tannhauser.  The Flash season 5 plot: What will it be about?  The CW  The last season of The Flash closed with the reveal of Mystery Girl's identity (she's Nora West-Allen, Barry and Iris's daughter from the future!) and the next will explore the immediate ramifications, picking up – according to Helbing – ""right where we left off"".  The theme for this season is ""legacy"". That's according to Helbing, who elaborates, ""It's [about] what's really important t"	1
"Like many people who live life in the public eye, Anne Hathaway is no stranger to internet hate. Now, the actress is taking preemptive action against haters and trolls as she bulks up in preparation for an upcoming film role.  ""I am gaining weight for a movie role and it is going well,"" Hathaway captioned a video highlighting her impressive (and tiring) new exercise routine. ""To all the people who are going to fat shame me in the upcoming months, it’s not me, it’s you.""  The video is sped up and shows what appears to be a very long and grueling workout, which Hathaway takes like a champ.  ""I wanted to set this to Queen’s 'Fat Bottomed Girls' but copyright said no. Continued peace,"" she added at the end of her caption.  Hathaway didn't specify which film she is gaining weight for, but her reported upcoming projects include the sci-fi thriller O2, an adaptation of the Joan Didion novel The Last Thing He Wanted, and a remake of Dirty Rotten Scoundrels with Rebel Wilson."	1
    If you always wanted to go shoe shopping with Sarah Jessica Parker (and who doesn’t?), you’re out of luck. The Sex & the City star launched a shopping excursion with Airbnb on Monday, September 25, and it already sold out in just two hours.  The $400 price tag for the “Sole in the City with SJP” experience scores you a chance to have the shoe designer help you handpick a pair of shoes from her SJP Collection at Bloomingdale’s, a post-shopping snack of fro yo and a ticket to the New York City Ballet show, along with facetime with SJP herself.  “What better way to meet than at Bloomingdale’s 59th Street, an iconic NYC landmark, for what I hope is an unforgettable shoe-shopping experience,” Parker, 52, explains on the Airbnb site. “I’ll help you find the perfect pair of shoes from the SJP Collection to complete your look. As we peruse the shoe department, I’ll tell you about the line and how the city that never sleeps helped inspire it. Next we’ll head to Forty Carrots for what some may say is the best frozen yogurt in NYC and we’ll chat about my city and why I’ve called it home for so many years. After that, I’ll send you off in your new SJP shoes to a special evening at the exquisite and incomparable New York City Ballet. You’ll have some of the best seats in the house, plus some VIP surprises. It’ll be a night you won’t soon forget.”  Considering a pair of her shoes retail for between $295-$545 alone, this is actually a great deal! The bad news is there were only four spots available and they’re already booked. The good news that all proceeds from the experience go to help fund the New York City Ballet.  Going shoe shopping with a celebrity while giving back to the arts is something Stylish can totally get behind. Fingers crossed SJP does more of these in the future!	1
thestir.cafemom.com / Thursday, 5 April 2018 04:54:34  She's definitely selective about the types of photos she chooses to share on Instagram, especially when it comes to pictures of her family. And that's why we couldn't help but be a little excited over Kim Kardashian's new family photo with all three kids, which was presumably taken on Easter Sunday. At first glance, it's a pretty typical shot. Kim and Kanye aren't smiling. North West looks cute as a button. Baby Chicago is fast asleep. And Saint is refusing to look at the camera.	1
"Movie  Report says that the actor will star in the remake of the sex comedy, which starred Warren Beatty, Goldie Hawn and Carrie Fisher back in 1975.  Jun 10, 2017  AceShowbiz - Report says that %cLeonardo DiCaprio% may star in the remake of ""Shampoo"", a 1975 sex comedy which featured %cWarren Beatty%, %cGoldie Hawn% and %cCarrie Fisher%. According to National Enquirer, Beatty is producing the remake and has chosen DiCaprio to play his then-role, a sexed up hairdresser.  A source tells National Enquirer that ""the idea's got [Beatty] bubbling, and he's convinced Leo's a natural"" to wear his ""sex-soaked costumes."" In the original movie, Beatty played a hairdresser who slept with his wealthy female clients.  However, Gossip Cop has learned that the report is simply not true. An insider close to DiCaprio tells the site that DiCaprio is not in talks to star in ""Shampoo"" reboot. In addition, an insider related to Beatty tells the site that ""the filmmaker isn't working on a remake of the comedy."" Gossip Cop goes on saying that ""DiCaprio tends to gravitate towards more serious fare. In fact, the only film on his entire resume that might be considered a comedy is 'The Wolf of Wall Street', which had plenty of dramatic elements as well.""  DiCaprio, who is also known as an environmentalist, earned critical acclaims for his performance in ""The Wolf of Wall Street"", ""Django Unchained"", ""Blood Diamond"" and ""Revolutionary Road"". The actor nabbed an Oscar for his role as Hugh Glass in semi-biographical western film ""The Revenant"".

But Ms. Kotb, a longtime fan favorite for her freewheeling segments with Ms. Gifford, has provided more than a steadying hand, and may even have given the show a boost. NBC has defeated its ABC rival “Good Morning America” every week since Mr. Lauer was removed, something it had not done for four consecutive weeks in more than five years.  The “Today” lead has narrowed — the program averaged around 4.4 million viewers the week before Christmas, about 54,000 viewers more than “G.M.A.” — and there is some uncertainty whether the lead is sustainable. Further, all three morning shows experienced rating drops last year.  A surprise boon from an emergency host isn’t new at NBC. When Brian Williams was suspended for six months in 2015 from his evening newscast after he was caught embellishing stories about a Middle East reporting assignment, Lester Holt replaced him and the show’s viewership figures were strong. Mr. Holt became the permanent replacement later that year.  Likewise, the departures of Charlie Rose from “CBS This Morning” and Mr. O’Reilly from Fox News after public allegations of sexual misconduct have done little to disrupt either network. Fox News is still No. 1 among cable news networks in prime time, and the ratings for “CBS This Morning” have held steady while Gayle King and Norah O’Donnell continue in Mr. Rose’s absence. (CBS has not yet hired a replacement.)  Ms. Kotb cut her teeth as a local reporter and anchor, including a six-year stint for the CBS affiliate in New Orleans. She joined NBC in 1998 as a correspondent for “Dateline.”	0

The pair flew to St Barts this week along with Scott's kids, Mason, eight, Penelope, five, and Reign, three.  While Sofia holidaying with the kids is a sure enough sign that the loved-up pair are more serious than ever, Scott also proudly shared a candid snap of his 19-year-old girlfriend massaging his feet on Sunday.  The picture shows Lionel Richie's daughter, who has been dating Scott since last summer, sitting in front of him rubbing his feet as he lays down, with the ocean spread out in front of them.  (Image: Instagram/letthelordbewithyou)  ""Could be worse,"" the 35-year-old captioned the picture.  Their pet pooch also makes a starring role in the snap.  The previous day Sofia publicly professed her love for her boyfriend while wishing him a happy birthday on Instagram.  While she usually keeps their romance on the down-low when it comes to social media, she proudly shared a snap of them cuddling up alongside the sweet message: ""Happy Birthday babe! Thank you for being you. Love you.""  (Image: Instagram/sofiarichie)  With a 16 year age gap, many thought their relationship wouldn't last - but these recent posts appear to prove the pair are stronger than ever.  Dad-of-three Scott also received a handful of social media messages from the Kardashians on his big day.  Khloe, who recently welcomed daughter True Thompson, posted four vintage snaps of her and Scott, including one of her slapping him across the face.  ""We came a long way. Remember when I slapped you?"" Khloe jokingly captioned it.  (Image: Getty Images North America) (Image: Getty Images North America)  Kim also shared a series of funny pictures of the pair of them together over the years.  One showed a US magazine cover that claimed Scott was 'in love' with Kim, while another showed the birthday boy playing third wheel as the reality star walked hand-in-hand with husband Kanye West.  Scott himself uploaded pictures of him and his three kids, including an adorable snap of daughter Penelope who laid out dozens of flowers to spell 'dad'."	1

ABC has renewed “Modern Family” for two more seasons of 22 episodes each, TheWrap has learned.  The hit family comedy has officially been renewed through Season 10, which will air in the 2018-19 season. The order will bring the series to a staggering total of 232 episodes.  The news comes after months of negotiations between the network, producers 20th Century Fox Television and the cast, whose previous deals expired at the end of Season 8, though a renewal was likely always in the cards given the show’s success in the ratings.  Also Read: 'Scandal' to End After Season 7  “Modern Family has been the centerpiece of our comedy brand for eight seasons and we are thrilled to have it on our schedule for two more years. Steve and Chris have created such endearing characters, and the cast is second-to-none,” said ABC Entertainment President Channing Dungey in a statement.  “We are beyond thrilled that we get to spend more time with these characters, these amazing actors, our ridiculously-talented writers and our incredible crew – all of whom are like family to us. And the good kind of family, not the kind that argues with you all the time,” added co-creator and executive producer Steve Levitan.  Also Read: ABC Closes Deal to Revive 'American Idol'  “Modern Family” joins the Shondaland dramas “Grey’s Anatomy,” “Scandal” and “How to Get Away With Murder” and the long-running comedy “The Middle” as the five ABC shows already renewed. The Kerry Washington-led “Scandal” is reportedly set to end after the conclusion of its seventh season next year.  The news comes as the broadcast networks begin to finalize their fall programming slates ahead of the upfront presentations next week. ABC also recently announced that it will revive the Fox reality singing competition series “American Idol” next season.	1
"There were plenty of Heavenly Bodies at last night's Met Gala, but there was no divine intervention quite like Nicki Minaj and Cardi B joining forces and hanging out inside the event.  After months and months of feud rumors and alleged shade, the female rappers shared a moment (and even snapped a few selfies) at last night's fashion event. Inside the Met, the two were photographed mid-conversation as Moschino designer Jeremy Scott (who was Cardi B's date) watched on like a proud dad.

"The Duggar family and stars of TLC's Counting On just keep on growing. Last month, Joseph Duggar and his wife, Kendra (Caldwell) Duggar, welcomed their first child — a son named Garrett David Duggar. But since Counting On wasn't airing new episodes at the time of their son's birth, fans weren't able to follow along with Joseph and Kendra's journey to becoming parents — until now. In a new special, posted on TLC's website, fans were able to find out about some pretty exciting and intimate details about the couple as they got ready for their son's arrival. For example, Kendra Duggar revealed she and her mom were pregnant at the same time and how they bonded even more during those overlapping months.  Although the Duggar family might be a little more used to the spotlight, Kendra's parents aren't necessarily as high profile as Joseph's parents, Jim Bob and Michelle Duggar. Kendra's parents, Paul and Christina Caldwell, are reportedly in their early 40s and late 30s, respectively, according to In Touch Weekly. Paul, who is a pastor, and Christina have seven children together, according to In Touch Weekly — and Kendra confirmed, in her new special, that her parents have one more on the way.  In the episode, as Kendra took breathing lessons from her mom, she said that her mom was also expecting a baby. As seen in the TLC special, Kendra said:  We found that my mom was expecting about a month ago. I think this has definitely been really interesting because we've been able to share a lot of things that we didn't get to share before so I feel like we've become even more like friends. And I guess our relationship has gone more to a different level, I guess.  Considering Kendra's parents' ages, it's not necessarily shocking to learn that they're expecting another child right now. It's pretty cool that Kendra's son will grow up close in age to her baby brother (aka baby Garrett's uncle), when he does arrive. Not only that, but you can tell that Kendra is so happy that these simultaneous pregnancies brought the two of them closer together.  On Reddit user even predicted this, seven months ago. ""I'm calling it now! At some point Kendra and her mom will be pregnant at the same time,"" they wrote. But this wasn't the only thing that was revealed during the two-part birthing special that might have been shocking for fans to find out.  Kendra Was Afraid Of Her Breathing During Labor  You read that right. During the first part of her labor special, Kendra said that she had to practice breathing before she left for the hospital and gave birth, because she needed to be reminded of how to do it. Kendra explained in the episode:  I tend to want to stop breathing and just kind of hold my breath when I'm in a lot of pain. And that's something that even during my childhood I've had to work on when I would fall down — to remember to breathe and not hold my breath because that causes more problems.  ""If she was by herself, I think that would happen and she would pass out,"" Kendra's sister, Lauren Caldwell, said in the episode. ""But with all of us there, I know I could help her not pass out."" Very reassuring.  Kendra Did Not Opt For A Home Birth  Although Kendra's sister-in-laws might have opted for home births, she revealed during the beginning of the episode that she had planned on giving birth in a hospital. From the time that fans are introduced to Joe and Kendra in the episode, it is shown that they were planning on watching her contractions over night before making the call to head to the hospital, which was 25 minutes away from their home. But, they were able to make it to the hospital in time before Kendra's labor progressed any further.  Joseph's Siblings Welcomed The Couple Home With A Special Gift  During the episode, it was revealed that Joseph's many siblings were so, so excited for their nephew's birth and welcomed Joseph, Kendra, and Garrett home with special welcome gifts for the new family. The gifts, organized by Joseph's older sister, Je"	1

Leah Remini has made big waves over the years by talking openly about Scientology. After leaving the church, she has talked about the weird and allegedly illegal actions that take place within the organization. Her latest venture is the TV series Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath, which came out with some huge claims.  Now, partly due to her investigation, it has come out that five women alleged that That ’70s Show star Danny Masterson raped them and that the organization helped cover it up. So what exactly is going on? Here are 11 things we know about the Danny Masterson rape allegations, including one victim believing the LAPD is compromised (No. 8).  1. Multiple women accused the actor of sexually assaulting them  Danny Masterson | Anna Webber/Getty Images for Netflix Danny Masterson | Anna Webber/Getty Images for Netflix  This shocking news comes from three women who accused the That ’70s Show actor of raping and sodomizing them in the early 2000s. The story broke on Tony Ortega’s blog, The Underground Bunker, which primarily covers Scientology.  The alleged victims are also Scientologists, who claim they were pressured to not go to the police after the crimes. This isn’t the first time Scientology has been accused of covering up such situations.  On Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath, ex-Scientologist Amy Scobee claimed that her boss at the Scientology Celebrity Centre took advantage of her sexually when she was 14 years old. After this was reported to the organization, no one told her parents or the police. In response to the claim, Scientology leaders said Scobee “cannot be trusted as a reliable source.”  Next: Remini’s involvement with Victim A.  2. Remini reportedly encouraged Victim A to file a report  Leah Remini on Leah Remini Scientology and the Aftermath | A&E Leah Remini on Leah Remini Scientology and the Aftermath | A&E  The actress has been working closely with multiple people in order to tell their Scientology horror stories, so it’s not surprising that she encouraged a woman who some are calling “Victim A” to file a police report. This move created a domino effect, making it so the other claims are taken more seriously.  Next: How Scientology threatened Victim A.  3. Victim A claims that Masterson raped her in 2001  Danny Masterson as Hyde on That ’70s Show. | 20th Century Fox Television Danny Masterson as Hyde on That ’70s Show. | 20th Century Fox Television  The woman who has come forward reportedly dated the actor for six years. She claims the actor anally raped and injured her when she was unconscious in December of 2001. She didn’t come forward initially because of Scientology’s threat that she would be labeled a “suppressive person.” This means that those in the organization will no longer be allowed to contact her, which has allegedly led to many families being torn apart.  “They threatened me that if I ever told anyone or reported him to the police that I would be declared a ‘suppressive person’ and lose everything and everyone,” she wrote to LAPD chief Charlie Beck. “Then they put me on a massive ethics program as punishment. My rapist was not punished at all. They didn’t even call him to talk about it. I ended up breaking up with him two months later.”  Next: Victim B has the case closed after Scientology members contradict her.  4. Victim B filed a report in 2004  Danny Masterson arrives at the Rampart special screening. | Christopher Polk/Getty Images Danny Masterson arrives at thespecial screening. | Christopher Polk/Getty Images  Victim B’s alleged rape happened in 2003 and the woman filed in 2004. The investigation was closed after witnesses who are members of Scientology contradicted her testimony. Now that Victim A has come forward, the case with Victim B has been reopened.

Change is afoot when Netflix’s hit period drama “The Crown” returns for a second season.  Not only will there be a changing of the guard at the end of the 10 new episodes, as Season 2 is both Claire Foy and Matt Smith’s final seasons playing Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, respectively, but also there will be new settings and relationships within the story.  To begin with, Philip takes a five-month journey to faraway lands to be the royal face at events like the Olympic Games, which will move much of the story out of the confines of Buckingham Palace, while Princess Margaret (Vanessa Kirby) balks at the constraints of royal expectations and finds a new love in photographer Antony Armstrong-Jones, better known as Lord Snowdon (Matthew Goode).  “The family explodes out of the palace: Philip’s out on tour and Margaret suddenly gets into a reality of London that she’s never experienced before. It’s not a fairy tale love story. She’s actually meeting somebody when she’s still extremely wounded and so is he, as we later discover,” Kirby tells Variety. “Matthew Goode is incredible. He encapsulated everything Margaret was trying to discover in season one, which was anti-establishment, anti-royal [and] made her feel — at least temporarily — more complete.”  For Kirby, a continued challenge comes to portraying Princess Margaret in that duality of being “so essentially royal” and “part of this old establishment” while still wanting to be “normal and a modern woman.” In the second season, her forward motion as a somewhat unwilling princess straining at the confines of royal responsibility are front and center.  “It’s more about how Margaret is wrestling with remaining part of her family and not having a choice of the way she wants to live her life — the man and the children she would have had,” Kirby says of the emotional journey. “She’s attempting to define herself in contrary to it. That’s why she finds someone very distinctly unroyal, that’s not approved by the establishment, that’s not aristocratic. She finds her salvation in [Snowdon], who is the antithesis of her life and past.”  Snowdon has a significant effect on Margaret when it comes to her “sense of place in the world,” Kirby continues. “Her autonomy to meet someone who was her wingman and someone she could confide in and love and walk down the aisle with [was] something she’d always been waiting to do.”  Meanwhile, the continued complexity of playing Philip, for Smith, comes from the fact that he is a man who loves his wife but is perpetually frustrated being in second position to her royal needs and responsibilities.  “I’m always really compelled by the deep conflict in Philip,” Smith says, citing “his duty to himself as a man” first. “He’s a very male character, whatever that means nowadays, and his duty to his wife and the strange conflict it generates in him: the desire to be the head of the family and being usurped. They’re weirdly similar in that way, Philip and Margaret, they wanted their own wings but they were constantly being clipped.”  This is something Kirby has noticed throughout the series as well. “When Philip says, ‘You’ve taken my name, you’ve taken my home,’ that’s what every woman says. It was quite amazing to see a series where a man says that,” she points out.  Smith acknowledges that the public’s ongoing fascination with the royal family and what they may be like behind closed doors versus their public appearances is a driving factor for the second season of “The Crown.” “They’re often most interesting when they’re being domestic. That’s what’s good about the show: you come to understand they’re normal human beings — their blood isn’t blue, contrary to popular opinion,” he says.  To that point, viewers will also learn more about Philip’s younger years. “We glimpse the difficulty and the pain and tragedy he went through and we see why he is the way he is now. We see the sardonic, dry wit and where it comes from; it’s borne out of pain	1
    Beyoncé looks exactly like daughter Blue Ivy in a throwback photo her mother, Tina Knowles Lawson, shared on Instagram on Saturday, October 7.  A young Bey is getting her hair done in the photo that Knowles Lawson posted along with the caption, “If Beyoncé don’t look like Blue on this photo!!! Getting her braids done by Toni.”  If Beyonce don’t look like Blue on this photo!!! Getting her braids done by Toni❤️ A post shared by Tina Knowles (@mstinalawson) on Oct 7, 2017 at 12:40pm PDT  Commenters agreed with her, writing, “Omg thought it was blue!” “Twins!” wrote another.  A lot of people have remarked over the years how much Beyoncé and husband Jay-Z’s oldest child looks like her daddy, but this pic proves that the 5-year-old takes after both her mom and her dad.  R&B singer Melanie Fiona previously told Us Weekly that when Blue was a baby she resembled the rapper. “Beyonce says Blue changes every day and looks just like Jay now,” Fiona told Us in 2012.  Lena Dunham, a card-carrying member of the Beyhive, told Us in February, shortly after the Grammy winner announced that she was expecting twins, that Blue Ivy “is an icon.”  Beyoncé welcomed twins Sir and Rumi in June, and while the singer shared a pic of the babies shortly after their birth, they’ve been kept under wraps since then, so it remains to be seen which of their parents they resemble.  One thing’s for sure, Blue is a doting big sister to her siblings. Knowles Lawson told Us last month that her new grandbabies are “adorable and just beautiful and healthy” and Blue is “excited” to help look after them and pick out their outfits. “She feeds them,” Knowles Lawson added. “And she feels responsible for them being here because she prayed for them.”	1
"Kate and Prince William already have three children together - Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis. As Prince William’s brother Prince Harry is expecting his first child with Meghan Markle, bookies have slashed the odds on the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge expecting a baby as well. Bookies Coral have released odds over a sudden announcement from the future King and Queen of England as the odds now shows the chance of Kate being pregnant at 1/2 - a 50 percent chance.  Coral's Harry Aitkenhead said: ""Our odds show that there's every chance that Kate and Wills might add to their growing family, and a fourth baby is certainly a possibility.  “We've taken some bets over the last two weeks or so on it happening and there's a real buzz around the Royal family at the moment with Meghan expecting.”  But whether the Duchess of Cambridge will follow in the Queen’s footstep by having four children is yet to be confirmed.  One source has said he does not think Kate will have more children as he thinks “Kate is done” after suffering extreme morning sickness throughout her three previous pregnancies."	1
Peggy Sulahian will not be returning to the Real Housewives of Orange County.  The reality star announced her departure from the series after just one season on Instagram on Tuesday, expressing how honored she was to have been the franchise’s 100th housewife.  “What an exciting experience it was to be part of The Real Housewives of Orange County!” Sulahian wrote. “It was an honor to be the 100th housewife and to be part of the Bravo family. I am extremely proud of being the 1st Armenian-American Housewife and sharing my culture with the world.”  “While I faced and conquered many challenges, I’m grateful for the opportunity to share my story and spread awareness of breast cancer. Dealing with the disease and the passing of my father challenged me to reassess and reflect on my life, and I’ve realized what’s most important is leading a healthy and happy life, surrounded by people who care and love you,” she continued. “At this point, moving on seemed like the right thing to do. A few new ventures have availed themselves, and I look forward to sharing them with you soon!”  During an October interview with ET’s Brice Sander, Sulahian said she would stick around for another season if she was asked to return.  “If they like me, and they want class and not trash, they’ll have me back,” she insisted.  In January, she teased her return with fellow housewife Lydia McLaughlin on Instagram.  Meanwhile, McLaughlin also recently announced her RHOC exit on her blog, explaining that the show “has given me a great platform and I’m grateful for that. However, I feel like I can only handle this show one season at a time. I need a break! There is a lot of good that comes from the show, but also a lot of negativity.”  “After a family vote, it was unanimous that I should take a break. Sometimes the people who love us the most see things even we don’t see. I trust my path and I’m excited for what the future holds,” she added.  Sulahian and McLaughlin’s departures follow Meghan King Edmonds’ exit last month, leaving Kelly Dodd and Shannon Beador as the only confirmed housewives returning next season.

Karrueche was leaving 1OAK in West Hollywood when she bristled at the notion that Chris Brown scared her away from posting pics of herself with other guys.

Get this ... last night Chris and Tyson showed up at the same place -- the iHeartRadio Summer Pool Party in Vegas. Unclear if they interacted, but no one left bloodied.	0

"Fifth Harmony’s Normani Kordei made a profound statement on “Dancing With the Stars” last week when she danced to the song ""Freedom"" by Anthony Hamilton and Elayna Boynton – receiving a perfect score – and opened up about being cyber-bullied.  Interested in DWTS? Add DWTS as an interest to stay up to date on the latest DWTS news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest  The 20-year-old pop singer revealed on “DWTS” that she was “bullied terribly on social media” after she did a 2016 Facebook Live interview with the website Galore, in which she paused before saying her fellow bandmate Camila Cabello is “very quirky.” Some took that to be an insult, and Kordei received a wave of online backlash.  “I did an interview, it was taken out of context,” Kordei told ABC News’ “Nightline” during a sit down interview at at The Grove in Los Angeles. “There were images, people were calling me, like the ‘n’ word… I was getting racial slander. Images of me being whipped, hung, beaten and it really affected me.”  Watch the full story on ""Nightline"" tonight at 12:35 a.m. ET  Kordei said she was accused of being disrespectful, and when she apologized for the inadvertent offense, the online hatred only worsened.  “That’s the thing about social media, there’s no repercussions,” she said. “I feel like then I became more reserved and closed off person, and afraid of letting people in.”  The abuse became so bad that Kordei said she took a hiatus from all social media for two months, which was difficult for her.  “It’s part of my job,” she said. “It’s just part of who we are and how we communicate, so I just felt with me stepping away from social media for two whole months, my core fans, I felt I was neglecting them in a way.”  Kordei first rose to fame as a participant on the “The X Factor” in 2012. She then became one of the teen girls molded by famed music producer Simon Cowell to be a part of the all-female group Fifth Harmony. “Worth It” was their first big hit.  Most recently, Kordei has been a participant on “DWTS."" It was her dance partner Val Chmerkovskiy who encouraged her to share her story, she said.  “The beauty is it [social media] gave a voice to everybody,” Chmerkovskiy said. “But the downside is it also gave a voice to everybody. And a lot of people don’t have the best intentions, for whatever reason.”  Kordei was raised in New Orleans and says she has dealt with bullies since she was young.  “I went to a predominantly white school and I stuck out because I was the black girl, but I would get teased for the color of my skin and wonder why,” she said. “I remember we were playing outside and the first thing this little girl would tell me was, ‘Leave me alone you burnt biscuit.’ … I mean, where do you get that from, especially being so young?”  After coming back on social media, Kordei said she continues to deal with hate from anonymous internet users every day.  “What I learned in how to deal with it is it has absolutely nothing to do about me,” she said. “It’s genuinely an insecurity that other people have in themselves. or something that they lack that you may have that they want… That’s why I can’t carry hate in my heart.”  She hopes her dancing every Monday night on “DWTS” will inspire others not to be afraid to be proud of who they are.  “I think that at the end of the day as humans we just need to be more sympathetic to each other,” she said.  ABC's Nick Watt contributed to this report"	1

Is Laura Govan pregnant with Vincent Herbert’s baby? She’s telling all! Watch the video here!  For those of you who may not know, Tamar Braxton, 40, and Vincent Herbert, 44, are going through a nasty divorce. Tamar recently shed light on Vincent’s alleged infidelity, explaining that he got another woman pregnant, and that woman is Laura Govan, 38. This news shocked many fans, but Laura talked to E! News to clear the air, saying it’s not true! She sat down for an interview with the Daily Pop and said that, when it comes to her being pregnant with Vince’s baby, “That part is laughable, but the rest isn’t.” She continued with, “You know at first it’s like, ‘Is this a joke?’ Because I literally woke up to something that is just not true and I was thinking, ‘I’ve worked so hard to get away from certain stigmas and all the drama before.” Laura appeared as calm as ever and we’re glad the truth is finally out there.  Tamar, on the other hand, may not share the same sentiments. We reported earlier that, Tamar is completely heartbroken and confused over her divorce. We must admit, we are slightly confused too. The couple has gone back and forth over the past few days, and we just want to understand what’s going on. After fighting on Christmas Day, the estranged couple spent New Year’s Eve together. Tamar also took to Twitter Dec. 30, to defend Vince against accusations that, he abused artists he managed back in the 90s. As if this story couldn’t get any more dramatic, Tamar has since deleted her Instagram.  They’ve had a rough end of the year, and an equally rough start to 2018. Despite their differences, Tamar and Vince are trying to work things out for the sake of their son, Logan, 4. Before deleting her Instagram she wrote, “Nope! Sorry we are not together but since the craziness the other day we did agree to create a better environment for my son. Angry or not, it’s about my son.” She added in the caption “P.S. We ALSO agreed not to speak on this anymore in public after this! My son can read and he’s NOT dumb #2018goals #praymystrengthinthelord I’ve made LOTS of mistakes and I’m just trying to be a better person.”  HollywoodLifers, what do you think of Laura Govan’s comment about the pregnancy rumors?

There's a chance for another Brad and Jen, but this time it isn't Jennifer Aniston. Multiple reports are claiming that Jennifer Lawrence and Brad Pitt are now dating.  Both stars are newly single, Lawrence recently split from director boyfriend Darren Aronofsky and Pitt is in the process of divorcing longtime partner and wife of two years, Angelia Jolie.  Rumors of their romance began on Wednesday and the story graces the cover of this week’s issue of Star Magazine. Sources told the publication that “Brad has had his eye on Jennifer for years. [They] have been enjoying lots of late nights together. There’s an intense connection between them!”  An insider also told the magazine that Pitt allegedly reached out to Lawrence after getting her phone number from a mutual friend. The source added that Pitt was nervous to contact Lawrence, but was encouraged by friends to make the first move.  However, the tabloid checking website Gossip Cop reported that despite reports about the two A-listers becoming a pair, for now the rumors remain just rumors.  According to The Sun, Lawrence broke up with Aronofsy after a year of dating due to their great difference in age. But age hasn’t seemed to stop Lawrence before. Before dating Aronofsky, Lawrence had a short fling with Coldplay lead singer and ex-husband a Gwyneth Paltrow, Chris Martin — Paltrow being another common thread between her and Brad.  Prior to dating Martin, Lawrence dated her 28-year-old “X-Men” co-star, Nicolas Hoult, for five years off and on. The two ended their relationship in August of 2014.  The Sun also reported that sources close to Pitt have denied the dating rumors and said that he and Lawrence are not together.	0

"Emily Ratajkowski, Gabrielle Union and Patricia Arquette called out the 'Big Bang Theory' star on social media after she wrote it was ""wise"" to dress ""modestly"" and not act ""flirtatiously"" with men.  Mayim Bialik has come under fire from several of her Hollywood peers after the Big Bang Theory actress wrote an op-ed column titled ""Being a Feminist in Harvey Weinstein's World,"" for the New York Times.  In the piece published on Friday, Bialik, 41, describes coming of age as a ""prominent-nosed, awkward, geeky, Jewish 11-year-old,"" and being aware that she was different from her onscreen contemporaries of the late '80s, who she says were praised for their curves.  ""I have always had an uncomfortable relationship with being employed in an industry that profits on the objectification of women,"" she writes, adding that from an early age she made ""wise"" personal choices in order to protect herself, including dressing ""modestly"" and not acting ""flirtatiously"" with men.  ""I am entirely aware that these types of choices might feel oppressive to many young feminists,"" she added. ""Women should be able to wear whatever they want. They should be able to flirt however they want with whomever they want.""  Despite her concession that it shouldn't be the duty of women ""to police our own behavior,"" the suggestion that her strategies would be helpful in staving off sexual predators enraged many people on social media, including Gabrielle Union, Emily Ratajkowski and Patricia Arquette, who all posted that dressing conservatively is not effective; many also accused Bialik of victim-blaming.  Reminder. I got raped at work at a Payless shoe store. I had on a long tunic & leggings so miss me w/ ""dress modestly"" shit. — Gabrielle Union (@itsgabrielleu) October 15, 2017  .@missmayim I have to say I was dressed non provocatively at 12 walking home from school when men masturbated at me. It's not the clothes. — Patricia Arquette (@PattyArquette) October 14, 2017  So @missmayim ""advice"" is: I was never pretty & never tried to be & ladies, take note if you don't want to be harassed? This isn't feminism pic.twitter.com/0Rrx6jrE5K — Emily Ratajkowski (@emrata) October 15, 2017  Others criticized the Times as an institution for giving a platform to ""dangerous"" opinions. ""Mayim Bialik’s piece is part of the problem w/ the myth of journalistic objectivity, which suggests even dangerous opinions deserve platform,"" wrote Jamilah Lemieux, a culture critic and editor.  Mayim Bialik’s piece is part of the problem w/ the myth of journalistic objectivity, which suggests even dangerous opinions deserve platform — Jamilah Lemieux (@JamilahLemieux) October 15, 2017  Another repeated critique of Bialik's piece is that her focus on not being a ""perfect 10"" in Hollywood and the ensuing decision to focus more on ""what was inside my brain than what was inside my bra"" was relevant to the discussion of sexual assault.  The schadenfruede that Mayim Bialik seems to have over the fact that she thinks that only pretty girls are sexually assaulted is gross — Ijeoma Oluo (@IjeomaOluo) October 15, 2017  Bialik has previously come under fire for criticizing women for dressing provocatively; in 2014 she wrote a piece for Kveller about a billboard featuring Ariana Grande in which she lamented that ""women are expected to be sexy and sexually available no matter what we do in society.""

"[Warning: This story contains spoilers from the seventh- season finale of American Horror Story: Cult, ""Great Again.""]  One throwaway line in the season finale of American Horror Story: Cult placed the seventh cycle of the FX horror anthology within the larger AHS world: ""If she turned down Lana Winters, why the fuck would she say 'yes' to Rachel Maddow?""  The question came from Beverly Hope (Adina Porter) about her fellow cult survivor, Ally Mayfair-Richards (Sarah Paulson). Once again, franchise leading lady Paulson played a famous survivor, only this time she turned down an offer to be interviewed by the first famous survivor she played in the Ryan Murphy franchise — AHS' version of Barbara Walters, Lana Winter. Paulson played Lana in season two, Asylum, and came out of retirement to reprise her Briarcliff journalist last season in Roanoke. The finale stunt was AHS' most high-profile season crossover to date, solidifying how all of the seasons exist in one big, twisted universe. Though Cult also resurrected AHS villain Twisty the Clown (John Carroll Lynch) this season, callbacks to the larger AHS universe were slight.  Ahead of Roanoke, co-creator and showrunner Murphy confirmed what AHS viewers had long suspected, that all seasons of the franchise are, in fact, connected. When speaking to The Hollywood Reporter last year, Murphy promised of the tie-ins, ""You'll see it this season, and then you'll really see it after this season. We lay a lot of pipe, and you'll see it explode in seasons seven and eight.""  Roanoke doubled down on Murphy's promise with its AHS mythology nods, but now that the finale of Cult has come and gone: Did the election throw a wrench into Murphy's plans for the larger universe?  ""The writers have their finger on the pulse of what’s going on,"" star Evan Peters tells THR about Cult delivering a provocative and timely ending, instead of a thematic one. ""The writers were ahead of the curve with the riots in Charlottesville [Va.], something Ryan has talked about. And when filming the ending, at the time it did feel relevant. Now, it's horrible what's happening, but it's a good thing that women are getting their power back.""  This season documented Kai Anderson's (Peters) rise from a basement-dwelling Trump supporter to a small-town cult leader to a candidate for Michigan's open Senate seat. In order to accomplish that, Peters morphed into five real-life cult leaders — Charles Manson, Jim Jones, David Koresh, Marshall Applewhite and Andy Warhol — to hammer home Murphy's point of how a man, like Donald Trump, can rise within a disenfranchised community.  The finale, titled ""Great Again,"" also came full circle as the women of the cult came out successful — unlike Trump vs. Clinton — in their resistance. The finale revealed a layered plan enacted by Ally, who was working with the FBI to arrest Kai. Ultimately, the two swapped roles. Kai was sentenced to prison and Ally was now running for the Senate seat he had so desired. Her campaign platform echoed Hillary Clinton's run for president and rings even more true in the wake of the country's current climate where women are taking back power and speaking out about stories of sexual harassment and assault.  “All my life I have been told to smile. Stay quiet. Look pretty. Not to stand out from the crowd,"" Ally said in a campaign ad. When her approval ratings revealed a distrust from Americans that she could get the job done in a stark Clinton parallel, she noted that the results were code for fear: ""They’re scared. Isn’t it sad when a strong woman scares people more than clowns?""  Cult then depicted a new kind of post-election America, one different than the world it had created thus far. Though the setting was now two years after the 2016 presidential election, Ally's first televised debate mimicked moments when Clinton would outwit Trump (""I am tired of being mansplained to,"" Ally said to her male opponent). Cult then took the analogy even further when Kai manage"	1
"Celebrity Chef Gordon Ramsay is known for his tough love methods on his Fox show Hell's Kitchen, but he was his own worst critic when it came to his weight.  In an interview with The Daily Mail, Ramsay shared how his wife, Tana, was his biggest source of motivation for losing weight because she has always been a fitness enthusiast and let him know she wasn't pleased with his weight gain, according to People.  ""Tana was not impressed with the way I was,"" Ramsay revealed. ""I was overweight, 18 stone [over 250 pounds]. I looked like a sack of s--t. I look at the pictures and think, 'How did Tana stay around?' Because Tana has got better-looking and more gorgeous. And there she is, getting in bed with a fat f--k.""  Getty Images  Gordon and Tana have been married for over 20 years and have four children together, and at the time of his weight gain, he had just won his third Michelin star. But despite those accomplishments, Ramsay said he still suffered from low self-esteem.  ""It was painful,"" he said. ""I used to look at myself in the mirror and think, 'Holy s--t!' So it was a big wake-up call.""  The chef attributed his weight gain to not eating properly when working long hours and during vacation trips with David and Victoria Beckham and their respective families. ""I didn't have a figure,"" Ramsay said. ""I didn't feel that good. After working my a-- off and achieving a lot, I wanted to get in serious shape.""  Gordon Ramsay in June 2011. Getty Images  ""I don't want my industry to kill me,"" he continued. ""I know how unhealthy chefs are at the top level. Stress. Suicide. There's a big downside to cooking loads for a living. It's lethal: from obesity to heart attacks to cocaine habits.""  Around 2012, Ramsay began to make life change. ""I started focusing on getting super-fit five or six years ago when my life got super-busy,"" he told The Daily Mail. ""You get consumed by the work. You get sucked up. You get drawn in. All of a sudden your 'me time' is zero. There was no breathing space, no down time, no time to even think straight. It all started hitting me hard. I didn't panic, but my head was not in the game.""  Ramsay teamed up with a trainer named Will Usher who has him ride bikes in the home gym for an hour and do other workout regiments at least three times a week.  Since then, Ramsay has lost about 56 pounds and his weight has gone down to approximately 196 pounds. The 51-year-old said he stays inspired to lead a healthy lifestyle, because he does not want to die at a young age like his dad, who passed away at 53.

Liberation is a fitting title for the eighth studio album from multi-platinum superstar artist Christina Aguilera, given that freeing herself from other people’s expectations is a significant theme that appears throughout the singer, songwriter, and actress’s remarkable life and career. From surviving the domestic violence she and her mother endured at the hands of her father when Aguilera was a child, to freeing herself from the constraints of her teen-pop image by wrestling creative control over her musical output with her blockbuster albums, the 4x-platinum, Grammy-winning Stripped and chart-topping, 3x-platinum, Grammy-winning Back to Basics, to the present, in which Aguilera is returning to music after serving as a judge on The Voice and acting in several movies and television shows….	0
Tom Cruise’s personal life is again on the media’s radar as his ex-wife, Katie Holmes, and his former friend, Jamie Foxx, are planning to move ahead as an alleged couple. Tom, who is currently busy filming Mission: Impossible 6 with Vanessa Kirby, is reportedly planning to settle down. According to reports, the actor is afraid that just like his father, he is also going to die of cancer and wishes to reunite with his 11-year-old daughter, Suri Cruise.  Ever since Katie Holmes and Tom Cruise announced their divorce, the entire entertainment world started to talk about Suri and how she would be raised without a father figure in her life. However, Katie proved herself as an excellent mother, as she did not let any news affect her life with her daughter. She was recently spotted enjoying a hockey game with Suri and even her Instagram pictures show the bond she shares with her daughter.  As Katie and Jamie are moving on together in their personal lives, recent reports suggest that even Tom Cruise has decided to settle down again. It was recently reported by Inquisitr that Tom Cruise reportedly has the hots for his Mission: Impossible 6 co-star Vanessa Kirby. An alleged insider revealed that Tom admired Vanessa’s work and reportedly persuaded other producers to give The Crown actress a crucial role in the sixth installment of Mission: Impossible series.  ???? @netflix A post shared by Vanessa Kirby (@vanessa__kirby) on Aug 10, 2016 at 3:27am PDT  Tom Cruise, who was previously married to Mimi Rogers, Nicole Kidman, and Katie Holmes, has reportedly decided to make Vanessa Kirby the next Mrs. Cruise.  But it is not only a life partner which Tom desires. According to a recent report, Tom is planning to reintroduce Suri back in his life.  After Tom’s divorce with Katie, there were alleged reports that due to the Church of Scientology, one of Hollywood’s most loved actors was not allowed to see or meet his own daughter. It was previously reported that Tom has not seen Suri for over three years and even the pre-teen girl has stopped missing her dad.  “With his desire to reintroduce his estranged daughter Suri into his life, along with his plan to be married again ‘by early next year,’ Tom — who is also father to 24-year-old Bella and 22-year-old Connor with Nicole Kidman — is getting his life back where he wants it,” reads the report.

The recent report further alleged that Katie thinks that her ex-husband does not approve of her relationship with Jamie Foxx. She also thinks that her former husband can influence Suri to follow the Church of Scientology — reportedly the main reason why Katie asked for a divorce.  The report also alleged that when Katie and Jamie decide to get married, it will be a small ceremony, as the Dawson’s Creek’s actress is afraid of the Vanilla Sky actor.  Loading...  [Image by Neilson Barnard/Getty Images]  “She’s terrified of how her ex-husband will react to her moving on to a new life with another man. She’s worried Tom could come crashing back into her and Suri’s lives, take her to court to get more custody and try to sway Suri over to Scientology,” an alleged insider revealed.  ???????????????????????????????????? #nationaldaughterday ???????????????????? A post shared by Katie Holmes (@katieholmes212) on Sep 27, 2017 at 8:18pm PDT  It is still not confirmed when Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx will announce their marriage. As of now, the two haven’t even released a statement about their alleged affair. On the other hand, Tom Cruise’s representatives have not commented on the recent claims that suggest that he is planning to get Suri back in his life, as he reportedly moves ahead to settle down with Vanessa Kirby.

See photos: Oscars Red Carpet Arrivals  “You know what I could really go for? A hot pocket,” Leto says in Fallon’s “Celebrity Whispers” segment that aired on Wednesday night.  “Hey, what is this called again?” Eastwood asks Cooper.  “Oh, this is a tuxedo. Just a regular tuxedo,” Cooper says. “I don’t like them, though. I feel so proper.”  See video: Jon Stewart Can’t Believe Fox News Outrage Over ‘American Sniper’ Oscars ‘Snub’  Meanwhile, Cumberbatch’s lips matched up perfectly with lyrics to Mark Ronson’s catchy single featuring Bruno Mars, “Uptown Funk.”  Watch the video.	1

Robert Sebree/PET  Tia Mowry-Hardrict gave birth on May 5 but she’s kept her daughter under wraps…until now!  Today on her Facebook Watch series, Tia Mowry’s Quick Fix, the star revealed her second bundle of joy’s adorable little face and her name too. (Which husband Cory Hardrict picked out!)  “This is baby Cairo. Her name is Cairo Tiahna Hardrict. Cairo, it basically means victorious. My husband was in the air, flying. He always feels like he’s closer to his mother when he’s up in the air. He said when he was flying, he saw the letters A, I, R, in the sky. He said he wanted the baby’s name to have those letters. Tiahna is spelled T-I-A-H-N-A so it has Tia in there. Tiahna actually means follower of Christ. Also, Tiahna is one of the first African princesses so she’s our little princess here!”  The actress and The Oath actor announced that they were having baby number two in November 2017 and shared that they’d be welcoming a daughter in January. The couple who wed in April 2008, has a son, Cree Taylor.  ❤️❤️❤️❤️ A post shared by tiamowry (@tiamowry) on Nov 8, 2017 at 10:20am PST  Mowry-Hardrict had been vocal about her struggle with endometriosis and was in denial about pregnancy the second time around. She even admitted to taking about “20 pregnancy tests” before believing the good news.  While expecting, the 38-year-old basked in the joys of pregnancy by dancing as her baby bump grew, showed off darling maternity styles and had a bohemian themed baby shower that was full of love.  Since welcoming her daughter, the star has been honest about life post-partum including breastfeeding and the pressure to snap back after giving birth.  After giving birth, the actress teased fans on Instagram by selectively showing off her baby girl but now that we’ve finally met her and we’re already obsessed with her.  💕 A post shared by tiamowry (@tiamowry) on Jun 9, 2018 at 12:53pm PDT  Welcome to the world officially, baby Cairo!

Thirty Seconds to Mars arrived at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards ready to play their new single, but first, frontman Jared Leto used the stage to shout out a couple of rock’s fallen greats.  “Two artists that I had the absolute pleasure of touring with,” Leto began, speaking about none other than Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington, both of which passed away over the past three months. A somber Leto shared personal memories of both, beginning with Cornell, and how Bennington (a friend of the late Soundgarden/Audioslave singer) actually sang Leonard Cohen’s “Hallelujah” at his funeral.  On the Linkin Park vocalist (who committed suicide July 20), Leto remarked, “When I think about Chester, I see his face, which was always smiling. I think about his heart, which he wore on his sleeve. I think about how kindly he treated [Thirty Seconds to Mars]. I think about his wife and how incredibly he treated his six children.”  After that, he asked the Los Angeles crowd to get on its feet, and wouldn’t continue until it complied. “Reach out, share your thoughts, do not give up,” he implored those suffering like Cornell and Bennington. “There is always a way forward. The biggest breakthroughs in life lie just beyond the darkest days.”  To cap off the poignant moment, the VMAs’ big screen played a snippet of Linkin Park’s performance from the 2010 edition of the award show, their single “The Catalyst,” rocked out at Los Angeles’ Griffith Observatory.

"It's been over a year since Jhene Aiko filed for divorce from Dot Da Genius, but now, the divorce is officially final.  According to a report from TMZ, since the couple was only married for 11 months and had no kids together, it wasn't a messy process and the two were able to reach a financial settlement.  Rumors of the the singer's split from Dot came shortly after she locked lips with Big Sean onstage at Power 106's Powerhouse concert last year. Aiko reportedly filed for divorce in August 2016, citing irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split.  The split became ugly early on, as many fans assumed Aiko had cheated on Dot, while others assumed Dot had abused the singer. Aiko denied cheating on the producer, tweeting, ""Never let a man disrespect u in any way... I only cheated myself. so glad to be free from all the drugs, depression and confrontation.""  Dot also shot down any notions that he had harmed Aiko, writing on Instagram, “In light of public threats, false allegations and attempts to slander my name and character, I am compelled to speak up.""  He continued, “Because my nature is peaceful, I’ve been silent out of respect for all involved, and to maintain my privacy. However, I believe the truth must be heard, which is that I’ve never been violent or abusive towards any woman in my life. Such behavior is abhorrent to me and far from how I conduct myself. Moving forward, I will continue to focus on my family, friends and music, and soon enough the entire truth shall come to light.”  Since splitting from Dot Da Genius, Aiko and Big Sean have been happily dating and continue to collaborate on songs, including some from her new album Trip."	1
Spacey and Pearce played the co-leads in Curtis Hanson's 1997 LAPD neo-noir.  Guy Pearce and Kevin Spacey co-starred in Curtin Henson’s 1997 neo-noir film “L.A. Confidential,” and Pearce suggests in a new interview with Australian talk show host Andrew Denton that Spacey got inappropriate with him during production. Spacey has been accused of sexual harassment and abuse by serval men, including “Star Trek: Discovery” and “Rent” actor Anthony Rapp.  During the interview, Pearce was asked about Spacey’s history of abuse and working with the actor early in their careers. Pearce did not want to reveal too much about his experiences with Spacey, but he did imply nonprofessional behavior when he said, “Yeah. Tough one to talk about at the moment. Amazing actor, incredible actor. Mmm. Slightly difficult time with Kevin, yeah.”  Pearce followed the comment with the following remark, “He’s a handsy guy. Thankfully I was 29, and not 14.” According to Yahoo Entertainment, Denton’s audience could be heard gasping at Pearce’s revelation.  Monarchy/Regency/Kobal/Shutterstock  Popular on IndieWire  Pearce’s implication would not be the first time a high profile actor has come forward to reveal Spacey’s behavior on set. Gabriel Byrne said last December that Spacey’s “sexually inappropriate behavior” stopped production on “The Usual Suspects.” The film’s director, Bryan Singer, refuted the claim.  “I did not know honestly then the extent of his violence,” Byrne told The Sunday Times. “I mean, he was kind of a joke in that people would say, ‘That’s Kevin,’ but nobody really understood the depth of his predations. It was only years later that we began to understand that [filming] was closed down for a particular reason and that was because of inappropriate sexual behavior by Spacey.”  In the months since the first allegation against Spacey was made, the actor has remained entirely out of the spotlight. Spacey was fired from his Netflix series “House of Cards,” which will return for a final season with co-star Robin Wright in the lead role. The actor is still set to appear in the film “Billionaire Boys Club,” which opens in theaters August 17.  Sign Up: Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news!

"Sterling K. Brown and his wife, Ryan Michelle Bathe, first met at Stanford University.  Both of them are actors, and have even worked on This Is Us together.  The couple dated, but broke up for three-and-a-half years before reconnecting.  They were married in 2007, after being ""together solid since April 2004.""  Brown and Bathe have two sons together.  These days, Sterling K. Brown and Ryan Michelle Bathe are one of the cutest couples on every red carpet. During his acceptance speeches, Brown, who stars on NBC's hit drama This Is Us, has the sweetest things to say about Bathe. His wife is an actor herself, and has appeared in shows like Army Wives and Boston Legal. Though their marriage seems solid now, their relationship has had twists and turns that rival the drama played out on their respective TV shows. Here's exactly how the pair got together.  How Did Sterling K. Brown Meet His Wife?  Bathe and Brown first met while studying at Stanford University in 1998, where they lived in the same dorm and starred in plays together. Bathe recalled in an interview with People that she was wowed by his talent even then. ""I saw Sterling audition for Joe Turner's Come And Gone. We were both freshmen in college,"" she told the publication. ""I snuck in and I saw his audition, and I thought to myself, 'If this man can do this at 17 years old, my God. What could he do when he becomes a grown man?'""  Getty Images  They were friends first and bonded over their shared history. ""We found out that we were both from St. Louis. We didn't know that we were both from St. Louis, like, our parents went to rival high schools. We were born in the same hospital. Like, we were friends,"" Brown told Entertainment Tonight. ""She was dating somebody. Of course she was, she's gorgeous. So we were just buddies."" The relationship turned romantic, and they ended up dating on and off through college.  Why Did Sterling K. Brown and Ryan Michelle Bathe Break Up?  But it wasn't all romance from there. Bathe and Brown broke up for three and a half years before reconnecting. Brown said on The Talk that he had to work up a sweat to win her back. ""She was on a treadmill working out, and I had this epiphany. 'I have to go tell this woman she's the love of my life.' ... and she's like 'Well, I'm working out right now... I'm going to go on a run,'"" he told the hosts. ""She starts running through Koreatown, and I start running along with her. Brother had to work. But it was work well worthwhile.""  What Is Sterling K. Brown and Ryan Michelle Bathe's Marriage Like?  They were married in 2007, but their path to marriage was so dramatic, Brown thinks it would make a great movie. ""We need to actually put pen to paper and get it produced because people wouldn't believe it,"" he told ET. ""The multitude of ups and downs that we went through before we finally got together and figured it out. [We] have been together solid since April 2004, [but] all the stuff that happened before that, it's a good movie.""  The two have even acted together before. They both had roles on Army Wives, and Bathe was cast in a recurring role on This Is Us, too; she plays Yvette, the mother who confronts Rebecca about young Randall's hair and eventually befriends Jack and Rebecca. ""I love actors so much, I decided to marry one,"" Brown said during his acceptance speech at the 2018 SAG Awards. ""You're the best scene partner a brother's ever had.""  That said, though, they know one thing they can't do together, and that's rehearse. ""We've learned that there are certain minefields and pitfalls in our relationship, like a slalom, we just move right past them,"" Bathe told E! News. ""Rehearsing together is one of those things.""  Do Sterling K. Brown and Ryan Michelle Bathe Have Kids?  They have two sons together, Andrew, 6, and Amaré, 2. And Brown ended up having to help Bathe give birth to their oldest child, in a scene similar to the one Brown was in on This Is Us. ""My wife delivers quickly,"" Brown said on Live With Kel"	1

The 40-year-old rapper - who has had a longstanding friendship with the 39-year-old Ordinary People hitmaker - took to Twitter to share a screenshot of their conversation.  John began the message by urging the Famous hitmaker to 'reconsider aligning yourself with Trump.'  No phones allowed! Chrissy and Kim banded together with their damage control attempt, after Kanye posted a personal text exchange with friend John Legend in which he accused the singer of 'manipulating my free thought'  However Kanye was not very receptive for what the Oscar winner had to say as he wrote a biting response, screenshotted the conversation, and posted it online just minutes later.  It came after Kanye made waves on social media on Wednesday as he voiced his support for President Donald Trump during a lengthy Twitter tirade.  John has been very vocal about his distaste for the 45th president and reached out to his pal about the matter as he wrote: 'Hey it's JL. I hope you'll reconsider aligning yourself with Trump.  'You're way too powerful and influential to endorse who he is and what he stands for. As you know, what you say really means something to your fans.

So many people who love you feel so betrayed right now because they know the harm that Trump's policies cause, especially to people of color.  'Don't let this be part of your legacy. You're the greatest artist of our generation.'  However Kanye remained steadfast despite his close friend's pleas.  He wrote back: 'I love you John and I appreciate your thoughts. You bringing up my fans or my legacy is a tactic based on fear used to manipulate my free thought.'  'Think freely': It did not end there as Kanye posted the continuation of their conversation  Longtime pals: Kanye and John pictured together at Stevie Wonder's birthday back in May 2007  It did not end there as Kanye posted the continuation of their conversation as John urged him to: 'Think freely. Think with empathy and context too. Your words and actions have consequences. Much love.'  John even poked fun at Kanye for posting their private messages on the popular micro-blogging site as he took the opportunity to plug his latest track called A Good Night.

"Ariana Grande and a star-studded lineup of performers took the stage in Manchester, England, nearly two weeks after a suicide bomber killed 22 people outside a Grande concert at Manchester Arena. The concert raised money for those affected by the attack.  As Ariana Grande and fellow artists took the stage at the One Love Manchester concert Sunday, Piers Morgan offered a public apology to the singer.  The outspoken and acerbic British journalist and TV personality had criticized her for leaving the U.K. immediately after a suicide bomber killed 22 people and injured dozens more at her Manchester Arena show, instead of staying and visiting the wounded survivors.  Grande had returned to the U.S. to be with her family and flew back to England last week, where she did visit injured fans at the hospital ahead of the One Love Manchester concert, which she co-organized.  Pop Star Ariana Grande Visits Fans at Manchester Hospital  ""I misjudged you, @ArianaGrande &I apologize,"" he wrote on Twitter, alongside a screenshot of Grande embracing a child singer onstage after performing with her choir. ""You're an admirable young woman &this is a magnificent night. Respect. #OneLoveManchester.""      One Love Manchester Benefit Concert  Many people praised Morgan for apologizing and some expressed shock over his initial statements.  ""I thought Ariana Grande was wrong to fly off after #ManchesterAttack,"" Morgan tweeted earlier. ""But tonight she's putting on a fabulous show. #OneLoveManchester.""  Grande was joined onstage at the One Manchester Concert by the likes of Miley Cyrus, Coldplay, Justin Bieber, Katy Perry and the Black Eyed Peas, with whom she sang their breakout hit ""Where Is the Love?""  💛 A post shared by Ariana Grande (@arianagrande) on Jun 2, 2017 at 4:48pm PDT  'One Love': Stars, Fans Flock to Manchester Benefit Concert  Original Post: Piers Morgan Apologizes to Ariana Grande and Praises Manchester Benefit Concert  © Copyright E!

Just as Paramount/Skydance’s sci-fi adventure Annihilation was heating up in its word of mouth before its February 23 release, two advocacy groups this week — MANAA (Media Action Network for Asian Americans) and American Indians in Film and Television — took aim at the film for whitewashing its two leading characters, played by Natalie Portman and Jennifer Jason Leigh. This despite the fact Annihilation features an inclusive cast and is largely female-driven with Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, Sonya Miznuo and Tuva Novotny along with Oscar Isaac and Benedict Wong.  Alex Garland, who directed and adapted the first novel in Jeff VanderMeer’s Southern Reach trilogy, weighed in with a response to the criticism today:  “This is an awkward problem for me, because I think whitewashing is a serious and real issue, and I fully support the groups drawing attention to it. But the characters in the novel I read and adapted were not given names or ethnicities. I cast the film reacting only to the actors I met in the casting process, or actors I had worked with before. There was no studio pressure to cast white. The casting choices were entirely mine. As a middle-aged white man, I can believe I might at times be guilty of unconscious racism, in the way that potentially we all are. But there was nothing cynical or conspiratorial about the way I cast this movie.”  Annihilation centers on Lena (Portman), a biologist and expedition leader who ventures with a team into a secret environmental disaster area where events went sideways for her husband. In the first novel, the background of Portman’s character and that of Leigh’s government psychologist Dr. Ventress aren’t revealed. It’s not until the second book in the series, Authority, that we learn Portman’s character is of Asian descent, and that Leigh’s is half-Native American/half-Caucasian.  VanderMeer hasn’t commented about the recent whitewashing criticisms, but he has said on Twitter to fans that he “never expected or wanted a faithful adaptation from Garland — just a good one.”  MANAA board member Alieesa Badreshia blasted Garland in a statement this week saying: “He exploits the story but fails to take advantage of the true identities of each character. Hollywood rarely writes prominent parts for Asian American and American Indian characters, and those roles could’ve bolstered the careers of women from those communities.”  Echoed Sonny Skyhawk, founder of American Indians in Film and Television: “We are not surprised by the Whack-a-Mole diversity replacement that goes on; just when you finish objecting to one white-washed casting, another one pops up.”  The orgs’ gripes come in the wake of DreamWorks/Paramount’s $110 million manga adaptation Ghost in the Shell last year, which was dinged for its casting of Scarlett Johansson in what was originally a Japanese role. Other pics faulted by critics for their whitewashing include Marvel’s Doctor Strange and Cameron Crowe’s Aloha, the latter of which cast Emma Stone as a person of one-quarter Hawaiian and one-quarter Chinese descent.  Portman learned at the pic’s junket, as revealed in a Yahoo! interview, that her character was originally of Asian descent in the book.  “We need more representation of Asians on film, of Hispanics on film, of Blacks on film, and women and particularly women of color, Native Americans — I mean, we just don’t have enough representation,” the Oscar-winning Black Swan actress said in response to being questioned about the controversy.  “These categories like ‘white’ and ‘nonwhite’ — they’re imagined classifications but have real-life consequences. … And I hope that begins to change, because I think everyone is becoming more conscious of it, which hopefully will make change,” she added.  Said Leigh, “There should be more parts for everyone and more diversity in all films.”  Tracking currently has Annihilation opening to between $10M-$15M. Those figures could grow, and given the pic’s heat, Netflix has the most to gai	1

"Brad Pitt has been caught nearly kissing Marion Cotillard.  What sort of wrench will this throw into Pitt's divorce proceedings with Angelina Jolie?  Will she use the image below against her estranged husband in her plans to secure full legal custody of the stars' six children?  What impact will this development have on Pitt's global popularity?  The answers, in order, are:  No wrench. No way for Jolie to use this photo against Pitt. And no impact at all on Pitt's standing with millions of fans around the globe.  How come? Because the image in question is a movie poster!  HA! Got ya!  Sorry, but we had to.  The first promotional poster for Pitt and Cotillard’s upcoming World War II romantic drama, Allied, has hit the Internet.  And it's only worth noting because a rumor circulated soon after Jolie filed to divorce Pitt that he actually carried on an affair with Cotillard.  This chatter was based on nothing but the fact that Pitt and Cotillard are starring together as husband and wife in this film and were probably caught looking cozy on set together.  For the camera, that is, and nothing more.  Of course, it is widely believed that Pitt got together with Jolie on the set of Mr. and Mrs. Smith way back in the day, ending his marriage to Jennifer Aniston as a result of this new relationship.  So we do understand where people got the idea that Pitt might bond with a female co-star.  But Cotillard did a masterful job of shooting down any affair allegations before they built up too much momentum.  In a very straightforward Instagram post, the French actress responded to these silly rumors as follows last month:  This is going to be my first and only reaction to the whirlwind news that broke 24 hours ago and that I was swept up into.  I am not used to commenting on things like this nor taking them seriously but as this situation is spiraling and affecting people I love, I have to speak up.  Firstly, many years ago, I met the man of my life, father of our son and of the baby we are expecting. He is my love, my best friend, the only one that I need.  Secondly to those who have indicated that I am devastated, I am very well thank you. This crafted conversation isn't distressing. And to all the media and the haters who are quick to pass judgment, I sincerely wish you a swift recovery.  Finally, I do very much wish that Angelina and Brad, both whom I deeply respect, will find peace in this very tumultuous moment. With all my love Marion.  There you have it, right? Case very much closed.  Allies opens in theaters on November 23.  It will be interesting to see if Pitt's divorce helps the movie do well... or prompts the movie to tank at the box office.  As for the latest regarding the Divorce Heard 'Round the World, a recent report suggests that Jolie is having second thoughts about her legal split.  ""Angelina didn't realize how much she would miss him but now that Brad is out of her daily life, she misses his sense of humor and seeing him everyday,"" an anonymous insider tells Hollywood Life.  Believe this at your own discretion, however.  We're pretty sure the marriage is doomed."	0

"In fashion as in life, Kristen Stewart has always challenged gender norms with her androgynous beauty – which makes her the perfect face of Chanel's new fragrance, Gabrielle, inspired by the legendary founder of the couture house. But she is also very much her own woman, as independent-spirited when it comes to fame and feminism as she has been in facing down Donald Trump.  Kristen wears Chanel on the newsstand cover  Read highlights from the interview below:  On being in love:  ""I've been deeply in love with everyone I've dated. Did you think I was faking it? I've always really embraced a duality. And really, truly, believed in it and never felt confused or struggling. I just didn't like getting made fun of.""  On dating men again:  ""Yeah, totally. Definitely… Some people aren't like that. Some people know that they like grilled cheese and they'll eat it every day for the rest of their lives. I want to try everything. If I have grilled cheese once I'm like, 'That was cool, what's next?'""  Kristen with then-boyfriend Robert Pattinson in 2011, and with current girlfriend Stella Maxwell in June 2017. Getty Images  On fame:  ""Fame is valued quite ridiculously. So then there's this idea that you're beholden in some way, and I resent that. And it comes across like I'm ungrateful or something but, actually, I just find it weird to talk to the general public as a whole. Like, you can relate to a person, you can relate to an individual, but addressing the world at large is something that just perplexes me.""  On whether she suffers from 'Resting Bitch Face':  ""Completely. I'm really not introverted - I'm just not acting all the time, which is what it would take to look like how people expect famous people to behave.""  ""Men cannot say bitch anymore, I'm sorry. Say something different. Say, 'You're rude,' say, 'You're a dick,' whatever. Just to say, 'Oh that bitch.' You can't say that because there's nothing I could say to you, there's no retort that would be equal to that, therefore it's demeaning and literally on par with... something homophobic or something racist.""  On life as a woman in the United States, post Trump:  ""It's obviously terrible what's happening but at the same time, it feels good to be part of a wider female community that is finally standing up for itself. I've never felt such a strong sense of community. So it's brought us together. The catalyst for this is regrettable, obviously, it's shitty. But at the same time I think that you need something to stir things up in order to get people to come together and define their opinions and force them to be heard.""  Kristen wears Chanel, photographed by Tom Craig  On her tomboy style:  She used to dress as ""a total tomboy"" and it was only at school that she realised it was ""not the most normal thing. Not all little girls are that way. And it actually really hurt my feelings, like badly. Like, I remember being in the sixth grade [aged 11] and [people would say] 'Kristen looks like a man. You're a boy', or whatever, and I was so offended, horrified and embarrassed. Now I look back on it and I'm like, 'Girl, be proud of that!'""  Everything shifted when Stewart hit puberty and grew her hair long. Suddenly she was accepted as one of the pretty girls ""and I was like, 'Fuck all of you!'""  Watch below as Kristen explores Coco Chanel's apartment following her cover shoot:  The September issue of Harper's Bazaar is available on newsstands from 4 August."	0

"Movie stars are supposedly nothing like you and me. They're svelte, glamorous, self-­possessed. They wear dresses we can't afford and live in houses we can only dream of. Yet it turns out that—in the most painful and personal ways—movie stars are more like you and me than we ever knew.  In 1997, just before Ashley Judd's career took off, she was invited to a meeting with Harvey Weinstein, head of the starmaking studio Miramax, at a Beverly Hills hotel. Astounded and offended by Weinstein's attempt to coerce her into bed, Judd managed to escape. But instead of keeping quiet about the kind of encounter that could easily shame a woman into silence, she began spreading the word.  ""I started talking about Harvey the minute that it happened,"" Judd says in an interview with TIME. ""Literally, I exited that hotel room at the Peninsula Hotel in 1997 and came straight downstairs to the lobby, where my dad was waiting for me, because he happened to be in Los Angeles from Kentucky, visiting me on the set. And he could tell by my face—to use his words—that something devastating had happened to me. I told him. I told everyone.""  TIME  She recalls one screenwriter friend telling her that Weinstein's behavior was an open secret passed around on the whisper network that had been furrowing through Hollywood for years. It allowed for people to warn others to some degree, but there was no route to stop the abuse. ""Were we supposed to call some fantasy attorney general of moviedom?"" Judd asks. ""There wasn't a place for us to report these experiences.""  Finally, in October—when Judd went on the record about Weinstein's behavior in the New York Times , the first star to do so—the world listened. (Weinstein said he ""never laid a glove"" on Judd and denies having had nonconsensual sex with other accusers.)  When movie stars don't know where to go, what hope is there for the rest of us? What hope is there for the janitor who's being harassed by a co-worker but remains silent out of fear she'll lose the job she needs to support her children? For the administrative assistant who repeatedly fends off a superior who won't take no for an answer? For the hotel housekeeper who never knows, as she goes about replacing towels and cleaning toilets, if a guest is going to corner her in a room she can't escape?  Like the ""problem that has no name,"" the disquieting malaise of frustration and repression among postwar wives and homemakers identified by Betty Friedan more than 50 years ago, this moment is born of a very real and potent sense of unrest. Yet it doesn't have a leader, or a single, unifying tenet. The hashtag #MeToo (swiftly adapted into #BalanceTonPorc, #YoTambien, #Ana_kaman and many others), which to date has provided an umbrella of solidarity for millions of people to come forward with their stories, is part of the picture, but not all of it.  This reckoning appears to have sprung up overnight. But it has actually been simmering for years, decades, centuries. Women have had it with bosses and co-workers who not only cross boundaries but don't even seem to know that boundaries exist. They've had it with the fear of retaliation, of being blackballed, of being fired from a job they can't afford to lose. They've had it with the code of going along to get along. They've had it with men who use their power to take what they want from women. These silence breakers have started a revolution of refusal, gathering strength by the day, and in the past two months alone, their collective anger has spurred immediate and shocking results: nearly every day, CEOs have been fired, moguls toppled, icons disgraced. In some cases, criminal charges have been brought.  Emboldened by Judd, Rose McGowan and a host of other prominent accusers, women everywhere have begun to speak out about the inappropriate, abusive and in some cases illegal behavior they've faced. When multiple harassment claims bring down a charmer like former Today show host Matt Lauer, women who thought they"	1
As the reality TV show Keeping Up With The Kardashians is set to air it’s 10th anniversary season, the fans are going crazy as the Kardashian-Jenners released a very fresh, fierce and nostalgic teaser.  The video starts with the line “No matter how far they go, they never go alone” while showing old home video clips of the famous family and Momager Kris Jenner flying a helicopter.  The slogan ‘Keep It Kardashian’ flashes on the screen as Kourtney is shown lounging near the swimming pool while a pool guy is checking her out.  Khloe displays her incredibly fit physique while working out in the gym. Kendall runs off backstage just before she was set to strut the catwalk. Kylie is pulled over and given a ticket before speeding off with her lavish orange Lamborghini.

Kirby became famous on Instagram for flawlessly Photoshopping himself onto Kendall’s photos.  The last part of the video shows the KarJenners being brought together on the set.

Her sisters pushed her to side the same way they did before.  In the recreation of the original opening credits, Bruce Jenner and Rob Kardashian are noticeably missing. The issues they have with the KarJenner family are probably one of the reasons they are out.  Scott Disick, Kourtney’s ex-boyfriend, is reported to be fired after the season 14 of the E! show.

    Sending him love! Bob Harper revealed the surprising star that reached out to him following his heart attack during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen on Tuesday, April 11. Watch the video above!  “Howard Stern. Him and [his wife] Beth, they reached out to me,” Harper, 51, told host Cohen, 48, and fellow guest Rachel Dratch. “Then Howard sent me a video of naked men doing yoga. Beth was like, ‘You’re gonna give him another heart attack!’ I love him.”  When asked if he received well-wishes from any Biggest Loser stars, he added: “I heard from almost everyone.”  As previously reported, the personal trainer stopped breathing after he finished a workout with friends at the gym on February 12. He was given CPR and was rushed to a nearby hospital.  “When I heard that you had cardiac arrest I didn’t know that meant that you technically died,” Cohen said on Tuesday night. “I technically died,” Harper replied. “There was a piece of paper from the doctor that said, ‘Cause of death: cardiac arrest.’ That’s a wake up call!”  Earlier this month, Harper said on the Today show that he had a “6 percent survival rate” and that he didn’t take prior warning signs seriously enough.  “I fainted one time in the gym, I started having these dizzy spells and I just kind of overlooked them,” he recalled to Cohen. “[I] just adapted, which was just the dumbest [thing to do]. I kicked myself over and over again about that.”	1
    Huh? While attending a New York Fashion Week event on Friday, September 8, Jim Carrey gave a very strange interview.  The 55-year-old actor began by circling around E! News host Catt Sadler at Harper’s Bazaar’s party celebrating Icons by Carine Roitfeld at the Plaza in New York City, and it only got more awkward from there.  See the Stars at New York Fashion Week 2017  “There’s no meaning to any of this,” Carrey explained of his attendance at the star-studded event. “So I wanted to find the most meaningless thing that I could come to and join and here I am. You got to admit, it’s completely meaningless.”  When Sadler added that the party was celebrating icons, Carrey replied, “Celebrating icons? Boy, that’s just the absolute lowest aiming possibility that we could come up with … I don’t believe that you exist but there is a wonderful fragrance in the air.” The comedian then broke into a James Brown impression.  “I don’t believe in personalities. I believe that peace lies beyond personalities, beyond invention and disguise, beyond the red ‘S’ you wear on your chest, that makes bullets bounce off,” he continued, referencing a 2014 commencement speech he gave Maharishi University of Management in Iowa.  Sadler tried to switch topics and complimented Carrey’s bright, patterned suit. ”I didn’t get dressed up,” he replied. “There is no me. There’s just things happening. It’s not our world … we don’t matter.”  Other guests at the party included Selena Gomez and The Weeknd, Gigi Hadid, Nicki Minaj and Kim Kardashian.  Carrey also went on a similar rant recently while he was a special guest in Michael Moore’s Broadway show, The Terms of My Surrender, on Thursday, September 7.  According to an onlooker, Carrey said that “human beings don’t matter” when Moore asked him what people can do to make a difference in the world.  “He continued to say, ‘We consume ourselves with food and sex because we don’t want to drown in a river of our own tears,'” the eyewitness exclusively tells Us Weekly. “For a pretty simple question it got really weird and deep, at times not making much sense. Even Michael Moore joked that it got awkward and ran long after Jim had left the stage.”  For the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly’s YouTube Page.	1

"After being reported missing by her sister, Julia Kebbel shared that her bipolar disorder influenced her and her dog going missing in January.  More than a month after actress Arielle Kebbel announced that her sister, Julia, had been found safe after being missing for two weeks, Julia took to Instagram to explain what led to her disappearance, revealing that she suffers from bipolar disorder.  Using Arielle Kebbel's Instagram account, the director of promotions at NBCUniversal wrote her story captioned under a photo of herself looking at a sunset on a cliffside. ""My name is Julia Kebbel. I have bipolar disorder and suffered a severe episode at the end of January 2018,"" the post read. ""It led to me experiencing a psychotic break from reality, during which time, I went missing with my dog, Cindy.""  Julia thanked her loved ones and ""good Samaritans"" who helped her during the frightening ordeal, also revealing that she is ""grateful for the treatment and care"" she is receiving for her mental illness.  ""I would like to thank every person involved in the search for us for your incredible outpouring of support and love,"" she added. ""On my road to recovery, I am hoping to help raise awareness of mental health disorders, including fighting the stigmatization of these illnesses that affect so many. I proudly stand with you. — With love and gratitude, Julia Kebbel.""  In a Feb. 3 Instagram post, Kebbel sent out an alert that her sister had gone missing in the Silver Lake area of Los Angeles while walking her chocolate Labrador retriever. The actress went on to file an official missing persons report with the LAPD. Two weeks later, Kebbel shared the news that her sister and dog had been found.  ""It is with great joy and relief that I share the wonderful news that my sister, Julia, and her dog, Cindy, have been found safe,"" the actress wrote on Instagram. ""While we do ask for privacy at this time, my family and I want to thank everyone for all of your love and support over the past two weeks. We are so grateful to every single person who helped spread the word and joined us in our search. We would also like to thank the Los Angeles Police Department, KlaasKIDS, SERT Ministries and Anonymity Rescue for their efforts in bringing Julia home."""	1
"Two years ago, Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth were still playing coy about being back together. Hemsworth even went so far as to deny to the press they were re-engaged, despite Cyrus wearing his ring. But time and going Instagram official must change all, because Cyrus very openly spoke about her life living with Hemsworth to Jimmy Kimmel last night.  She touched on the viral videos they've shared of Hemsworth pranking her, which is apparently a regular occurrence for the two. ""Yes, constantly [Liam likes to scare me],"" Cyrus said. About that last video he posted this week, she explained her, ""F*ck you, I hate you, I was already scared"" reaction.  ""I was, I was already scared,"" she said. ""That was what was so annoying. I was putting—and this was bad, I know that it’s May, and I was putting our Christmas decorations away finally. I like lights, and I like shiny things and elves, and they just live for like a whole summer. So now it was time, May 1, Christmas has gotta go."" Kimmel expressed his shock she still had the decorations up. ""They’re so cute. Santa makes me feel safe.""  ""So I was already in this really creepy basement and so I was coming up to say ‘Oh my god, that basement is so scary,’ and then he jumped out at the worst time,"" Cyrus continued. She dodged Kimmel's question of whether she's bothered by it or actually okay with it. ""I just don’t know why I haven’t caught onto this is all—but I don’t know he’s around every corner. He’s around a lot of corners,"" she said. And she can't get him back. ""I’m obviously very loud so I’m not good at scaring people. because I’m like—"" Cyrus hiss-laughs manically, ""And he’s like ‘I can hear you back there behind the door.’""  She revealed to Kimmel that yes, they're living together, and Hemsworth also calls her a hoarder. ""I’m very, okay, I would say I’m a clean person but I’m also am a little bit of a hoarder. He calls it hoarding, I call it collecting. There’s a very small—there’s a thin line that divides hoarding and collecting, [and it] is keeping things in the package. So having things in the boxes, so for example, I have saved for probably 15 years now a bag of peanuts from Southwest airlines, but they’re still in the bag so that is collecting. Loose peanuts, that’s hoarding. Collecting is in the package because they mean something to me. [The peanuts], they represent the beginning of this life for me because I was on my way to LA for the first time to audition for Hannah Montana.""  And finally, Hemsworth got her hooked on video games. ""This is really random, you’d never expect this, but Liam was playing the UFC [fighting] video game, and I told him how dumb it was until the controller got in my hand one time, and now it’s my favorite thing in the world is smoking pot and playing UFC video games. It’s not very productive.""  Because this is a Miley Cyrus interview, she also touched on her pot use these days: still none. ""I want to be but no, [I’m no longer smoking]."" Kimmel pointed out pot is now legal in California. ""That’s the way I—I’m a rebel. Because I am very focused on what I’m working on right now and I think I also think it is the most magical, amazing—it’s my first and true love, but it’s not for me at this time in my life, but I’m sure there will be a day I will happily indulge."	0

"Johnson also has a daughter, Simone Alexandra, from his first marriage. He and his high school sweetheart, Dany Garcia, wed in 1997 and split up a decade later, though she continues to serve as his manager.  In August 2019, Johnson tied the knot with his longtime girlfriend, singer/music producer Lauren Hashian. The two are parents to daughters Jasmine Lia (b. December 2015) and Tiana Gia (b. April 2018).  Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson was born into a professional wrestling family in 1972. An injury ended his college football career, so he entered the ring with the World Wrestling Federation. As ""The Rock,"" he famously feuded with wrestler Steve Austin and won the WWF/WWE Heavyweight title numerous times. Johnson then parlayed his wrestling fame into a film career, appearing in projects like 2001's The Mummy Returns and 2010's Tooth Fairy. Later projects include the HBO series Ballers and leading roles in The Fast and the Furious and Jumanji franchises.  Movies and TV  'Scorpion King'  Outside the wrestling ring, The Rock launched a successful acting career, dropping the stage name and simply going by Dwayne Johnson. He first made a big splash as the Scorpion King, a supernatural bad guy, in 2001's The Mummy Returns. Johnson returned to this role the following year for The Scorpion King. Trying his hand at comedy, he appeared in 2005's Be Cool with John Travolta and Uma Thurman and 2007's The Game Plan.  'Driver,' 'Fast & Furious' Franchise  Johnson's acting career to continued to thrive through his appearances in such films as Driver (2010) and Fast & Furious 6 (2013). In 2014, he starred as the titular strong man in Hercules. Johnson also returned to wrestling from time to time, including a 2014 appearance with Hulk Hogan and Stone Cold Steve Austin at WrestleMania 30.  HBO's 'Ballers'  In 2015, Johnson dominated the big screen with two big action films. He appeared in Furious Seven and starred in San Andreas. Johnson also debuted his first dramatic comedy series that same year, playing Spencer Strasmore, a retired pro footballer turned financial planner, on Ballers.  'Central Intelligence,' 'Moana,' 'Baywatch,' 'Jumanji'  In 2016, after teaming up with Kevin Hart for the action-comedy Central Intelligence, Johnson voiced the demigod Maui for the Disney animated hit Moana. He was a busy man in 2017, taking on starring roles in The Fate of the Furious, a big-screen adaptation of the 1990s lifeguard series Baywatch and Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle.  'Skyscraper,' 'Rampage,' 'Hobbs & Shaw'  The good vibes continued into 2018, with Jumanji racking up the ticket sales en route to becoming the actor's highest-grossing film to date. He also managed to stand out during the blitz of advertising accompanying the Super Bowl in February, debuting a trailer for the movie Skyscraper, in which he partakes in death-defying stunts with a prosthetic leg.  That same day, Johnson announced he would be hosting a 10-episode unscripted competition show, The Titan Games, to ""create a platform that gave everyday people the opportunity to change their lives and do something extraordinary.""  Next up for the action star was Rampage, based on the popular 1980s arcade game, which hit theaters a few months before the July release of Skyscraper.  Johnson returned to his wrestling roots by appearing as himself in Fighting with My Family (2019), based on the true story of female wrestling champion Saraya ""Paige"" Bevis. Later that year, he was back in action mode with the Fast & Furious spinoff Hobbs & Shaw, alongside Jason Statham.  Off the Screen  In 2017, buzz began generating over Johnson's rumored plan to run for president in 2020. After playing coy for much of the year, the wrestler-turned-actor finally confirmed the rumors in December, telling Ellen DeGeneres, ""I’m seriously considering it, yes.""  Johnson has also opened up about some of his early-life struggles, including his family's eviction from their Hawaii home when he was just 14. He told the UK p"	1

It appears there's drama at the American Idol judges table already.  Katy Perry, who will be joined by Luke Bryant and Lionel Richie in hosting the revamped competition series, appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Monday to promote the show. During the appearance she told host Jimmy Kimmel she and Luke are thick as thieves, but it seems there's a rift between them and their 68-year-old co-judge.  'We respect him just about as much as his kids respect him. Which is not a lot,' the Roar singer said while appearing on the late night show.  Katy Perry fired shots at American Idol co-host Lionel Richie during Jimmy Kimmel Live!  The comment appears to refer to something the musician previously made about his youngest daughter, Sofia Richie, dating Scott Disick. It's been widely reported that Lionel doesn't approve of his 19-year-old daughter's relationship with the troubled 34-year-old.  Katy's jabs didn't stop there, however. Speaking with the Jimmy Kimmel Live! host she nitpicked the way Lionel critiques American Idol contestants. The award-winning musician said Lionel often recalls working with music legends in long-winded stories comparable to 'Ted Talks'.  Katy doesn't just make snide remarks behind Lionel's back, though. She and her country musician co-judge, Luke, have been known to play a prank or two on the legendary musician, according to her Jimmy Kimmel appearance. She revealed on the show that they put whoopee cushions on his seat when he stands up to provide feedback to competitors.  'We're ruining his legacy,' she said.  Before American Idol fans get too bummed about this on-set beef, it's worth noting that Katy also said during her appearance that Lionel is actually like 'an uncle' to her and her fellow judge.  'He's an uncle you want in your house telling you all these wonderful historical stories and he does have some tea but we can't put that on TV,' she said.  Although there may be no actual feud on the set of American Idol, there's plenty of other drama rumored to be going down behind the judging table.  According to TMZ, Katy's left American Idol executives 'frustrated' with her repeated late arrivals on the set during auditions. Per the publication's report, she's 'almost always late' by about 10 or 15 minutes.  Producers are also said to be worried about a lack of 'comedic tension' on the show. The outlet reported that the panel are 'not at each other's throats, either in a serious or runny way', which has created worries about ratings.  American Idol premieres Sunday, March 11, 2018 at 8pm ET on ABC.	0
Fox Home Entertainment  Happy early Father's Day! (June 17th, to those of you who aren't paying attention; don't worry, dad has probably lost track too.) Following a box-office run where it made just over its budget with a $33 million gross, Death Wish 2018 is coming home digitally on 4K Ultra HD May 22nd, and then Blu-ray/DVD/VOD June 5th. It's all in good time to pay tribute to your dad by letting him imagine he'd be an action hero on your behalf, if circumstances ever arose.  The Blu-ray will include a commentary track by director Eli Roth and producer Roger Birnbaum, a grindhouse-style trailer, a featurette focusing on Roth's direction, extended scenes featuring deejays Mancow and Sway, and deleted scenes with optional Roth/Birnbaum commentary. I'm pleased to premiere one of those scenes right here. It takes place shortly after Paul Kersey (Willis) has had an uncomfortable run-in at a school sporting event for his daughter:  You can see why it didn't quite make the final cut--it feels like it's over-telling you Paul is a pacifist rather than showing you, and frankly nobody is going into this movie with any doubts about how things end up. As an audience member, you're waiting for him to get pushed over the line and do what Bruce Willis does, and it's a waste of time to take too long establishing the line itself.  It'll be interesting to see what else got deleted, though--perhaps there was an earlier cut with more ambiguity, one that played against Roth's natural instincts for grindhouse exploitation fare. Really, though, if you want something less gung-ho, watch the Charles Bronson version. The remake is unapologetic righteous fury, and will be best enjoyed if you know that going in.	0
"By Carolyn Hsu | April 02, 2018  Real Housewives of Beverly Hills star Brandi Glanville recently took to YouTube to explain why half her mouth doesn’t move when she talks.  In the 12-minute video, Glanville reveals that she had suffered third-degree burns from a laser hair removal treatment gone wrong, causing “nerve damage” and “scar tissue,” and resulting her in inability to “talk straight.”  ""Everyone wants to know why my top lip doesn't move. You can see it right here. It’s a little white circle,” Glanville says in the video. “I had laser hair removal on my upper lip, oh gosh, 2009, maybe 2008, and I got a third-degree burn. And my face on the right side doesn't move the way my face on the left side moves.”  You May Also Like: This Botched Laser Hair Removal Proves It's a Treatment You Should Take Seriously  Needless to say, with laser hair removal being such a sought-after treatment, we were a little unnerved (ha!) to hear of this potentially paralyzing side effect. We tapped a couple facial plastic surgeons to get a better understanding of facial anatomy.  “Timeline-wise, it's not clear when the facial paralysis started after laser hair removal. However, while anything can happen, it would be unusual for facial paralysis to result from laser treatments, as the facial nerve is usually deeper to the level of the burn,” explains Beverly Hills, CA facial plastic surgeon, Kimberly Lee, MD. “With deeper burns, sensory nerve endings can be affected, which can lead to numbness. The facial nerve is a motor nerve that is deeper and more robust than sensory nerves. To affect this nerve, the burn would have to be quite deep and substantial and would have to be located in the course of the nerve itself.”  New York facial plastic surgeon Matthew White, MD agrees that while laser hair removal certainly isn’t risk-free, it’s not likely to cause facial paralysis. “The lasers used for hair removal can’t penetrate deeply enough to damage the facial nerves directly,” he explains. “However, a laser could reactivate a virus, which can lead to Bell’s Palsy, [a condition that does cause paralysis].”  Bottom line: While it’s not so clear-cut what might have happened, Glanville’s experience is a reminder that all cosmetic procedures come with some risk of side effects. Seeing a qualified professional is crucial to ensuring you get the best results."	1
"Bruce Jenner is reportedly upset that American reality television star Kim Kardashian is treating her daughter North West like an ""accessory.""  According to Hollywood Life, the 65-year-old former Olympian is against the 34-year-old Keeping Up With The Kardashians star taking the 19-month-old toddler around the world, including in the front row at fashion shows.  ""He wants North to be a kid. To go to kid things,"" an insider said. ""She has no business being at a fashion show and he's appalled that Kim sometimes drags her around like some sort of an accessory.""  ""He doesn't appreciate how every time he turns around he sees his granddaughter's face plastered on magazines and websites. He hates it and doesn't want her to be exploited the way she is,"" the source added.  This comes after North threw tantrums twice during the New York Fashion Week.  The tiny tot burst into tears at father Kanye West's show with Adidas and the toddler also cried at the Alexander Wang runway show.  Meanwhile, it was previously reported that Kardashian feels North should not be banned from attending high profile events just ""because she's a baby""."	0
Married life is so wonderful that Hugh Grant thinks he should have jumped the broom much earlier in life.  “It’s really nice, I can’t pretend it isn’t,” the British actor, 57, shared Wednesday on “Today.”  “I should have done it before,” he said. “I’m just lucky. I’m lucky. I’ve got a great wife. I love her.”  Grant tied the knot with Anna Eberstein, 39, in May, bringing his wild bachelor days to an end.  They exchanged vows in a very small ceremony in Chelsea area of London, reports The Sun.  Grant and Eberstein, who’ve been together for six years, have three kids together, five-year-old John, a daughter whose name hasn’t been made public and a baby born this spring, whose name is also not known.  He has two other kids, Felix and Tabitha, from a previous relationship with Tinglan Hong.  He says traveling with his troop of five is “unspeakable.”  “And then you go through that moral torment – do I actually travel with them or do I make an excuse that they have to go with their mom or a nanny,” he quipped.  This story originally appeared in the New York Post.	1
"Perhaps they should call it the Can't Film Festival this year. As the legendary cinema competition opened today on the French Riviera, there are some new rules that celebrities, attendees and studios will have to follow.  First among them—quelle horreur!—selfies are no longer allowed on the red carpet. But given how many paparazzi descend on the Croisette each year, getting a photo to prove you attended, shouldn't be that hard to come by. Next, there will be no press screenings in advance of the premieres, a change that could actually be an improvement as critics will not be able to influence negative opinions of films until an actual audience has seen it. (Presumably, this will prevent some early booing.) And the final change is a ban on Netflix films, which was announced last year but which will be implemented in 2018. The streaming company can still submit films to the festival, but no movie will be eligible in the main competition unless a studio commits to a French theatrical release.  Among the buzziest movies that Cate Blanchett, jury president of the main competition, and her fellow jurors (including Kristen Stewart, Lea Seydoux and director Ava Duvernay) will be judging are BlacKkKlansman, Spike Lee's drama about a black detective (played by John David Washington, son of Denzel) who infiltrates the Ku Klux Klan and eventually heads up a local chapter.  Everybody Knows, a Spanish-language thriller starring Javier Bardem and Penelope Cruz, that opened the festival and brought out lots of celebrities, including Julianne Moore, Benicio Del Toro, Chloe Sevigny and director Martin Scorsese.  And one of the true treats for cinephiles is the return of the French New Wave legend Jean-Luc Godard. The now 87-year-old auteur—who helped shut down the festival in 1968 in sympathy with protests in Paris—returns with an experimental film called The Image Book.  Among the many controversies the festival will also have to navigate this year is the #MeToo movement. Not only was Harvey Weinstein a ubiquitous figure at Cannes in the past, but the festival's record of supporting women directors has not exactly been strong. Despite the fact that Blanchett is head of the jury, only three films competing for the Palme d'Or were directed by women.  ""They are not there because of their gender,"" Blanchett said at the festival's opening news conference. ""They are there because of the quality of their work. We will assess them as filmmakers, as we should."" She continued, ""Would I like to have more women displayed? Absolutely. But we are dealing with what we have this year. Our job as industry members away from this festival is to help with change."""	1

Anne Hathaway and Josh Gad had a laugh on social media Saturday after Gad excluded her from a throwback post.  The 37-year-old actor shared a shot in which he was posed with Jake Gyllenhaal on the set of their 2010 romantic comedy Love & Other Drugs, which also co-starred Hathaway.

Harvey Weinstein celebrated his 66th birthday on March 19, and Rose McGowan marked the occasion by sharing a video message on her official Twitter page in which she wishes the disgraced studio executive “happy fucking birthday.” McGowan has accused Weinstein of rape and detailed the alleged encounter in her memoir “BRAVE” earlier this year.  “Happy birthday, Harvey Weinstein,” McGowan said to the camera in a close-up. “I told you we’d be coming. I told you 20 years ago if I heard of you doing this to another girl or woman we would come for you — I would come for you. Happy fucking birthday. We win.”  A message to Harvey Weinstein on his birthday #RoseArmy pic.twitter.com/YP61rONbjg — rose mcgowan (@rosemcgowan) March 20, 2018  According to McGowan’s book, the sexual abuse occurred at the 1997 Sundance Film Festival. McGowan went to Weinstein’s hotel suite thinking the two would talk about her career, but he pulled her into a room with a jacuzzi and took off her clothes as soon as she arrived. Weinstein allegedly proceeded to sit her on the side of the jacuzzi, where he forcibly performed oral sex on her while masturbating.  McGowan has been one of the most outspoken voices against Weinstein throughout the #MeToo movement. His former studio The Weinstein Company officially filed for bankruptcy on March 20, releasing all employees from the Non-Disclosure Agreements they signed while working under Weinstein.

"Adam Rippon and Mirai Nagasu arrive on the red carpet for the Academy Awards on March 4 in Los Angeles.

File Photo by Richard Ellis/UPI | License Photo  Adam Rippon of the United States competes at the Pyeongchang 2018 Winter Olympics at the Gangneung Ice Arena in Gangneung, South Korea. File Photo by Richard Ellis/UPI | License Photo  Dec. 17 (UPI) -- A long friendship with the frozen floor has melted into something else for Adam Rippon.  The 2018 Pyeongchang Winter Olympics sensation has decided to step away from competition and step into the unknown of an acting career. He says it's a scary road but also exciting.  ""My relationship with the ice is totally different now,"" Rippon told UPI. ""It used to be my job. It would be everything that my whole world was around. Now when I get on the ice it's a chance for me to kinda zone out and enjoy. It's my personal time now. It kinda brings me back to those moments when I first started skating and why I fell in love with skating in the first place.""  Rippon's agent might be one of the busiest in the business. Booking the bronze medalist for Dancing with the Stars, scores of interviews and even a recent gig on Will & Grace.  The 29-year-old proved to be a trailblazer, becoming the first openly gay U.S. man to medal at a Winter Games. He was also the first openly gay U.S. male skater to compete at an Olympics.  But that past is written.  ""I think I am really lucky because I have a lot of cool opportunities and I'm able to kind of take advantage of everything that is around me,"" said Rippon, who has also become a spokesman for DayQuil and NyQuil Severe with VapoCOOL.  ""I feel like I'm trying to take every situation and see what I like because I have been so focused on one career for 20 years and had the blinders on and didn't think or focus on anything else and it's just a chance for me now to kind of take those experiences, see what I like and I do want to reinvent myself.  ""I want to find something that I'm just as passionate at as I was with skating. That I can put 100 percent of myself in and just be my best everyday. Because I love that grind with skating but I think I felt that after the Olympics at 28 it felt like the perfect time for me to step away.""  In the chaos of opportunities, Rippon has to remind himself to stay grateful and tell himself that feelings of being scared are ""totally normal."" He uses a strong cast of friends and family to keep himself grounded.  He is working on a book that discusses those relationships and more. Rippon -- who became a household name to many at the Winter Games -- said there is still a lot that people don't know about him.  ""I don't think I'm going to say anything that's going to shock the [expletive] out of people,"" he said. ""I think that it will be interesting because I come from a small town. My childhood isn't very typical.""  Rippon moved away from home when he was 13 or 14 years old to pursue figure skating. He moved in with his teacher part time in order to take lessons daily.  ""There are a lot of things that aren't very normal. But it was part of my normal and I think that it is a really interesting chance for me to share that and I kind of tell it though my voice. Because I think it's important for me to tell those serious stories but also keep it pretty funny.""  Rippon said one of the biggest lessons he learned on his journey of personal growth regarded focusing on himself.  ""If you focus more on yourself and less on whatever other people think, you are able to have a better experience,"" he said. ""That a lot of what you do -- especially in a judged sport -- is out of your control. When you let go of that and you focus on what you can do to better yourself, you will end up having a better result. When you try things that you want to try you will ju"	1

"Mere hours before the media buying community floods into the Beacon Theatre for Fox's annual upfront presentation, Fox TV Group chairmen Dana Walden and Gary Newman addressed what's coming — and just as poignantly, what isn’t — from the network during a morning call with reporters.  Although the pair kicked off the half-hour with a nod to the network’s prior season standouts (Lethal Weapon, The Mick) and the forthcoming projects that seem to have them most excited (Marvel’s The Gifted, buddy paranormal comedy Ghosted), the project that got the most airtime was one that will not be airing on Fox next year. That series, of course, is American Idol, which will move from Fox to ABC for the 2017-18 season.  Rather than suggest that she was comfortable with the network switch, however, Walden was refreshingly candid about how challenging it is to see a show that was so meaningful to Fox for 15 years move to a rival. “It’s obviously a tough one for us,” she began. “It feels bad knowing it’s coming back on another network.”  Walden was similarly open about her frustration with Idol producers Fremantle, with whom Fox had been having conversations since the music competition wrapped in spring 2016. At issue: Fox had invested a tremendous amount of equity and resources promoting and celebrating the show’s final season. ""We spent $25 million sending the message that it was the farewell season and fans responded,"" she said. And though it did see a ratings uptick, Walden and her team felt it would be deceitful, even, as she put it, “extremely fraudulent,” to turn around and immediately go back into production with the show. Fremantle felt differently.  In Walden’s mind, waiting until 2020 would be a more respectful amount of time to have Idol sit on the bench. “We did not see the fan excitement and enthusiasm for the show to come back [sooner],” she added, suggesting Fremantle had a different set of facts. The latter, for whom Idol is a significant revenue generator, was driven from the day it wrapped to see it return as soon as possible.  But timing was not the only point of contention between Fox and the show’s producers. Among the others: the series’ price tag, which had ballooned in later seasons thanks to judge and host salaries in the eight-figure range. Those coupled with declining ratings — the show was down nearly 70 percent in its last half-decade on the air — prompted Fox to ask Fremantle to make cuts before the series had wrapped on Fox.  “The network was losing an enormous amount of money and we asked them to make trims,” explained Walden, adding that Fremantle had little interest in such trims, which would entail tweaking the show or the panel of star wattage that took years to get just right. “Fremantle doesn’t want to change that show and perhaps they shouldn’t,” she added, lingering frustration apparent in her voice. Despite it all, Fox continued to make offers for the show, if for no other reason than Walden and her team didn’t want to see a show so closely connected with their brand land elsewhere.  Earlier on in what she called a “challenging process,” Walden believed it was NBC that Fox would be competing against, and she acknowledged that at least that made sense to her. NBC has both Simon Cowell, whom she believed the franchise missed in its later iterations, and Jennifer Lopez based at its network, which would be helpful in a reboot. Alas, conversations with NBC broke down and Fremantle had little interest in Fox’s offer, so the show that famously catapulted Walden's network to No. 1 will now air on ABC."	1
Angelina Jolie has not been enjoying very pleasant headlines lately — not since her divorce and custody battle with Brad Pitt took a dark turn earlier this month.  In the headlines, Jolie has stopped being the serene mother of six, glamorous movie star or compassionate United Nations High Commissioners for Refugees special envoy.  More and more, the 43-year-old Jolie has been accused of being the “crazy and manipulative” estranged wife who has become increasingly “unpopular in Hollywood.” She’s “out for blood” in the divorce fight, or she “wants to embarrass and punish” the seemingly affable Pitt by portraying him in court papers as a deadbeat dad, or by apparently trying to undercut his relationship with their children, as suggested by a family law judge.  Also damning: Page Six reported last week that Jolie had developed “an insane jealousy” jealous of Amal Clooney, the international human rights attorney and wife of George Clooney. Jolie believes “Amal has stolen her identity” as the world’s most glamorous, admired humanitarian, a source told Page Six.  But breaking through all these negative headlines Tuesday was a reminder from Jolie herself of her world-class humanitarian credentials. She published an opinion piece on behalf of the UN agency’s efforts to boost educational opportunities for refugee children.  The timing of the piece, published on CNN.com, could be coincidental, given headlines this week about how Jolie had hired a new, more aggressive legal team to help finalize her divorce.  But as Jolie noted, she wrote her piece to advance important news: The UNHRC is about to publish a report in which the UN agency warns about the rising numbers of refugee children who are not receiving an education.  In any case, Jolie brought her cinematic story-telling experience to share moving accounts of what education means to children — girls especially — whose lives and communities have been upended by the ongoing Syrian civil war.  Jolie said she had met these girls herself during her goodwill trips to refugee camps in the war-torn region. She described one girl who had given up her dream of going to school and becoming a doctor after her mother was killed in an airstrike and she was forced to take care of her five younger siblings, Jolie said. With no other choice, the girl married at 14, can’t read or write and has been “robbed of her childhood and the future she might have had.”  The other girl was able to go to a local high school while living in a barren Iraqi refugee camp, and is now studying dentistry at a local Iraqi university — while still living with her parents in the camp, Jolie said.  “There are millions of young refugees with the energy and desire and commitment to study and work, who want to contribute to the societies that host them and ultimately help rebuild their home countries,” Jolie wrote. “There are millions of displaced parents who will make every sacrifice imaginable to help their children go to school.”  Jolie then argues how wealthier countries can help less fortunate countries rebuild after war: “Not with peace agreements and resolutions, as necessary as those are, but with millions of school report cards, exams passed, qualifications obtained, jobs acquired, and young lives turned to good purpose rather than spent languishing in camps.”  Jolie said she understands how overwhelming these refugee crises can seem to the outside world.  “Hardly a day goes past without bleak news headlines about violence, suffering and the displacement of people, from Afghanistan to Yemen,” Jolie wrote. “It is difficult to find a single example of where we are succeeding as an international community in ending conflicts and securing peace.”  But Jolie said there is an answer in helping refugees in a “patient, long-term manner, guided by our values.” She concluded her piece by writing: “If we help refugees get an education, they themselves will take on the harder task of rebuilding the countries whose future peace and	0
"Lili shared a hilarious (and #tooreal) photo on her Instagram stories, showing her smiling and makeup-free with little blobs of white cream dotted on her face. The caption: “Tinder profile: Hi I'm Lili. I'm 21, a Virgo, Cali-Girl 😝 And I have cystic acne. Hmu.”  RELATED: Ruby Rose Opens Up About Battling Adult Acne In Emotional Instagram Post  Lili Reinhart  Her condition, cystic acne, is the most severe form of acne, according to the Mayo Clinic. It happens when oil and dead skin cells build up deep within hair follicles, causing large, festering bumps under the skin that can't be popped. They're generally caused by hormones and P.acnes, the bacteria that can cause acne. (And it can be painful AF). It sucks, but thankfully, Lili's got a sense of humour about it.  This isn't the first time Lili has opened up about her cystic acne. Last fall, the 21-year-old shared her skin-care routine on her Instagram stories, including her favourite go-to face mask (which is only $9 on Amazon!) and exfoliating peel.  And she's not the only Hollywood star who has this struggle. Kendall Jenner told a fan to ""never let that sh*t stop you!"" after appearing on the Golden Globes red carpet with acne in January. And in a recent Instagram Story, Justin Bieber declared that ""pimples are in"" with a photo of himself with a sprinkle of zits across his forehead.  RELATED: Kendall Jenner Had The Perfect Response When Her Acne Was Attacked At The Golden Globes  It's refreshing to see a celeb share their not-so-perfect skin on social media (proof that in some ways, they're still just like us).

"EXCLUSIVE  Bella Hadid just got a restraining order against a man who had allegedly been threatening her online and apparently lurking around her apartment.  Brian Perez has been ordered to stay clear of Bella. He had posted a pic of Bella's apartment recently, and she fears he might be staking out her New York City apartment.  Cops say Perez had been on a harassment campaign against Bella. According to legal docs, Hadid had received multiple Instagram messages from an account registered to Perez.

Jennifer Lopez and Mariah Carey (Photos: Getty Images)  Rumors of a feud between Jennifer Lopez and Mariah Carey have existed in Internet lore for years. And, like most pop star-on-pop star feuds which appear to exist solely in the minds of fans, it’s the type of thing that the two are constantly having to deny. Twice this week Jennifer Lopez has had to address it and, twice this week, Lopez has denied it.  So here’s how the whole thing went down.  The Beginnings  In the early ‘00s, Mariah Carey was doing an interview with a foreign TV station in which she was asked her opinion about several pop stars. She called Beyoncé “nice” and “a good writer” and then she was asked about Jennifer Lopez. “I don’t know her,” Mariah Carey said. And, immediately, a meme was born.  If you’ve not seen the GIF, you’ve probably not spent a lot of time on the web.  The Aftermath  It is years later; “I don’t know her” has become perhaps the most iconic words to come out of Mariah Carey’s mouth since “all I want for Christmas is you.” It was Andy Cohen, in 2014, who was the first to ask J.Lo directly about the shade of it all.    “I know from back in the day, I’ve read things that she’s said about me that were not the greatest, but we have never met,” Lopez, who is no amateur at delivering a verbal knockout, said. “Like, we don’t know each other. I think it’s kind of from word of mouth of things that have happened in the past that I’m not really aware of.”    Then, last year, Carey was doing an interview with The Cut in which she was asked about gifts she receives from her army of fans, the “Lambs.”  Recently? I don’t know. [yawns] I’m sorry, I’m having a “sleep” moment…    Well, there was a very interesting shirt that a fan made with a quote that I said years ago that, when I said it, I really wasn’t trying to be funny. I was just being honest and everybody’s kind of blowing it out of proportion but this guy had a shirt on and it was a picture of me that he made and the quote was underneath it — and I’m going to leave you hanging as to what it was.  To recap: Carey yawns before she explains she was “just being honest.” The word shade is thrown around hyperbolically these days, but true shade doesn’t really sound like an insult. However, the recipient knows. Mariah Carey is one of the masters of the art.  Round Two  Talk of the feud picked up after last year’s Billboard Music Awards, at which Lopez was caught checking Instagram during Carey’s performance. Video of Lopez idly scrolling through her feed immediately became Lopez’s visual response to Carey’s “I don’t know her” GIF.  Which Brings Us to This Week…  Jennifer Lopez is currently on a media blitz promoting the staggering number of projects — Shades of Blue, American Idol, The Fosters, etc. — she’s currently working on. Her first stop was Watch What Happens Live where, again, Andy Cohen asked about Mariah Carey.  “First of all, that was not fair with the texting thing because I watched a lot of it — it was a long performance,“ Lopez said, in what is not not shade. “I watched most of it, I may have looked down for one second and people were like, ‘Look at her! Look at her!’”  Lopez then booked it over to The Wendy Williams Show where she was talking about her Vegas residency, saying she saw all the shows currently on before she signed her deal, except for Mariah Carey because Carey’s show didn’t start until Lopez was already back in New York to film Shades of Blue. Williams saw her chance and took it with the gusto of a bird of prey.  “Who?” the talk show host joked of Carey. “No, I’m playing because that’s what Mariah said about Jennifer one time.”    “She does say that,” Lopez responded, before delivering her magnum opus. “She’s forgetful I guess.”  	0

She was teen America's bubble gum pop princess, but not everything stayed candy sweet for this star.  Mandy Moore has opened up about her tough few years which has seen her struggle personally and professionally.  The 32-year-old spoke candidly in a new interview with Rhapsody Magazine for United Airlines, revealing she is finding her footing after a painful period in her life.  Revival: Mandy Moore has opened up about her tough few years which has seen her struggle personally and professionally  The Walk To Remember Star only just finalised her divorce to husband of six years Ryan Adams but said the split had to happen.  The star told the September issue of the magazine: 'It's not easy having to split up your life, and it still makes me really, really sad.  'For better or worse, I poured all of myself into my relationship. So it's nice that that chapter of my life has closed.'  Not holding back: The 32-year-old spoke candidly in a new interview with Rhapsody Magazine for United Airlines , revealing she is finding her footing after a painful period in her life  The pair called it quits back in 2015 but a drawn out divorce battle for spousal support and custody of their animals ensured the former teen star and her alt musician ex were not officially split until June this year.  Mandy has since moved on with another musician Taylor Goldsmith, with whom she just celebrated a year with.  Their union has once again ignited Mandy's passion for music - something which she had lost for some time.  'I miss music. For the last year or so, hanging out in this world again has ignited that part of my brain. Things finally feel like they're falling into place.  'I'm not going to let anybody or anything hold me back anymore.'  And it seems like she may have a Taylor Swift-esque musical plan in mind, so Ryan should probably prepare himself.  'I have soooo much to say and so much to write about,' the star told the magazine of her musical aspirations.  Mandy, of course, first burst into the world as a pop star in the late Nineties with song, Candy.  Had to happen: The 32-year-old split with husband six years Ryan Adams but said she gave too much of herself to the relationship, so while sad, 'it's nice that chapter of my life has closed'  Long time coming: The pair (pictured 2012) called it quits back in 2015 but a drawn out divorce battle for spousal support and custody of their animals ensured the former teen star and her alt musician ex were not officially split until June this year  The then-teen was presented to the world as the next Britney Spears or Christina Aguilera but, despite her once massive hit, her musical career did not quite take off as much as her contemporaries.  The star said it may have been because she was far less provocative: 'Maybe that was a conscious choice from the powers that be - that I was going to be different than that. I'll never know. But I am kind of prudish and quiet, and I was never going to show my midriff.'  New man: Mandy has since moved on with another musician Taylor Goldsmith, with whom she just celebrated a year with  Mandy then went for teen singer to movie star but as the 2000s wore on, the offers of movie roles just started to dry up.  Rejection, she told the magazine, started to become something she face regularly -she has been attached to three television shows that never made it to air in as many years.  But it was something she never got used to: 'It was soul-crushing. I don't know how actors do this year in and year out. I feel like I have been treading water for a while.'  Her 'treading water' seems to have finally paid off, however, with the 32-year-old cast in new NBC series This Is Us.  Mandy will be playing a new mother and described the role as 'transformative'.  The series was exactly what she needed, the star said: 'As soon as I read the script I was like, ''I have to be a part of this. This is something I would watch.''

EXCLUSIVE: TGIT fans can rejoice – Scandal creator Shonda Rhimes and How to Get Away with Murder creator Peter Nowalk just confirmed our scoop that the two Shondaland drama series will be staging a crossover event this season. Rhimes and Nowalk posted the same screen shot of a page from a crossover script featuring both Kerry Washington’s Scandal character, Washington fixer Olivia Pope, and Viola Davis’ How To Get Away with Murder character, law professor Annalise Keating. It appears to reveal the women’s first meeting. “People. It’s happening,” Rhimes captioned her post (you can see it below), with both using hashtags, #TGITCrossover and #HowtoGetAwaywithScandal.  In an exclusive interview with Deadline, Nowalk shares as many details as he could without spoiling the stunt for the fans, including who will be part of the crossover and will Washington and Davis share scenes, something the script excerpt confirms. He also provides clues about the storyline’s setting and the event’s timing.  Related Story Matt McGorry Reveals Future Of His 'How To Get Away With Murder' Character After Fall Finale  DEADLINE: How did the idea about a Scandal-How To Get Away With Murder crossover come about?  NOWALK: At the beginning of the season, my writers and I were planning out Viola’s entire arc and something in her story organically came up that was very appropriate for Scandal. When I went to Shonda, she heard it. I said, we don’t have to do it, Viola’s arc doesn’t need this, but it’s possible that their stories could cross really organically. She actually pulled up a clip of something from Scandal and their side of the story coalesced perfectly. So it was one of those serendipitous things where we both realized it was good for both characters, and it almost felt like we had been planning it since last season.  At that point, we just thought about it because we didn’t want it to feel forced, and we just wanted it to happen really naturally. And then if anything bumps along the way, we just won’t do it. We kept getting closer and closer, and it just made more and more sense. I will say, the Scandal read-through, I, as an audience member, just found it so refreshing and fun, and it really felt like Annalise fit in that episode really well. So now the pressure for us for Murder is just to match that level of excitement that they created.  DEADLINE: I assume that the episodes will be tied together in a two-hour block on the same night, with the story starting on Scandal and finishing on How To Get Away With Murder?  NOWALK: Yes.  DEADLINE: Will we see both Olivia on How To Get Away With Murder and Annalise on Scandal as well as on their own shows?  ABC  NOWALK: I’ll say the whole two hours takes place in the same setting, and they have that arc over those two hours together.  DEADLINE: One show is set in Philadelphia, the other one in Washington, DC. If the setting is the same throughout the crossover, is that setting Washington, DC, Philadelphia, or a third location?  NOWALK: All I’ll say is that the setting for each of them is consistent. The storyline for Olivia and Annalise takes place in one location.  DEADLINE: Are the events in the two episodes continuous? Is there a gap between what happens on Scandal and Murder?  NOWALK: There’s not much of a gap, and in case someone watches one show on Netflix and not the other, the episodes make sense for each character on their own.  DEADLINE: Will there be scenes with Kerry’s Olivia and Viola’s Annalise together?  NOWALK: Yes, Annalise and Olivia will be in scenes together.  DEADLINE: Will each of them also interact with other characters on the other show?  NOWALK: There will be some of that.  DEADLINE: Is it fair to say that Annalise and Olivia will team up to do something together?  NOWALK: I don’t think we want to give that away yet. If I were a viewer, the thing I would want to see is Kerry and Viola in a scene together, that was really the reason to do it. To have storyline together and really s	1
Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin are waiting until next year to tie the knot, despite getting engaged last month.  According to TMZ, the pair have decided to postpone their wedding until 2019, as they don't want to 'put pressure' on themselves and rush the big day.  Justin, 24, and his model girlfriend, 21, are still excited about becoming man and wife, but feel making the 'commitment' to each other is what really matters.  Holding off: Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin are waiting until next year to tie the knot, despite getting engaged last month (pictured in July)  A source told the site: 'Justin and Hailey are waiting until sometime next year to tie the knot as they feel they've made the commitment, and that's the most important thing.'  While the couple have faced criticism for getting engaged so quickly, the source revealed the pop star is sure Hailey is the one, having been besotted with her for many years.  The insider continued: 'Justin's been in love with her for a long time, so this didn't just come from out of the blue.'  Taking it slow: According to new reportes, the pair have decided to postpone their wedding until 2019, as they don't want to 'put pressure' on themselves and rush the big day  MailOnline has contacted both Justin and Hailey's representatives for further comment.  Justin proposed to Hailey, who is the daughter of actor and producer Stephen Baldwin, during a trip to the Bahamas last month.  After two days of swirling rumours, the Sorry hitmaker went on to confirm the news to fans on Instagram, with a sweet tribute to his blonde beauty.  He wrote: 'Was gonna wait a while to say anything but word travels fast, listen plain and simple Hailey I am soooo in love with everything about you!  'So committed to spending my life getting to know every single part of you loving you patiently and kindLY. I promise to lead our family with honor and integrity letting Jesus through his Holy Spirit guide us in everything we do and every decision we make.  'My heart is COMPLETELY and FULLY YOURS and I will ALWAYS put you first! You are the love of my life Hailey Baldwin and I wouldn't want to spend it with anybody else.'  Justin and Hailey have known each other since 2009 as members of the Hillsong Church, which they regularly attend together in LA.  However, eyebrows were raised over the pair's engagement, considering the pop star only split from Selena Gomez in March.  Justin dated the pop diva, 26, on and off for seven years, enduring numerous break-ups and reconciliations, with the most recent taking place in November 2017.  Want more content like this?

Fans of Netflix’s cult favorite sci-fi drama series Sense8 have long been excited that the show will do something never done before by an original Netflix series: Return from cancellation. And as of Friday, June 8, the two-hour finale is available to stream on Netflix. The special was directed by Sense8 creator Lana Wachowski and promises to give fans a proper conclusion to the series.  The series about eight people connected through cosmic ways was canceled by Netflix weeks after its second season premiered. Wachowski credited “the passionate letters, the petitions, the collective voice that rose up” from the legion of die-hard Sense8 fans with the show’s revival, according to the heartfelt letter she shared on the show’s official Facebook page.”Improbably, unforeseeably, your love has brought Sense8 back to life.” This is quite surprising since the show’s official Facebook page informed fans days after the show’s cancellation that their petitions and messages were heard but not enough to bring the show back to Netflix.  The letter not only revived hope of Sense8‘s return to our lives but also gave the most definitive answer as to why it was canceled in the first place. In the letter, Wachowski stated Netflix did “love the show as much as we do, but the numbers have always been challenging.” She did not clarify if the numbers she was referring to were low viewership data, the expensive production cost, or both. Either way, that point is now moot in the face of the show’s return and opportunity for closure.  Despite the finality of its brief return, there’s still a sliver of hope that Sense 8 could continue on even further. At the time of its revival from cancellation, Wachowski would not rule out even more Sense8 in the future, writing, “After that … if this experience has taught me anything, you NEVER know.”  The new two-hour special is the second of its kind in the series. Two days before Christmas in 2016, Netflix released a two-hour holiday special called Happy F*cking New Year.  Sense8 was part of Netflix’s cancellation spree that saw fan-favorites The Get Down, Marco Polo, and the star-studded drama Bloodline canceled within eight months of each other. Unfortunately for fans of those other series, they have not enjoyed the swift resurrection that Sense 8 received.  Update on June 8: The series finale is available on Netflix.

Although she is a household name now and the perpetual focus of celebrity coverage, there was a time when Angelina Jolie's star was much dimmer. The Oscar-winning actress really became a big name thanks to her starring role in the video game adaptation, Lara Croft: Tomb Raider. The actress starred as Lara Croft in two films that still stand as some of the few decent video game movies. Many people still identify Angelina Jolie with the role, so you might think that she would want to check out the reboot starring Alicia Vikander, which debuted in theaters last weekend. Well, despite earlier reports to the contrary, it seems that Angelina Jolie did not take her kids to see Tomb Raider, as they saw Love, Simon instead.	0
"My name is Nwando Kate (Kartia) Onyeka. I am a wife, mother, nurse and skin care consultant. As      far back as I can remember, I had always had a love and flare for fashion and style. Back in the day      growing up as a teenager in school, I remember wearing my school uniforms always a little different      from the other girls! I usually hemmed my skirts a little shorter and added some beads for good      measure…hahaha. Of course my friends, you can imagine that there was always some price to pay      on my part as the teachers were not particularly enamoured by my creativity!      Anyway…….., I had always wanted to be a model back then but because I never had the support or      professional guidance that was required to transform this dream into reality, I was never able to do      much about it and it remained just a dream for quite a long time, tucked away someplace in my      heart, waiting to blossom. Looking forwards however (notice how I didn’t say looking backwards?), I      honestly believe that this is the perfect time for me to showcase my love and flare for fashion and      style with the perfect backdrop of the maturity and self-confidence that I now possess. My three boys      are all grown: 21, 16, and 14; and I am at that point in my life where I am actually able to follow my      dream.      My parents have ten children of which I am the sixth child. My siblings call me ""ndomma"" meaning      “beautiful”, some of my friends call me ""catalog"", my husband calls me ""my fashionista wife"" and I      call myself “Kartia Velino”. I am very optimistic about what life has to offer, I go for the best in life and      I believe in aspiring to inspire other women with the same zeal that I have.      I invite you to step into my world and enjoy MY LOVE AND FLARE FOR FASHION AND STYLE! It    "	1
"Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt are currently enjoying their private lives post their separation from their respective partners. However, their personal and professional lives constantly create sensational headlines. Most recently, it was absurdly claimed that Jennifer and her ex-husband Brad could have a sensational reunion on the sets of a new rom-com movie.  The latest report from Heat Magazine asserted that the newly single Jennifer and Brad are said to be ""seriously considering"" featuring in a feature film together for the first time. Prior to this, they shared screen space in FRIENDS TV series when Brad made a memorable cameo.  An alleged source told the magazine that since Brad and Jennifer both are friends again, it would be a tremendous opportunity to make a feature-length film. However, the new characters will not be seen as ardent lovers, but they would typically have to interact in front of the camera.  ""It's not like they would be playing lovers or anything, but the project is in the romantic comedy genre and their characters would cross paths. The movie producers are really excited and feel this would be dynamite casting,"" added the insider.  Jennifer and Brad married in 2000 but split after five years. The latter decided to start a new life with Angelina Jolie, whereas Jennifer decided to focus on different movie projects. Back in 2011, Jennifer started seeing Justin Theroux and got married in August 2015. But the couple announced they were ""lovingly"" parting their ways after just two years of marriage.  Ever since Aniston and Theroux ended their marriage, many speculated that Brad Pitt and Jennifer will soon reconcile their previous differences. However, this is not the case. Gossip Cop repeatedly confirmed that Brad and Jennifer have not in touch with each other ever since their divorce.  Gossip Cop also debunked the claims made by the Heat Magazine that Jen and Brad are reuniting for a romantic comedy-drama. Apparently, this is not the first time when the reports surfaced that pointed towards a possible feature film starring Aniston and Pitt. Back in March 2017, there were multiple reports that We Are The Millers star was considering to work with the Once Upon a Time in Hollywood actor.  ""There are no projects that Jennifer is considering with Brad,"" Jennifer's spokesperson revealed."	0
"Just a few weeks ago, Bachelor in Paradise wasn't a sure thing that was happening this summer, but now it's officially coming back on August 14. But the first footage of the show fans got to see wasn't exactly what most people expected. On Monday night, the Bachelor in Paradise Season 4 trailer dropped and a lot of fans felt that it seemed kind of inappropriate after everything that's happened surrounding the show. (ABC declined to comment on the promo.)  Instead of showing a few scenes that would give fans something to look forward to in the month left before the premiere like most first promos do, this one had a bit of a different tone. It first played up how upset some fans were when they found out that Bachelor in Paradise production was put on hold last month following a producer complaint about the relationship between Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson. Then the preview showed how some fans celebrated when news broke that the show actually was coming back, after all.  At the time of the production shut down, Warner Brothers, the production company for the show, stated: ""We have become aware of allegations of misconduct on the set of Bachelor in Paradise in Mexico. We have suspended production and we are conducting a thorough investigation of these allegations. Once the investigation is complete, we will take appropriate responsive action."" The investigation was later concluded with no evidence of wrongdoing. A Warner Bros. spokesperson gave this statement to Bustle about production resuming.  Our internal investigation, conducted with the assistance of an outside law firm, has now been completed. Out of respect for the privacy interests of those involved, we do not intend to release the videotape of the incident. We can say, however, that the tape does not support any charge of misconduct by a cast member. Nor does the tape show, contrary to many press reports, that the safety of any cast member was ever in jeopardy. Production on this season of Bachelor in Paradise will be resuming, and we plan to implement certain changes to the show’s policies and procedures to enhance and further ensure the safety and security of all participants.”  But even though many fans were happy when they found out that BiP was coming back after all, it seemed wrong to many fans to promote the season this way — after all, what happened involved real people and affected their real lives.  Even though the investigation launched by Warner Brothers came up with no evidence of wrongdoing, Corinne and DeMario have both been open about how the situation affected their lives outside of BiP in interviews they've done since. And beyond Corinne and DeMario, there was an entire cast of people (plus the show's crew) who were affected by the show's brief suspension of production. Making light of the situation wasn't really the best way the show could have chosen to handle or move past what happened. In fact, the trailer didn't even need to address it — that could have been saved for the premiere — but the way that it did was uncomfortable for many to watch.  The trailer talked more about the fact that the show was cancelled and then revived than what's going to happen in the season to come. There were a few quick clips and soundbites from contestants, but it paled in comparison to the amount of time spent on showing tweets from fans on the screen.  There are many fans who are excited to watch BiP in August. But celebrating it so blatantly when real people's lives were involved? That didn't really seem to sit well with many viewers."	1
Teen Vogue: grown-ish has definitely taken off and it was renewed for a second season, which is so exciting. How are you feeling about the show’s popularity? Was this something you expected?  Michelle Cole: I’m extremely proud of it. For me personally when I’m doing a show at all — and I’ve been doing this for about thirty-five years — I don’t do a show thinking about what will happen next. I’m always thinking, “How can I do my job?” And I think that has worked well for me, as I’m always giving it one hundred and twenty percent. Fortunately, most of the pilots I’ve worked on have been picked up, but I do it because I enjoy it and I have a love for it. Even if this hadn’t been picked up, I know it would have still looked great. When we were doing the pilot, we were under a little bit of pressure because we were shooting it in four days and we had a lot of setup. And we didn’t quite know the show because we were trying to figure out characters. Every week, you’re trying to develop your characters because every week you get that script that reveals them a little bit more. It’s like dating. The exciting part is that I’m unfolding these different layers of different characters. With Zoey, coming from her parents' home and going to college, we’re seeing her blossom in front of us. When she was on black-ish, she had her other siblings that she was with, but we’re getting to see her blossom on her own in this show. I’m extremely proud of our hard work. Hair and makeup make me look great and I give them a huge shout out because they make the outfits look as I’d like to call it “mo’ better”. And Yara has a lot of input. I didn’t know what to expect, but I know what I expected from me and my team.  TV: It’s one of my favorite new shows, so I’d say all your hard work has absolutely paid off.  MC: And that’s the good part! It pretty much always pays off because whether it’s good or bad, it’s a learning process. Did we know it was going to be so big? Well, I think the best surprise is how successful it is.  TV: And what you said before about black-ish, how Zoey has grown up and that transition going off on her own at school, I’m wondering how you approached that. She’s definitely taking more style risks and it’s noticeable, but it still feels like her. How are you approaching the different phases of her life?  MC: We did a lot of boards on each character and Yara does have a lot of input on how she feels. I’ve also known her since the pilot, when she was fourteen years old. I’ve seen in her own life and how she approaches style personally. When we see her take off to college in the first episode, she tells her father to get a life and that she’s on her own. She hangs up on him and I think we see her start to take these risks. She’s always had beautiful clothes and it’s always been great fun to dress Zoey because she was already very stylish on black-ish. But here she’s grown-up. She’ll wear a robe with a Sade t-shirt underneath and then a scarf and big hoop earrings. We did take a bit more risks with a Gucci loafer and Zara PJ outfit, which was one of my favorites. I love that when she gets up in the morning that she doesn’t really think about it: she just puts it on. She wears what she feels like wearing that day. She’ll go from a sweater with a cotton blouse underneath to a fake fur, jeans, and some boots the next time we see her. We feature a lot of wonderful, big brand names, but it’s more about her look and her style. We like mixing it up. Her risk is showing that she’s growing up. When you see her in the first scenes of the show, she’s trying on different tops when she’s going to her night class. She ends up going with a sweatshirt.  We also start to see her in really cute dresses coming up. We’ve started to show her legs and her shape in some of these outfits, which we didn’t do on black-ish. She’s in college, so that’s a transition. Her mother is played by Tracee Ellis Ross, so come on. She dresses amazing on black-ish and is wearin	1

"Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth want you to know that everything is fine. Shortly after rumors spread this morning claiming that the couple split and called off their wedding, the Hunger Games actor posted a video with Cyrus on his Instagram story, proving they're still going strong.  The couple doesn't explicitly address the split gossip in the clip. Instead, they show themselves dancing and getting silly in the car. Miley films a selfie video of them grooving to the music until Liam screams and scares her.  ""I'm gonna beat the sh—,"" she jokingly threatens in response to his prank. He just smiles and says, ""Number one!"" to the camera.      The clip is a candid, intimate, and sweet portrait of their relationship that says, ""See? Everything's normal!""    Fans have seen Hemsworth pull that stunt on Cyrus before. This spring, Miley posted a selfie video from the front seat where she and Liam are dancing in the front seat during a drive—but then he shouts, ""Oh sh*t!"" and causes her to drop her phone.  And back in 2016, the duo was singing along to Justin Bieber's ""Love Yourself"" during a ride with their beagle, but Liam interrupted that sweet moment with another shouting prank too. Miley reprimands him, ""Babe, stop, seriously!""  Before today's Instagram video, there was already one solid piece of evidence that Cyrus and Hemsworth were still together, despite the breakup rumors: one fan spotted the couple landing in the Nashville airport yesterday.  VIDEO | Miley & Liam were spotted at the airport in Nashville.    July 18th, 2018. pic.twitter.com/w3cAAfAtey — ً (@MIAMPICTURES) July 19, 2018  We've had enough celebrity breakups in 2018; thankfully we don't have to add this one to the list."	1
"Chris Martin of Coldplay performs during the A Head Full of Dreams Tour at MetLife Stadium on July 17, 2016 in East Rutherford, N.J.  Just days after canceling a gig in Houston due to Hurricane Harvey, Coldplay paid tribute to their Texas fans during Monday night's (Aug. 28) show in Miami with a new song dedicated to their love of all things Lone Star, ""Houston."" Singer Chris Martin explained to the crowd at Hard Rock Stadium in Miami that the group wrote the new song, ""because we all grew up loving country music, and of course that's kind of what we think of when we go to Texas. So if you'll bear with us, this is a new song and we'll never play this again.""  Martin explained that the band would play the acoustic song one time for fans in Miami and that they wanted to ""send it over there to everyone who missed the show,"" with lyrics that pray for Texans to make it through the rain so the band can come back down to see them again soon. As spotted by HuffPo, the song features the lyrics, ""I'm dreamin' of when I get back to Houston/ I'm dreamin' of that fair and special place/ I'm dreamin' of when Houston has no problems/ In that city where they send you into space/ I'm dreamin' of when I get back to Texas/ Corpus Christie, Harris County, Galveston... Houston you got to keep on keepin' on.""  Listen to it below and look for a list of ways you can help the victims of Hurricane Harvey.

"Congrats are in order for Mama June!  The reality star's eldest daughter, 18-year-old Lauryn ""Pumpkin"" Shannon, married Joshua Efird in Las Vegas on Monday, a source tells ET.  Ahead of Pumpkin’s nuptials, a source tells ET that the family was seen lounging at the Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino pool cabanas over the weekend. On Monday, Pumpkin and her husband said ""I do"" inside Planet Hollywood’s wedding chapel.  Following the ceremony, an eyewitness tells ET the newlyweds had dinner at Buca di Beppo, an Italian-American food chain, with Mama June and Pumpkin's younger sister, Alana ""Honey Boo Boo"" Thompson, by their side. The family enjoyed a variety of dishes in a private dining area and a wedding cake was wheeled into the room for the celebration, the eyewitness says. Our source tells us cameras were on site, and the ceremony will be featured on the new season of Mama June: From Not to Hot.  Pumpkin and Efird became engaged in June 2016, and welcomed their first child together, daughter Ella Grace, last December.

Brody Jenner is breaking his silence after Caitlyn Jenner skipped his wedding this past weekend.  “It was a big disappointment,” the 34-year-old son of the former Olympian told People. “Especially considering that she had known about the wedding for a year.”  “I wasn’t surprised,” he added. “I’m pretty used to her doing that sort of thing.”  Brody and his wife, Kaitlynn Carter, married at the Nihi Sumba Resort on Sumba island, off the coast of Indonesia on Saturday (June 2).  Find out where Caitlyn was instead of attending her son’s wedding. Kendall and Kylie Jenner, Brody‘s half-sisters, were also not in attendance at the affair and never RSVP’d.	0
Late-night comedy wasn’t always a place that digested the news the way CNN or MSNBC might, but Donald Trump has changed that. Gone are the days when late-night was a place for lite fare, its humor largely detached from the realities of current events. Even in the Nixon era, perhaps the closest analogue to the daily chaos and impropriety of Donald Trump’s presidency, late-night hosts were careful not to push their personal politics. “In the monologue, Johnny will attack malfeasance, illiberal behavior, constitutional abuses,” Kenneth Tynan once wrote of Mr Carson, who hosted The Tonight Show from 1962 to 1992. “But then compassion sets in. He was the first person to stop doing anti-Nixon jokes.”    Jimmy Fallon on his Trump interview: 'I didn't do it to humanize him' Read more  Now, another host in The Tonight Show lineage, Jimmy Fallon, is in a similar position, with the tables turned. As the host sticks to fluff and mostly apolitical humor, his ratings have nosedived in the face of his perceived neutrality. New Yorker critic Emily Nussbaum described Fallon as an enthusiast, “which sounds good, until you see him spray the same gush on everything”. At a time when his peers are earning points for smart rebukes of the Trump administration, Fallon’s self-effacing anecdotes and best-friend schtick often feel like an undercooked hors d’oeuvre preceding Seth Meyers’ acerbic political main course, which airs after him.  The ratings have proved that viewers are deserting The Tonight Show, too. Where Fallon once towered above his 11.35pm time-slot rivals, Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Kimmel, he’s now in danger of slipping into third place – something that was unthinkable even 12 months ago. Fallon averaged nearly 4 million viewers a night in 2015, and almost 3.5 million the year after. In 2017, he’s pulling in just over 2.5 million a show, a steep drop by Tonight Show standards.  It all started in September of last year, when Fallon’s schmaltzy interview with the then candidate Trump found the host in hot water. Thirteen months on, the encounter seems even stranger. The interview begins with softball questions: “There’s probably kids watching right now … why should they want to grow up and be president?” He follows those up by asking Trump if he had ever seen himself getting into politics; then he asks what’s changed over the course of the campaign. The most infamous portion of the interview, of course, is when Fallon asks Trump’s permission to mess up his hair. It was a lesson in how to fumble a golden opportunity and normalize a deeply unqualified, proto-fascist candidate.  “If Jimmy Fallon had any credibility left as a thinking comedian with a point of view, he lost the last shred of it last night,” Sonia Saraiya noted in Variety the morning after. Fallon’s genuflection toward Trump coincided with his ratings decline: the week of the Trump interview, he led Colbert and Kimmel both by over 1 million viewers. By the inauguration in January, he and Colbert were neck and neck. And last week, Colbert brought in 500,000 more nightly viewers than Fallon while Kimmel, after several blistering attacks on the Graham-Cassidy healthcare bill, was inching towards second place.  All of this suggests that viewers don’t seem to have an appetite for Fallon’s happy-medium approach. And while he’ll still nab the occasional viral video – his comments on the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, for example – the opening monologues of Colbert, Kimmel, Seth Meyers, Trevor Noah and Samantha Bee have consistently out-thought Fallon.  Facebook Twitter Pinterest Killing them softly: Miley Cyrus and Jimmy Fallon take part in one of the host’s trademark song and dance routines.

"Eric Deggans:  Well, I do think what's interesting to me about this show is that it didn't really explore the roots of why somebody like Roseanne Conner, who, when we last saw her, you know, was supporting abortion rights, supported gay rights, trying to investigate on her own whether she and her husband had unwittingly transmitted racist views to their son, when he didn't want to kiss a black girl in a school pageant, how somebody like that came to believe that voting for Donald Trump was something that made sense, when Hillary Clinton seemed to be much more in line with those values.  And I don't think the show really investigated that. And that felt like a lost opportunity. When the show was at its height, they spent two episodes looking at how all the characters on that show felt about abortion.  The episodes that I talked about with D.J., Roseanne's son, and racism, they spent a whole episode exploring how he might have come to feel that way and how Roseanne and Dan may have unwittingly contributed to that.  The discuss that we saw in this new ""Roseanne"" was basically a series of sort of jabs and insults traded between two characters. They didn't take a lot of time to sort of investigate how Roseanne may have come to feel the way she felt or how other people in her family may have felt about it. A lot of it was implied.  And I noticed when I tried to talk to the cast about this, when I tried to talk to Roseanne about this back in January, that they were a little hesitant to talk about the political implications of what they were doing and why they were making the choices that they were making to make Roseanne a Trump supporter in the first place."	1
Why Is It Airing Now?  According to the executive producer, Terry Wrong, Fox dug up this interview to satisfy the huge demand for more O.J.-related television. The former network executive Preston Beckman — known on Twitter as “the Masked Scheduler” — noted in a blog post that Fox probably intentionally showed it on Sunday night to counterprogram ABC’s premiere of the revived “American Idol.” (“They probably don’t want egg on their face if ‘AI’ returns with an impressive number,” he said.)  In interviews leading up to the broadcast, both Ms. O’Brien and Mr. Wrong stressed that Mr. Simpson didn’t get a dime for this special. He was reportedly paid $800,000 for the book “If I Did It” in 2006, but got no money for the interview then, according to Fox. Fox, on the other hand, definitely stands to benefit — which was one of the complaints levied before the broadcast was scrapped the first time.  Fox, Ms. Regan, Ms. O’Brien and Mr. Darden have all insisted that “The Lost Confession” is a vital document in the era of #MeToo and #TimesUp. The special was framed as a look inside the mind of a domestic abuser, and perhaps a warning to any woman who might be in a relationship with someone who talks the way Mr. Simpson does in the interview. Mr. Wrong also made sure to point out that unlike in 2006, the Brown and Goldman families gave their blessing to show this footage, ostensibly because they believe it makes Mr. Simpson look guilty.  Does O.J. Come Clean?  It certainly seemed that way. Bear in mind that this interview has been edited down from about four hours (according to Ms. Regan, in promos Fox sent to TV critics), and that throughout Mr. Simpson is referring to the “hypothetical” confession in the book “If I Did It.” In the six minutes in which he talks about the murders, he describes being on the scene with a friend named Charlie — whom the panel believes was just a voice inside his head. It’s all very odd.  That said, when Mr. Simpson describes grabbing a knife (“I do remember that part,” he says), and recalls seeing copious amounts of blood, it doesn’t sound all that hypothetical. The interview goes on to cover the aftermath of the crime — including the infamous Bronco chase — and Ms. Regan’s questioning about what was going through Mr. Simpson’s mind at that time keeps steering him toward explaining his feelings of anger, frustration, depression and yes, guilt.  [ALSO READ: The O.J. Simpson Murder Trial, as Covered by the Times]  “The Lost Confession” also offers a glimpse into its subject’s character. It’s fascinating to see Mr. Simpson blasting the media, all while frequently reminding Ms. Regan of his past reputation as a successful and popular guy. He seems to cling to every half-truth about his relationship with Ms. Brown that makes him look like he’s the real victim.	1

Oh no — a new report claims Khloe Kardashian had major pregnancy issues that prematurely landed her in the hospital! Find out here what reportedly went wrong.  At nearly nine months pregnant, Khloe Kardashian, 33, recently experienced a health scare that “left her rattled,” according to OK! magazine. While everything is ok now, and Khloe is no longer at Cedars-Sinai in LA, she’s reportedly SO shaken up that she’s reconsidering giving birth in Cleveland! “Word is, she suffered some pregnancy complications and had to be rushed to Cedars-Sinai in Los Angles,” an insider told the publication. “Everyone was worried she’d need an emergency C-section.” Click here to see pics of Khloe’s lavish baby shower.  The source didn’t expand on what type of complications Khloe was having, but, apparently Khloe thinks it COULD have to do with her recent trip to Japan with her sisters. Although she was already eight months along, the reality star decided to fly overseas, insisting her doctor approved the entire thing. “I wouldn’t put my baby at risk,” she said at the time. Now, however, she may have had a change of heart. “Khloe took all the necessary precautions with her trip, but now of course she’s wondering if it contributed to an unnecessary scare,” the insider shared.  Luckily, Khole’s family was by her side during her health incident, but if she follows through with her plan to give birth in Cleveland, so baby daddy Tristan Thompson, 27, can be there, she won’t have that same level of familial support. “She’s anxious about flying again and being so far from her family. This experience made her realize she needs her support system nearby,” the source explained, adding that her current Cleveland birthing plan is “up in the air.”  But while her family was there to help her through this alleged recent scare, Tristan, was working back in Ohio. “He was on the road with his team and she was so emotional about him not being there,” the source said. “It got really heated…Things have calmed down since the spat, but they’re both so busy with work. It’s been stressful.”  This past weekend, on March 10, Tristan WAS there to celebrate his and Khloe’s impending arrival. The two had a gorgeous baby shower for their baby girl, and of course everything was covered in pink. While this has been a magical time for KoKo, she’s also beyond ready to meet her daughter! “She can’t wait to just hold her baby girl in her arms and know that she’s safe,” OK’s insider said.	0

(Photo by Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP, File)  CINCINNATI (AP) — Veteran TV journalist Katie Couric recounted Thursday facing demeaning descriptions and “gross comments” during her career.  Couric spoke at consumer products maker Procter & Gamble’s Cincinnati headquarters in a forum on the state of women in the workplace. The #WeSeeEqual forum took place amid a wave of sexual misconduct claims against prominent figures in entertainment, politics and the media — including her former NBC “Today Show” co-host, Matt Lauer.  “I’ve been very fortunate in terms of not being subjected to a lot of sexual misconduct, but certainly I have been subjected to widely held attitudes about women, about compartmentalizing women,” Couric said when asked about career obstacles by Carolyn Tastad, president of P&G’s North America business group, in the forum’s keynote discussion.  Couric cited the frequent descriptions of her as “cute” and “perky,” which she found “marginalizing.” She joked that on her tombstone, it will say “Perky No More.”  She also recalled public critiques of her clothing when she began hosting “CBS Evening News,” and a jarring moment early in her career when she walked into a meeting at CNN and an executive said of her to others around the table: “She’s successful because of her hard work, intelligence and breast size.”  Couric said with support from her supervisor, a male anchor, she wrote to the executive and he soon called her, “dripping with apologies.”  Couric described the #MeToo movement as like “a long-dormant volcano that’s erupting” and said it’s important for men to be part of open discussions on gender issues, on how to make things better. But she said she thinks it “just feels almost too red-hot” for some to have such discussions publicly yet.  Couric has said she had been unaware of the misconduct allegations that led to Lauer’s ouster last year.  ___  Follow Dan Sewell at http://www.twitter.com/dansewell	1
His marriage may be over, but Justin Theroux certainly isn't short on female company.  The 46-year-old was spotted flaunting his chiseled abs to Emma Stone, 29, on Wednesday.

While those two animals juxtaposed might for most people conjure an epic battle to the death in a recent viral video from Brooklyn, Justin recently explained the tat was somehow dedicated to his dogs.

    Dropping hints. Long Island Medium star Theresa Caputo opened up about her problematic relationship with husband Larry during the current season of the hit TLC show before shocking fans with the announcement of their split on Sunday, December 3.  “Since the last season of Long Island Medium, Larry and I’s relationship has changed,” Theresa, 51, revealed to a friend on the November 13 episode. “We’ve been there for each other, you know, through thick and thin, you know, good times, and right now are not such great times. I don’t understand it. I lay in bed, and I say to myself, ‘How did this happen? How did I get here?’”  “I sometimes interpret it as growing apart,” the reality star said of their almost three-decade-long marriage during a confessional in the same episode. “I’ve changed and he has changed. We’re both not happy and, you know, it’s hard to try to work through that.”  The medium, who has starred on Long Island Medium with her family since 2011, also broke down on the November 27 episode during a reading.  “I’m gonna say something, and I’m gonna regret it,” a teary Theresa said, walking off camera. “Things happen. I can’t, I can’t do this.”  “I’m in the middle of a reading with Erin and my own emotions about my relationship with Larry got the best of me,” she later explained. “This is a really hard time right now with Larry and I, and I don’t know what’s going to happen.

"Last week, we discussed the incendiary report from an industry insider that says that Kendall Jenner is pregnant and that she's been canceling modeling gigs to hide the baby bump.  Kendall is the only one of Kris Jenner's children to have not yet had a child, so this idea has a lot of people very excited.  But is she pregnant? Let's take a look at the evidence.  Reportedly, during a call to set up a modeling shoot, it was confided by a photographer that Kendall Jenner is not modeling at the moment.  She's a supermodel who makes, like, $20 million a year from doing shoots. So that might strike people as odd.  But the photographer reportedly claimed -- on a private call -- that Kendall is taking this quiet leave of absence because she is pregnant.  We have stressed from the beginning that this is not confirmed. It's not even a firsthand report of hearing the statement.  But ... some people have pointed out that probably is how something like this would leak.  As in, not from someone who could be directly traced to the knowledge, but from someone who heard it from a friend or coworker.  If Kendall really is pregnant, it is widely expected that the baby daddy would be Blake Griffin.  But many who may hope to see Kendall and Blake produce yet another beautiful grandchild for Kris Jenner to love and monetize, Gossip Cop reports that they have a statement on record from Kendall's representative.  ""Kendall is not pregnant.""  That was crushing for many to hear.  At the same time, some wonder if they should trust an official statement.  After all, last year, both Kylie and Khloe were bizarrely coy about their pregnancies for months.  While it is totally their right to tell people about their bodies if and when they see fit, a number of fans feels that they are less willing to trust official statements as a result.  So let's look at some clues, instead.  Just a few weeks ago, Kendall Jenner shared this photo.  In the caption, she writes: ""The party Gods got me.""  We don't think that she's announcing to her fans that she was kidnapped by Dionysus and has only just returned from an otherworldly realm of merrymaking.  Instead, and coupled with the photo, this was widely interpreted as an announcement that she was suffering from a major hangover.  Hey, it happens.  Naturally, if Kendall were pregnant, one would absolutely hope that she is not drinking anything, let alone drinking enough to give herself a hangover.  (Fetal Alcohol Syndrome is no joke, folks)  Additionally, Kendall and Blake have been spotted together, out and about.  That in and of itself has done nothing to quell rumors that they're having a child together.  But those who have seen Kendall have noted that, just as in the recent photos of her that we have pointed out, Kendall is showing no sign of a baby bump.  Additionally, Kendall has stated recently -- what with all of the chatter about Kylie giving birth to sweet baby Stormi -- that she doesn't plan on having any kids until her late twenties.  She is, again, only 22. This is a very sensible plan on her part.  So it looks like her flat tummy will be here for years to come.  We do find ourselves wondering where the claim that she's pregnant originated.  Did someone make an offhand remark or a poorly phrased joke that others took seriously?  We may never know.  We can only imagine how amazing it would be if Kendall were pregnant with Blake Griffin's baby.  And we have the perfect name suggestion for her child.  Pepsi Griffin."	0
"Kaley Cuoco isn't holding anything back.  Sporting a lavender Alice + Olivia by Stacey Bendet dress with Giuseppe Zanotti heels and Odette New York Earrings, the Big Bang Theory star looks fierce and fabulous on the cover of Cosmopolitan's May issue. In her accompanying interview with the magazine, she opens up about her first marriage with Ryan Sweeting -- and what led to their divorce.  Cuoco, 32, and Sweeting, 30, became engaged in September 2013 after three months of dating, and tied the knot on Dec. 31, 2013, in Santa Susana, California. They announced they were going their separate ways in September 2015, and according to Cuoco, it was all Sweeting's doing.  ""I honestly thought I wouldn’t get married again,"" Kuoco, who's currently planning her wedding with fiancé Karl Cook, recalls. ""My ex ruined that word for me.""  ""I married someone the first time who completely changed,"" she continues. ""The person I ended up with was not the person I originally met. And that wasn’t my fault -- that was his. I knew how much I had to give and how much I wanted to receive. I knew I just had to be patient…I had to go through a lot of things, but it brought me to Karl.""  Jason Kim/Cosmopolitan  Clearly, Cuoco has moved past heartbreak and found love again with Cook, who she started dating in late 2016. While she seems to be head-over-heels for the equestrian, she's also focusing on running her own production company, Yes, Norman Productions.  ""I want to be a full-on girl boss,"" she exclaims. ""I've been in the business so long, and I've worked with the best. I don't let people mess with me. I want to show girls out there that you can be cool, wear yoga clothes, and run your own f**king company. You don't have to be a guy in a suit.""  ""I want this to be a big company,"" she adds. ""I want to be sitting down a few years from now and have so many projects going. That's what I'm excited about.""  Jason Kim/Cosmopolitan  But right now, wedding planning comes first! Cuoco announced last November that Cook had popped the question, and the two celebrated with a trip to Disneyland in Anaheim, California, a few weeks later. ""He took me to Disneyland and it was pure magic,"" Cuoco shared on Instagram at the time. ""Mad love for this group that surrounds me!""  ET caught up with Cuoco at the Stand Up for Pits Benefit in Hollywood, California, just a few weeks before Cook got down on one knee. Cuoco seemed smitten by her beau, telling us he was ""totally the guy"" for her.  ""I think the common denominator is the horses, it just works for us,"" she said of her and Cook's shared passion for equestrian and animals. ""We have this special bond so, yeah, the animals. He's so real. I've never met a kinder human being, he's gentle, and he's real. I'm completely in love with him. Nothing could be better.""  Hear more from the exclusive interview in the video below!

He's used to fans falling over themselves at his every word.  But Justin Bieber came unstuck on Sunday at the BST Hyde Park concert with a shaky performance which left a packed crowd baffled.  During his set, the pop singer revealed he had stuck vapour rub up his nose before getting into a funk when a joke he cracked was met with a stony silence - leaving the singer to quip: 'I'm having a bad night don't judge me.'  Scroll down for video  Justin Bieber came unstuck on Sunday at the BST Hyde Park concert with a nightmare performance which left a packed crowd scratching their heads.  And things went from bad to worse when he publicly scolded his backing singers for talking in-between songs, sneering: 'Whatever you're talking about can't be more important than what I'm saying,' leaving his audience stunned.  The problems began early when the Sorry hit-maker pointed out the Merry-go-round near the stage and joked: 'That looks fun... Said no one ever!'  Sadly, the discerning British crowd failed to see the funny side of Bieber's wisecrack leaving him to awkwardly tap his microphone and quip: 'Is this thing on?' before adding: 'Tough crowd!'  In the singer's defense, it appears as if he was nursing a cold.  Bad night at the office: During the botched performance, the pop singer revealed he had vapour rub stuck up his nose before getting into a huff when a joke he cracked was met with a stony silence  Whoops: Bieber told the crowd 'I'm having a bad night, don't judge me'  Explaining to fans that he was bunged up and had to use Vicks Vapour in order to perform.  'I usually use Olbus oil' he told the confused audience. 'But I had to use Vicks here and now and it's stuck up my nose,' he continued.  Finally adding: 'I'm having a bad night, don't judge me.'  Dressed in a red Louis Vuitton X Supreme baseball shirt, the singer donned a pair of loose fittign basketball shorts and Adidas trainers in order to aid his usually upbeat performance.  Previous form: In 2016 he stormed off stage in Manchester when fans refused to storm screaming when he sang  Angry: 'People tend to want to shut you down. What I mean by that is … people try to twist things, some people don't want to listen'  Doubling down: In a later post on Instagram he reiterated his point, writing 'People tend to want to shut you down. What I mean by that is … people try to twist things'  Another look: Justin later made an outfit change as he took to the stage at BST Hyde Park  Professional: Despite his prior performance, Justin continued to be in the zone as he belted out his hit tunes  The Sorry artist has form when it comes to hit and miss gigs.  In 2016 he stormed off stage in Manchester when fans refused to storm screaming when he sang.  Scolding the crowd, he said: 'Just try to show me you love me, in a different way. I get it. The screaming is just so obnoxious. I get it, it's been in our blood and it's been grand, you go to a concert and scream and stuff.  'But if we could just ... scream after the song, enjoy the songs ... the screaming is awesome, it's fine, and then we take a chill pill for a second and we just listen to me speak.  'Because ... I don't feel like I'm being heard sometimes and it's getting a little pressuring. So, if when I'm speaking you guys could not scream at the top of your lungs. Is that cool with you guys?'  In a later post on Instagram he reiterated his point, writing: 'People tend to want to shut you down. What I mean by that is … people try to twist things, some people don't want to listen.  'But I simply feel like, if I didn't use this platform to say how I truly feel, and if I didn't use this platform to be the man that I know I am, and speak from what's in my heart, then I'm doing myself injustice, and I'm not doing anybody in this audience any justice.

"In case you missed it, on this season of The Bachelor, Arie Luyendyk Jr. first proposed to Becca Kufrin, then broke up with her while cameras were filming, then went back to the woman he initially rejected, Lauren Burnham, and now they're engaged. (Phew!) Now that the dust has settled, Arie explained during an interview on Good Morning America that he filmed the breakup to show the world that this was his fault, not Becca’s, so she could go on to be the next star of The Bachelorette:  ""I really wanted everyone to know that this was on me. This was my fault, and I felt like filming that would let people know that, that if there were any questions on the breakup, those would be squashed if they saw the breakup. And I wanted her that opportunity, honestly, I wanted her that opportunity to be the potential Bachelorette.""  Becca and Arie hash it out on After the Final Rose. ABC  Arie also said that he felt pressure to propose during The Bachelor’s taping, even though he wasn’t fully sure about it. “As a Bachelor, there’s a timeline. And for me, there was a lot of pressure on that day, being the Bachelor, and to propose, that’s sort of what’s expected in a way,” he told host Michael Strahan. “I was really conflicted, and I felt in the moment that was the right decision, and it honestly wasn’t.” He said he started to regret his decision right after getting home from Peru, where the proposal was filmed. “In hindsight, no, I shouldn’t have proposed,” Arie said.  He told Strahan he hadn’t seen Becca since their breakup, until he apologized to her on After the Final Rose. “I hope I gave her a little bit of closure,” he said. “I’m very happy for her, I’m happy that she’s going to be able to find her true love through the show.”  That said, E! asked Chris Harrison to weigh in on Arie's spin, and he shut it down: ""That's a decision that the Bachelors are never involved in,"" Harrison said of the producers' process in picking the Bachelorette. So there you go."	1

"It's been over a year since we first learned that Sofia Richie is dating Scott Disick.  It's one of those relationships that's tough to wrap your head around, and not just because of the massive age gap.  Sure, Scott is 15 years Sofia's senior, but that wouldn't be so strange if they were 40 and 55.  At 20 and 35, however, it's a little odd.  Here, we have a woman who can't even legally purchase a cocktail in a serious relationship with a man who has three kids by his baby mama -- who's been famous since Sofia was in grade school.  It's an unusual situation, to put it mildly.  And now that Kourtney Kardashian has dumped Younes Bendjima, the whole scenario might get even weirder.  You see, rumor has it that Sofia feels threatened by Kourtney.  Sources say she's constantly worried about Scott leaving her to try and make his family whole again.  And now that Kourtney is back on the market, her concerns might be justified.  “Sofia is furious that Scott and Kourtney are hanging out again,” one insider tells In Touch Weekly.  “She understands that they have to remain civil for the kids but has become convinced that Kourtney is trying to steal back her man.""  Sofia is reportedly so worried about the situation that she's taken steps to try and ensure that  ""She recently reached out to her and told her to back off,"" says the source.  As for the Lord himself, it seems Scott feels that he's stuck between a rock and a hard place.  “Scott’s caught in the middle,” the insider claims.  “He loves Sofia but will always have a soft spot for Kourtney.”  Those who know Scott best say that as much as he's enamored with Sofia, those feelings will eventually go stale, and he'll come running back to Kourtney.  In fact, Scott recently revealed that he's considered reconciling with Kourtney.  ""We always said we'd try to get back together when we're 40,"" he said on an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.  Considering Kourtney is currently 39, Sofia may have real cause for concern.  Hopefully, if the relationship fizzles, she'll quickly realize she dodged a bullet by not ending up with Scott."	0

""So I have to go to New York from Costa Rica, from our family trip, to go meet with the French judge, so that I don't have to go to Paris.""  ""Knowing that it's a possibility that people close to me were involved makes me feel like I can't trust anyone, and that really sucks,"" Kim later says to the camera. ""It just opened up my eyes that this happens and that there's, you know, really bad people in this world. I can still live my life, but just on edge.""

Editorial credit: Kobby Dagan / Shutterstock.com  On Tuesday’s episode of her show, Wendy Williams mocked Kim Kardashian for still posting naked photos on social media. “Kim, it’s clear Kanye has nothing for you except dribble and feeble conversation,” she declared. “It is clear that Kanye does not pay attention to you. It’s clear to me that you’re desperately trying to stay in the spotlight.” She continued, “Kanye makes money, Kim makes more, why are you still doing this? It’s not even about the mother thing, forget the mother thing, because a lot of people will say, ‘Oh, she’s a mother.’ It’s about, she doesn’t have to do that anymore. That would be like Cardi B returning to the poll on a Saturday night or something like that.  “Wendy Williams Slams Kim Kardashian Over Her NSFW Photos: ’’It’s Apparent Kanye Has Nothing for You’’ | E!

"The ex-girlfriend of Teen Mom 2's Kailyn Lowry says the reality star repeatedly lied both to her, and the public, about the nature of their relationship.  Dominique Potter, a 22-year-old teacher, paints a picture of repeated deception over her three-month relationship with the MTV star.  'Nothing adds up with her,' Potter told Radar Thursday.  Scroll below for video  'Nothing adds up with her': Dominique Potter, 22, the ex-girlfriend of Teen Mom 2's Kailyn Lowry, 26, says the reality star repeatedly lied both to her, and the public, about the nature of their relationship  Potter said that she and Lowry, 26, 'met two years ago at a private event in Jersey,' and officially became a couple that November while on a trip to Atlanta, Georgia.  'November 14 was the actual day. She wanted the title,' Potter said of the Nazareth, Pennsylvania native, who has three sons: Isaac Elliot, eight, with ex-boyfriend Jo Rivera; four-year-old Lincoln Marshall, with her ex-husband Javi Marroquin; and nine-month-old son Lux Russell, with ex Chris Lopez.  Potter said Lowry seemed to have a drastic change of heart about 'a month into the relationship' - and became more secretive.  'Over Christmas break, I spent almost three weeks to a month at her house,' Potter said. 'She used to share her location with me. I got an alert on my phone that said Kail stopped sharing her location.  Better times: Potter, a teacher by trade, posed in a bookstore browsing at a copy of one of Lowry's books  Short-lived: Potter's relationship with the Teen Mom personality spanned from November to February, and was fraught with problems throughout  'She said, ""I turned my location off for everything."" Then she was like, ""I don’t trust you, I was mad at you, that’s why I stopped sharing with you."" Something wasn’t right.'  Potter said that 'articles started coming out in January that we broke up and [she] questioned her about it and she said, ""Just leave it alone.""  'I went with that. Whatever she said, I believed it.'  Covering her tracks? Lowry, seen here in Miami, set off alarms with Potter when she turned off her location tracking on her phone  By February, the pair had already split due to 'trust issues' and quickly reunited - but this time, Potter said Lowry was reluctant to tell the public in what she believed was a bid for attention.  'If people think you’re single, they’re going to flirt with you,' Potter said. 'She didn’t want to lose that constant attention from other people.'  She added, 'If she’s doing something else, that’s why she doesn’t want people knowing she’s in a relationship. She’s telling the world she’s single, of course no one is going to respect our relationship if no one knows it exists. She was keeping her cards open.'  Potter said that Lowry 'did cheat on' her with Marroquin while they were still in a relationship in January.  'She said they hooked up,' Potter said. 'She said they even discussed hooking up.'"	1
Expanding their brood! Seth Meyers’ wife, Alexi Ashe, is pregnant and expecting the couple’s second child together.  Meyers announced the news on Thursday, November 23, during the Thanksgiving episode of Late Night With Seth Meyers, alongside his parents, Larry and Hilary Meyers, and his brother Josh, who were his guests on the show.  “I want to take this opportunity now, you guys obviously know, my wife and I are expecting a second baby,” the late-night host said. “Very excited. Thank you! Very excited.”  His mother told the audience the story of when her son called her to give her the good news. “I get the phone call, and my Seth is sometimes a crier. He’s sobbing,” she said. “He said, ‘Because for over a month, I’ve had to pretend that I don’t care what sex it is and I do care, I want a little boy!’”  The comedian, who welcomed his first son Ashe in 2016, said: “That’s true, I really wanted a brother for my son because I was so lucky to have one.”  The Saturday Night Live alum, 43, and the human rights lawyer announced their first pregnancy in September 2015 while attending New York’s Natural History Museum Gala.  “They are so thrilled to become parents and were so happy to share the exciting news with friends and cast members from SNL last night,” a source exclusively told Us Weekly at the time.  The couple wed in September 2013 in front of family and friends at Martha’s Vineyard in Massachusetts. Although the late-night host typically holds back from commenting on his marriage, he did share a sweet memory back in 2014 of Ashe trying on her wedding gown.  “I will never forget the first time she returned from her fitting because she was happier than I’ve ever seen her,” Meyers gushed at the time while attending a NYC luncheon. “Which was a little jarring for me because I had recently proposed to her. Turns out getting a ring from me is less exciting than having Carolina Herrera creating your dress.”  The Late Night With Seth Meyers host also poked fun at Ashe for having food poising the night before their nuptials. “In a testament to my wife’s will and my wife’s strength, she got herself pumped full of fluids, and she railed it and made it to the ceremony,” he said. “When she walked out in her Herrera wedding dress, she looked more beautiful than I had ever seen her look.”	1
"Milana Vayntrub ('This Is Us') and Derek Theler ('Baby Daddy') lead the ensemble cast of the straight-to-series Freeform comedy.  Three months after being picked up straight to series by Freeform, Marvel's New Warriors has found its cast.  Milana Vayntrub (This Is Us) has landed the breakout role of Squirrel Girl, while Baby Daddy grad Derek Theler will stay in business with Freeform after landing the role of Mister Immortal in Marvel's first live-action scripted comedy.  The duo lead the ensemble cast in the 10-episode series about six young people learning to cope with their abilities in a world where bad guys can be as terrifying as bad dates. Joining Vayntrub and Theler are Jeremy Tardy as Night Thrasher, Calum Worthy as Speedball, Matthew Moy as Microbe and Kate Comer as Debrii.  ""I am thrilled beyond belief to be working with this incredible group of actors. They are funny, sincere, eager, charming and perfectly embody these characters. It'll be a blast and an honor to create this show with each of them,"" said showrunner — and longtime Squirrel Girl superfan — Kevin Biegel (Enlisted).  Picked up straight to series in April, New Warriors hails from Marvel Television and ABC Studios' cable arm ABC Signature. Marvel head of TV Jeph Loeb and Jim Chory executive produce alongside Biegel.  ""We're so lucky to have assembled such a diverse and incredibly talented cast,"" Loeb said. ""We can't wait for the fans to see what's in store when we unleash these iconic characters into the world!""  The Squirrel Girl casting caps an extensive process that featured a personal campaign from Stranger Things breakout Shannon Purser (Barb) — who sources say was also in the running. Parenthood grad Mae Whitman — another outspoken fan of the character — was also discussed, sources say, but her series regular commitment to NBC's upcoming Good Girls made that conversation short, though sources say the character was written with the actress in mind. Other actresses, including Anna Kendrick, had also expressed interest in taking on the character.  ""At Freeform, we are committed to finding distinct and entertaining characters that our audience can enjoy and relate to,"" said Elizabeth Boykewich, senior vp casting and talent at Freeform. ""We are excited to be working with Marvel Television to bring these fiercely average superheroes to life and watch them take on the world.""  New Warriors will launch in 2018. It is Freeform's second Marvel series and joins Cloak and Dagger at the Disney-owned network. It is unclear if both series will launch at the same time and whether they would be paired together. For more on how the series fits in with the Marvel universe as well as at Freeform, read THR's interview with exec vp programming and development Karey Burke.  Read the full character descriptions below.  Vayntrub (who recurred on NBC's This Is Us as Kevin's Broadway co-star Sloane) will take on Doreen Green — aka Squirrel Girl. Doreen is a totally empowered fangirl who has the incredible powers of a ... squirrel. Her greatest quality is her optimism and her best friend is a pet squirrel, Tippy Toe. Vayntrub is repped by UTA and Ziffren Brittenham.  Theler, who wrapped his six-season starring role on Freeform's Baby Daddy in May, is Craig Hollis, aka Mister Immortal. Craig can't die ... or so he says. Although Craig's superpower seems amazing, he hasn't made use of it at all — he figures if he has all the time in the world to learn how to do anything heroic, what's the rush? Theler is with Paradigm, Authentic Talent and Literary Management and Sloane Offer.  Tardy (Dear White People) takes on the role of Dwayne Taylor, aka Night Thrasher. Brilliant and noble and maybe a bit full of himself, Dwayne is a shameless self-promoter and entrepreneur who also deeply believes in justice. Tardy is with the Kohner Agency and Generate.  Worthy (Austin & Ally, Cassandra French's Finishing School) will play Robbie Baldwin, aka Speedball. Robbie is an impulsive people-plea"	1
Real-life Prince Charming buys his wife the Disney bench that he proposed on  Thursday, July 20, 2017  SEATTLE — If you needed proof that fairytales are real, just listen to Ryan Macedo’s story.  Macedo, who shared his ultra-romantic tale with E! News, met his wife Carla on a flight from San Diego back home to Seattle in May 2016. Both doctors, they hit it off immediately and, in fact, called their respective moms after they landed to tell them they had just met the person they would marry.  Just two months later, Macedo decided to pop the question during a trip to Disneyland. He originally planned to ask Carla inside Beast’s library at Disney California Adventure, but instead managed to convince employees to let them into the VIP sections during the nightly fireworks show where they were given more privacy.  His proposal went something like this: “On May 29th, I left my heart in the hands of the most beautiful woman I have ever met on Delta flight [number], so now I want to spend the rest of my life protecting your heart the way you’ve protected mine.”  Sigh!  Of course, Carla said yes and the couple tied the knot in December. But the fairytale only gets better from there!  For Carla’s birthday this year, Macedo came up with the brilliant (and swoon-worthy) idea of buying the actual Disneyland bench he proposed on the year before. He called up Disneyland and explained his somewhat odd request to employees.  “The first several people had no idea what I was trying to do,” he told E! News, “but I finally got a hold of the right person that said, ‘Well, the same bench is put in that same spot every night’. And I said, ‘I want it disassembled and I want it mailed to me. I’ll pay whatever it costs’.”  Since Disney is in the business of making dreams come true, they were able to follow through with Macedo’s request. The bench was shipped to Macedo’s home and he quickly went about re-assembling it in their backyard. When Carla arrived home, he blindfolded her and surprised her with what she instantly recognized as “their” bench.  And the best part? Disney had custom-designed a placard that read, “Once upon a time in a magical kingdom in front of an enchanted castle on this very bench on July 18, 2016, Ryan asked Carla to be his bride. Fireworks shot through the sky, with tears in her eyes Carla said yes. Ryan was overcome with joy and they lived happily ever after”.  See? Fairytales are real. Now the only thing for Macedo to do is to buy the plane they met on.	1

We rifled through the beauty chameleon's make-up bag to find out the secrets to looking that damn good...  On foundation...  Revlon's 24-hour Wear Colorstay Foundation is epic because it goes on really sheer and doesn't get chunky at all. You know how sometimes it creases and builds up? Well, not with the Colorstay. And there's a little bit of SPF in it - I believe in sunblock wholeheartedly.  On lipliner...  I'm also obsessed with lip liners. I love not over drawing my lips but doing just enough to make my lips look extra juicy. My favourite colour is Revlon's 'Spicy', darling!  On highlighter...  I can't live without highlighter. I think every girl needs it. It's one of the last things I do when applying my make-up - I'll put it on the highest part of my cheekbone, around the outside of my eye – sometimes just working in it to just above my eyebrow ever so slightly, so it creates a moon shape around my eye.  Then I take a little cotton bud and put it on the inside of my eye and brush it right above my lips. It's very sexy there.  On eyeliner...  You're going to see me in a lot of graphic eyeliner this season. Revlon has this great eyeliner which is a wheel [ColorStay Exactify Liquid Liner] - I can't do eyeliner to save my life but the wheel makes it so easy. Even so, I try to do a cat eye but I don't know how to! Yesterday, I did a cat-eye shape that wasn't exactly filled in...	1
Don’t worry Katie, Jamie’s got your back (Picture: PPLOS/The Mega Agency)  If you needed any confirmation that Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx are a definitely couple, then it’s right here.  The loved-up pair enjoyed a beach date in Malibu on Friday and couldn’t help but pack on the PDA, sharing their first public kiss.  So adorable.  Katie, 39, did not wipe the smile off her face as she frolicked and cuddled the Oscar-winning actor in front of fellow beachgoers. Proving to be quite the playful couple, Jamie, 50, at one point is seen scooping the Kennedys actress into his arms and bending her over his arms before collapsing onto the floor.  While Jamie is usually the life and soul of the party, Katie took the chance to entertain the comedian by doing cartwheels across the sand and pulling gymnastic poses.  Get a beach, guys (PPLOS/ The Mega Agency)  After battling each other at a game of volleyball, the smitten couple were then pictured laying on a blanket and kissing, marking a rare moment of affection for the notoriously private couple.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The lovebirds later watched the stunning ocean view while sipping cups of champagne which they brought along with their picnic. Date goals!  Katie and Jamie are believed to have been dating for five years but photos of them together have only emerged in the past year. Perhaps their most high-profile outing to date, the couple sat together at Clive Davis’ Pre-Grammys Awards Gala in February and were the picture of romantic bliss.  It is alleged that Katie was keen to keep their romance under wraps following her widely-publicised divorce from ex-husband Tom Cruise in 2012.  No doubt Katie and Jamie relished in some alone time given their busy family life and work schedules. Katie is mother to 11-year-old daughter Suri, whom she shares with Tom, while Jamie is a father to daughters Corinne, 24, and nine-year-old Annalise, from previous relationships.  The happy date photos appear to shoot down recent reports that Katie and Jamie had split.  A recent report by Radar Online claimed the relationship had ended due to ‘trust issues’. Although they have never confirmed their romance, a rep for Katie told People that the reports of a break-up ‘100 percent untrue’.  Got a showbiz story?

But Gossip Cop checked in with a rep for Flo Rida, who exclusively assures us the rapper simply won’t be performing at Trump’s inauguration, and this is a non-story.

"Four-year-old Prince George may be ahead of his little sister Princess Charlotte in line for the throne, but she’s clearly the ruler at home.  That's according to their great-grandmother Queen Elizabeth II, who noted the power balance between the young royal siblings during a meeting on Sunday at her Sandringham estate in Norfolk, England. The queen was presenting a Bible she signed to a 10-year-old student who won a contest for the best religious studies project at her school when the funny exchange took place.  Trending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service  The 91-year-old monarch asked the student if she “looked after” her younger sister. The girl’s mom jumped in saying: “It’s the other way around,"" according to the Daily Mail.  The queen replied, “It’s like that with Charlotte and George,” noting how the 2-year-old princess keeps a watchful eye over her older brother, the prince.  Bossy Princess Charlotte? Quite so, says Queen Elizabeth! The Duchess of Cambridge / EPA  According to the father of the lucky student, who won the same prize as his daughter in 1990, Charlotte's inclination to watch over her older brother is typical sibling behavior.  ""It is often the case that a younger child is more confident,"" he said at the event. ""It is second child syndrome.""  Princess Charlotte looks out fro the balcony of Buckingham Palace with her brother and parents during last year's Trooping the Colour parade. Chris Jackson / Getty Images  This shouldn’t be a complete shocker for royal family fans. Last year, the Duchess of Cambridge reportedly told a fellow mom that her daughter Charlotte was “the one in charge” at home.  And last fall, Prince William The Duke of Cambridge, her father, joked that his daughter is “going to be trouble when she gets older.”  The young princess, who recently started nursery school, will get plenty of chances to look after her big brother when their parents head to Sweden and Norway for a four-day visit later this month."	1

Brad Pitt has faced several ups and downs since his ex Angelina Jolie filed for divorce in 2016, but dealing with the end of his marriage has not caused the actor to seek sobriety support from his rumored girlfriend Neri Oxman.  A new report claiming the “Fury” actor has been leaning on his girlfriend to help him stay clean amid his struggle with alcohol abuse is false.  A source close to the actor told Gossip Cop Oxman isn’t involved in that aspect of his life. The RadarOnline article alleges the MIT professor “has been a great influence” on the actor and is “extremely supportive” of his sobriety.  “She is about as straight-laced as they come… Neri is a firm believer that people should not put anything into their bodies that does not belong,” a “source” told the site.  Pitt first admitted he gave up alcohol during a 2017 interview with GQ. The actor revealed he was an avid drinker and smoker for more than half his life but was motivated to stop following his divorce.  “I mean I stopped everything except boozing when I started my family. But even this last year, you know—things I wasn't dealing with. I was boozing too much. It’s just become a problem. And I'm really happy it’s been half a year now, which is bittersweet, but I’ve got my feelings in my fingertips again,” he told the publication.  While the false report alleges Oxman has been a key factor in keeping Pitt from falling off the wagon, Gossip Cop noted another publication had already reported that the actor had actually already worked out a strategy to maintain his sobriety.  “He goes to therapy every week and is mostly interested in learning and bettering himself as a man and father,” a source told Us Weekly in January.  Pitt continues to remain committed to the six children--Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 9-- he shares with Jolie. The actor is reportedly expected to spend his summer in Los Angeles to be closer to them as he and the actress hammer out a divorce settlement.  Photo: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images	0

On the show, though, June is so special that her scowl might as well be on the currency for the revolution. Her husband confronts her captor in Canada. She delivers her own baby. Even though people died to help her escape at the beginning of the season, she’s determined now to stay in Gilead, because I guess Season 3 has to be about something. One read is that there’s no escaping the suffocation of a subjugating regime. Except within the show, there actually is escaping it — and yet June has decided not to.  Season 2 has been dutifully brutal, complete with ample torture, rapes, executions and murders. It gave in to every one of the show’s most tedious instincts, substituting slow stares and endless montage sequences for any actual development or new interiority. Every inch of existence is awful. Cookies are inedible. Oprah is in exile. We’re at the North Pole of misery and being told to walk north.  So all the show can do is walk in circles. June’s primal wound is being separated from her daughter Hannah. That can’t be heightened on, so instead, Season 2 just repeats it. This, too, could seem eerily resonant, given the human rights crisis at the Mexican border that saw immigrant children being separated from their parents. But not entirely, because one essential flash point of present-day America “The Handmaid’s Tale” ignores is race and ethnicity. Our United States definitely does not.  June’s trauma repeats, and so does everyone else’s. June’s pal Emily (Alexis Bledel), who last season was punished by having her clitoris cut off, was sent to the gulag, as was Janine (Madeline Brewer), who last season had her eye removed. After they toiled for a few episodes, it was back to Gilead for them both — back to desultory trips to the market and conspiratorial whispers. Would Nick’s child bride ruin everything? No; she was executed, and then everything was back to bad-normal.	1

Skier Lindsey Vonn leaves the 2018 Winter Olympics with lots of tweets but just one medal  PYEONGCHANG, South Korea —Twitter trolls might be the only ones excited to hear this, but it’s the truth: On the slopes, Lindsey Vonn was a bust at the 2018 Winter Olympics.    She arrived here widely considered the best female Alpine skier ever, primed for a gold medal in the downhill and poised to win another medal in the Super-G.    She will head home with a measly bronze.    Before the women’s combined event Thursday, when Vonn was disqualified after missing a gate in the slalom portion of the race, she tweeted, “Man I forgot to wear deodorant today... if I hug you don’t judge me.’’    Funny, the odor after the race smelled like rationalization.    “I’ve been injured so many times that the fact I’m even here is a victory in itself,’’ Vonn, 33, told reporters after what her last race of the Pyeongchang Games and likely the final race of her Olympics career. “As a racer, as a person I have to remember that as well because I do want to win and I’m usually not satisfied with a bronze. In this situation, I think I can be very happy with what I’ve accomplished.’’  More: Mikaela Shiffrin takes silver in Alpine combined while Lindsey Vonn fails to medal  More: U.S. women end Canada's streak to win hockey gold in shootout at 2018 Winter Olympics  That’s Vonn’s prerogative. But no reason for anyone else to feel compelled to celebrate her Olympic performance — bronze in the downhill, sixth in the Super-G and did not finish (DNF) in the combined — with chants of “U-S-A! U-S-A!” Although her injuries are undeniable, she was healthy enough to have won the last two World Cup downhill races before the Olympics and even her own father, Alan Kildow, sounded underwhelmed with the bronze medal.    “It’s great skiing, but it reminds me of something that Buddy Werner used to say,’’ Kildow told USA TODAY Sports, referring the U.S. Alpine skier who raced in the 1950s and 1960s. “He said there’s two places in the race, first and last, and I only want one of them.’’  This is almost without a doubt her final Olympics; she has basically said that herself. She will stay on the World Cup circuit for a while. She needs six World Cup victories to pass Ingemar Stenmark’s record of 86. She is a three-time Olympic medalist. And with her bronze in the downhill, the 33-year-old became the oldest skier to win a medal in an Alpine event.  Vonn won Olympic gold in the downhill at the 2010 Games and, after missing the 2014 Olympics because of a knee injury, this was a chance to gild her stellar racing career with another Olympic gold. Yet it’s fair to wonder if she was distracted.    At times, it felt as if she spent as much time on Twitter as she did on the slopes. The highlights: She tweeted about looking for a Valentine’s Date, tweeted about the Trump-loving trolls attacking her and, well, then there was that missing deodorant.    Most reporters (present company included) ate it up. And with the media, she was gracious, articulate, candid, funny and generous with her time. Too bad for Vonn there was no Olympic medal awarded for that.    It was the one gold she deserved.        	1
If it isn’t pregnancy rumors Jennifer Aniston is the subject of, the beauty is making tabloid headlines for her apparent troubled relationship with her husband, Justin Theroux. Even an open letter in the Huffington Post pleading that the tabloids stop reporting false stories about her and her marriage has not managed to take tabloid focus off the star.  Although the pregnancy rumors have halted since Jen penned the letter in the publication, she remains the subject of falsities about her marriage and has recently admitted that she feels although the essay did make media members more aware of the affects such falsities have on celebrities and the manner that women are discussed in the media, that it did little to halt the fabricated tales from making the front page about she and other female figures in the spotlight.  The beauty spoke with Variety recently on the topic as Vanity Fair relays.  “I had no idea it would get the response that it did; I was thrilled with that. But sadly, people still buy into it. They are consumers of this trash and they eat it up. It’s definitely in people’s consciousness a lot more. But you’re always going to have the Piers Morgans of the world contradicting something that comes from the heart and saying, ‘You’re a hypocrite.”  Aniston’s point is validated by recent rumors that claimed Jen and Justin had a blowout fight at actor Orlando Bloom’s birthday celebration. In Touch has ignited this rumor, as Gossip Cop shares. The tabloid claims that the couple had a “miserable night out” while at Bloom’s 40th in Palm Springs. The gossip policing site shares the claims by the tabloid.  “At one point, Justin was having a blast with Orlando and Leo [DiCaprio]. But Jen obviously didn’t like that they were stealing his attention away from her, so she walked over and took Justin’s hand and pulled him away.”  The insider adds that Aniston “… would pout and get angry any time Justin started to have fun… Justin’s pals actually felt bad for him.” The insider adds that Jen “is always monitoring Justin’s life, and no one can take it anymore. His friends have told him enough is enough.”  Jennifer Aniston, Justin Theroux Not Caught Openly Fighting At Orlando Bloom’s Birthday Party, Despite Report https://t.co/sup8sK42He — Gossip Cop (@GossipCop) January 26, 2017  Loading...  GC has checked with both stars’ reps. Aniston’s rep assures that the story is “ridiculous,” while Theroux’s rep insists the claim is simply “false.” The site reminds that In Touch has reported false stories about Jen and Justin in the past, including when it alleged that the happy couple were taking a vacation to try to save their marriage.  Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux join in on the fun at Orlando Bloom’s surprise birthday party https://t.co/aVf3C4PqrO pic.twitter.com/YKEqP7bxZs — People Magazine (@people) January 16, 2017  It’s clear that those behind the false claims about Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux, and those photographers who incessantly hassle the star to snap an image that can be used to begin one of those false claims, have not heeded her words about how frustrated she is with the ludicrous claims made on the daily about she and Justin, in addition to other mainly female celebrities who endure the same treatment. Despite not being fully heeded, Aniston’s words in the Huffington Post letter “For the Record,” are certainly worth revisiting in hopes that they will one day resonate and inspire change.  “If I am some kind of symbol to some people out there, then clearly I am an example of the lens through which we, as a society, view our mothers, daughters, sisters, wives, female friends and colleagues. The objectification and scrutiny we put women through is absurd and disturbing. The way I am portrayed by the media is simply a reflection of how we see and portray women in general, measured against some warped standard of beauty.”  [Featured Image by Mark Davis/Getty Images]	0

After her mother suffered brain damage in a car accident, Haddish spent several years in foster care before going to live with her grandmother as a teenager. Her penchant for making her classmates laugh led her social worker to point her toward the Laugh Factory Comedy Camp, a free summer program offered by the comedy club chain Laugh Factory to teach underprivileged children how to perform stand-up comedy. The camp proved to be a transformative experience for Haddish.  After graduating from high school, Haddish focused on forging a career in comedy, using her life as source material.

"Kate Middleton, 36, has given birth to three children since marrying Prince William, 36, and becoming a member of the Royal Family. Being a normal girl from Berkshire, the former fashion and marketing professional had to adapt to royal life. When she did fall pregnant, Kate was not allowed to have one baby tradition other mothers in the UK will experience, a baby shower. Another royal baby is now on the way, with Meghan Markle having her first child with husband Prince Harry. With Meghan now pregnant, and hailing from the US where baby showers are the norm, will Meghan be allowed what Kate wasn’t?  Kate Middleton: The pregnancy tradition Kate was not allowed to have - will Meghan be?  Baby showers are a way for the expectant mother and those close to her to celebrate the pregnancy and upcoming birth. This happens by showering the mother-to-be with gifts, a pregnancy tradition. However, baby showers are reported to be frowned on in the Royal Family and not celebrated, as they appear to be tasteless. Speaking to People magazine, royal expert Victoria Arbiter revealed that a royal baby shower could come with “added pressure that they are clearly very wealthy.” She stated: “A lavish baby shower would be seen as highly inappropriate... there's nothing they can't go out and buy themselves"". It is believed that Kate hasn’t had a baby shower for any of her three children.  Kate has been pregnant three times, and is believed to have never had a baby shower  Back in 2013 when she was pregnant with Prince George, rumours circulated that her sister Pippa had thrown her a shower. However, these rumours were shot down by many royal experts, as the point of a shower is to receive gifts and that is something the Royal Family wouldn’t do. According to Victoria, royal protocol exists around gift giving and any gifts given to expectant royal parents must be “respectfully returned”. This means it is highly unlikely that Meghan will be having a baby shower to celebrate the upcoming birth of her first child, despite it being a US tradition. While on their royal tour of Australia, Tonga and Fiji, Meghan and Harry did receive some gifts, including a stuffed toy kangaroo and a pair of tiny Ugg boots.  Pippa was rumoured to have thrown pregnant Kate a shower, but the rumours were shot down  Meghan is now expecting her first child, and baby showers are a US tradition  It is not known as to whether or not the Sussexes had to return the kangaroo and other gifts, but they were delighted at the gifts when presented with them in Sydney. While Kate wasn’t allowed a baby shower due to her royal title, her sister Pippa might well have had one. Pippa gave birth to a baby boy last week, and following the birth a statement was released by Kensington Palace on behalf of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The statement read: “The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are thrilled for Pippa and James.” It was believed that Kate didn’t visit Pippa in the hospital, as it would've caused too much of a media circus."	1
"American reality television series  Keeping Up with the Kardashians (often abbreviated KUWTK) is an American reality television series that airs on the E! cable network. The show focuses on the personal and professional lives of the Kardashian–Jenner blended family. Its premise originated with Ryan Seacrest, who also serves as an executive producer. The series debuted on October 14, 2007, and has subsequently become one of the longest-running reality television series in the country. The sixteenth season premiered on March 31, 2019.[2] The seventeenth season premiered on September 8, 2019.[3]  The series focuses mainly on sisters Kourtney, Kim, and Khloé Kardashian and their half-sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner.

Kim's friend Jonathan Cheban and Khloé's friend Malika Haqq have also been part of the show.  Keeping Up with the Kardashians has received very poor critical reviews since its premiere. It is often criticized for the high degree of emphasis on the ""famous for being famous"" concept, and for appearing to fabricate some aspects of its storylines. Several critics also noted the show's lack of intelligence.[4] However, some critics recognized the reality series as a ""guilty pleasure"" and acknowledged the family's success. Despite the negative reviews, Keeping Up with the Kardashians has attracted high viewership ratings, becoming one of the network's most successful shows and winning several audience awards.  The series' success has led additionally to the creation of numerous spin-off series, including: Kourtney and Kim Take Miami, Kourtney and Kim Take New York, Khloé & Lamar, Kourtney and Khloé Take The Hamptons, Dash Dolls, Rob & Chyna, Life of Kylie, and Flip It Like Disick. The network has also broadcast several television specials featuring special events involving members of the family and friends.  Despite its presentation as a ""reality show"", it is widely known that many situations, including fights, two marriage proposals, and even the home where the family supposedly lives, are fake or staged.[5][6][7][8] The show is one of the longest-running U.S. cable television series with 17 seasons and over 250 episodes.[citation needed]  Background [ edit ]  Robert Kardashian (1944–2003) and Kristen Mary ""Kris"" Houghton (born 1955) married in 1978, and had four children together: daughters Kourtney (born 1979), Kim (born 1980), and Khloé (born 1984), and son Rob (born 1987). The couple divorced in 1991. In 1994, Robert rose to prominence when he defended O. J. Simpson for the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman during the O.J. Simpson trial.[9][10] In 1991, Kris married retired Olympic decathlon champion Caitlyn Jenner (born 1949; formerly known as Bruce Jenner before undergoing a gender transition in 2015).[11] Kris and Caitlyn had two daughters together, Kendall (born 1995) and Kylie (born 1997). Robert died in 2003, eight weeks after being diagnosed with esophageal cancer.[12]  The Kardashian sisters began appearing in the media spotlight more often. In the early 2000s Kim worked as a personal assistant for hotel heiress and reality TV star, Paris Hilton.[13] During her employment for Hilton, Kim briefly developed a very close friendship with Hilton during a high point in Hilton's fame. This friendship helped boost Kim's personal fame by allowing her to occasionally appear in episodes of Hilton's TV show"	0
"Drew Barrymore is grateful for her female friendships, especially with her long-time pal, Cameron Diaz.  ""We're like more than best friends, she's my sister,"" the actress and beauty mogul told ET's Lauren Zima at Beautycon Festival LA, where she was celebrating new products from her makeup line, Flower Beauty.  She continued, ""We have much more of that kind of relationship, we're very honest with each other. We push each other. And we've had the majority of our lives spent side by side, really going through what real life is, which is an everyday high and low and we just have each other's backs.""  The BFFs gave everyone friendship goals when they recently posted a makeup free selfie together, both looking glowy and happy.  Barrymore admitted that sometimes it's easier to go bare.  ""I love makeup so much, but it's like we don't have the time or energy to do it all the time, so I'm really into real life,"" she said about the selfie.  But the 43-year-old added makeup can be a powerful game changer.  ""The tiniest little bit of concealer and a lip can make such a difference in your self confidence that it's like, you do it and you think, 'Why would I never not do this?' But I'm a mom, I'm busy and we forget to put a little bit into ourselves. Even one minute, 30 seconds can just sort of boost yourself, and it's important to remember to take that time to do that,"" Barrymore said.  As for the planned reboot of Charlie's Angels, set to be directed by Elizabeth Banks and rumored to star Kristen Stewart and Lupita Nyong'o, Barrymore was supportive of the idea.  ""I'm just excited for them,"" the Santa Clarita Diet star said. ""Because every generation that brings Charlie's Angels out into the world is about the power of three women and what they can do, while loving men and wanting to date them or working side by side with them. But there's just something about Charlie's Angels that make men and women so happy.""  ""And it's so positive. So if they keep that alive in this new iteration, it's just going to be great,"" she added.  For more on Barrymore, watch the video below!

"President Trump never misses a chance to tweet his thoughts on TV ratings, and Tuesday morning he knocked Hollywood for the ""lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY."" The president's tweet came after a segment on Fox News Channel's Fox & Friends, in which conservative commentator Ben Shapiro argued viewers were turned off by Academy Award winners and presenters talking about diversity, gun violence and the #MeToo movement, which Shapiro called a ""lecture"" on morality.  ""That's highly irritating, I think, to most Americans, and it should be,"" Shapiro said. ""This is Hollywood patting itself on the back at the same time Hollywood is experiencing one of the greatest scandals that they've had in a century,"" he said, referring to the sexual harassment scandal that brought down Hollywood titans like Harvey Weinstein.  Trump was the subject of several jokes during the Oscars ceremony, and the president seemed delighted to suggest he was far more popular than the actors in this year's nominated films:  Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY. Problem is, we don’t have Stars anymore - except your President (just kidding, of course)! — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 6, 2018  On the numbers, Trump was correct. According to data released by Nielsen, the Academy Awards broadcast on ABC Sunday night did hit an all-time low of 26.5 million viewers, down significantly--20%--from one year ago, when the awards ceremony reached 33 million viewers.  But then there's Trump's even bolder claim: that he's the only ""Star"" anymore ""(just kidding of course)."" Of course? Trump's not kidding. He has repeatedly made claims to being the most powerful ratings force since the dawn of television, most recently--though falsely--claiming that the 45.6 million viewers who watched his first State of the Union address in January was ""the highest number in history,"" which it most definitely was not.  And while the president loves to tease CNN about its third-place ratings of late, Trump has ignored MSNBC's rise. For the first week of March, MSNBC finished first among the advertiser-coveted demographic of viewers 25-54 in each hour from 9 p.m. to 3 a.m., with Rachel Maddow, who has focused extensively on the investigation into Russian collusion with the Trump campaign, finishing the week as the top-rated show in cable news.  Maddow, however, is not likely to fit the bill when the president talks about big ratings and ""Stars.""  Hollywood observers note that the nominees this year did not include many hit movies and that viewership has been down for most of TV's big draws, including the Super Bowl, the Golden Globes and the Grammys. The Oscars had their last big year in 2014 when 43.7 million people tuned in to watch host Ellen DeGeneres take a selfie with Meryl Streep, Brad Pitt, and other stars that was retweeted more than 3 million times and is one of the most-retweeted messages ever.  Trump, by the way, does not appear on the list of 30 most-retweeted tweets on Twitter, but Barack Obama does, with four of the top 30, and Hillary Clinton has two--including her ""delete your account"" retweet of one of Trump's own campaign tweets from 2016, making fun of Obama for endorsing Clinton."	1
"There's nothing better than fans freaking out when they meet a celebrity -- except for fans freaking out double-time when they meet two celebrities!  Miley Cyrus joined Jimmy Fallon for night two of the Tonight Show's ""Miley Week"" on Tuesday, and the hilarious pair decided to surprise the daylights out of some unsuspecting tourists.  Fallon and Cyrus opted to photobomb fans as they snapped pictures in one of the spinning chairs from The Voice -- which makes sense considering the Younger Now artist's role as a coach on the show this season.  Armed with an array of props, they posed in increasingly goofy positions behind the chair -- including eating a sandwich from both ends a la Lady and the Tramp.  NEWS: Miley Cyrus Sings Pop Cover of Cardi B's 'Bodak Yellow,' And It's Kind of Amazing  But the real in the adorable segment joy came when they finally revealed themselves to the fans, leading to some truly epic meltdowns of excitement.  The best moments were when fans would notice Fallon first and lose their minds, only to then realize Cyrus was there too!  NEWS: Miley Cyrus Shows Off Her Dance Moves in 'Ew!' Sketch With Jimmy Fallon  The laughter-filled prank was a fun, feel-good segment to celebrate ""Miley Week,"" a noticeable contrast to the singer's appearance on Monday's episode, where she opened the show with a powerful rendition of Dido's ""No Freedom.""  The 24-year-old pop star was joined by Adam Sandler on guitar, and the pair dedicated the emotional performance to the victims of the Las Vegas shooting on Sunday.  WATCH: Chris Pratt and Chris Evans Photobomb Unsuspecting Super Bowl Fans, Hilarity Ensues  However, this isn’t the first time Cyrus and Fallon have surprised random people for a bit on the late night talk show. Back in June, the pair went undercover, in full disguise, as street musicians in a New York City subway station.  While the pair were somewhat unrecognizable, Cyrus' flawless soulful cover of Dolly Parton's ""Jolene"" attracted a lot of attention and soon the pair revealed themselves.

Pitch Perfect 2. Photo: Universal Pictures  The trailer for the third and final (I’ll believe when I see it) installment in the Pitch Perfect franchise has finally arrived — and with it, immense waves of Pitch Perfect nostalgia. (Isn’t it wonderful to be alive at a time when a “Pitch Perfect franchise” is a real thing?) According to that new trailer, Pitch Perfect 3 promises more of what we’ve all come to expect from the Pitch Perfect movies: organized nerd singing, mash-ups of songs we didn’t know we needed but now can’t live without (hello “Wake Me Up” and “Zombie”), and, of course, the inexplicable but always adorable use of “aca” as a prefix. In honor of this beloved aca-tradition, Vulture has gone ahead and made a list of all the plays on “aca” and “pitch” in the franchise thus far. No, this is not a joke. We’re Dixie Chick serious.  Pitch Perfect  The seminal movie about college students making sweet, sweet music with their mouths, and the bonds of sisterhood overcoming any obstacle — even when that obstacle is a gorgeous solo from Ben Platt. The original Pitch Perfect introduces us to the world of competitive collegiate a cappella singing through Anna Kendrick’s Beca, a freshman who pretty much hates everything and is honestly, a real bitch, until she meets the Barden Bellas and learns that singing covers and having a solid group of lady friends is good for the soul. She also learns — thanks to Anna Camp’s Aubrey — that a cappella is very serious, and to show that seriousness, a person should use “aca” as a prefix or “pitch” in a punny way whenever possible.  “Aca-scuse me?”  There’s nothing like the first time, is there? This is aca-enthusiast Aubrey to Beca after Beca makes fun of a cappella during the Activities Fair. It is laced with as much attitude as you imagine.  “My fellow aca-people, we will not let egotistical, big-headed garbage dirtballs — whoever you may be — get in our way. I promise you we will return to the ICCAs and finish what we started last year.”  It’s time to be honest, pitches: Aubrey is the best character in the Pitch Perfect franchise and she never gets the recognition she deserves. Don’t aca-at me.  “Well, well, well, look who’s in treble!”  This isn’t “aca” or “pitch” related, but of all the puns the Treblemakers get out of their group name, this one, used on initiation night, is the best. It’s worth it for Adam Devine’s line reading alone. Bumper is the worst, but also kind of the best, right?  “Ladies, welcome to aca-initiation night.”  Aubrey has things to do and covers of songs to arrange, she cannot waste the syllables on “a cappella initiation night.” This usage is simply about brevity.  “You’re one of those a cappella girls. I’m one of those a cappella boys. And we’re gonna have aca-children. It’s inevitable.”  Slow your roll, Jesse! The way to any college girl’s heart is not to immediately talk about having children, aca or not.  “Hands in aca-bitches!”  Aubrey to the Bellas for their first group huddle. “Aca” is a very versatile prefix, used here as a term of endearment.  “I know you have a toner for Jesse.”  Ah, yes, the moment in which we all learned that “toner” is the term for a “musical boner,” and also learned that “musical boner” is a thing, I guess. Never tell me Pitch Perfect isn’t educational.  “I think we’re gonna be aca-awesome.”  Chloe is the yin to Aubrey’s yang, and when Aubrey is freaking out about how unprepared the Bellas are for their gig at the Sigma Beta Theta Fall Mixer, Chloe knows to talk her friend off the ledge via use of her favorite prefix. Of course, they go on to bomb the Sigma Beta Theta Fall Mixer, but that is neither here nor there. Also, them being so bad gives us one of the greatest lines in the movie: “This makes my beer taste bad.”  “Aca-scuse me?”  Yup, it’s your girl Aubrey, back with her standard reply to anyone who threatens her a cappella way of life. This time, it’s after Chloe suggests that Beca may be onto something when she complains abou	1
    surprised everyone at the American Music Awards. When Mark Cuban announced that they had won the AMA for Favorite Alternative Rock Artist on Sunday, November 19, he thought that they weren’t in attendance — until they made their way to the stage.  “They didn’t know we were gonna be here you guys … but we’re here,” Linkin Park cofounder Mike Shinoda said while accepting the award, thanking nominees Imagine Dragons and twenty one pilots. He then added that members of both bands had reached out following the death of their lead singer, Chester Bennington. Bennington, who was open about his battle with depression, committed suicide on July 20.  “We want to dedicate this award to him, to his memory, to his talent, to his sense of humor, to his joy,” Shinoda, 40, said alongside Brad Delson and Rob Bourdon. “Whether you’re a fan or an artist, take a moment to appreciate what you’ve got and make Chester proud.”  Following his passing, the band posted a heartfelt message on their website. “Our hearts are broken. The shockwaves of grief and denial are still sweeping through our family as we come to grips with what has happened,” they wrote, addressing a letter to Chester. “You touched so many lives, maybe even more than you realized.”  If you or anyone you know is experiencing suicidal thoughts, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 to be connected to a local crisis center for confidential emotional support.	1
"Glenn Martin Christopher Francis Quinn (May 28, 1970 – December 3, 2002) was an Irish actor. While he was best known for his portrayal of Mark Healy on the popular '90s family sitcom Roseanne, Quinn also amassed a large fan base for his portrayal of Doyle, a half-demon, on Angel, a spin-off series of Buffy the Vampire Slayer.[1][2]  Early life [ edit ]  Quinn was born in Dublin, Ireland on May 28, 1970, the son of Murty Quinn, a musician and singer with the Miami Showband who enjoyed seven #1 hits in the '60s and '70s, and his wife, Bernadette Quinn (nee Brady).[3] He was raised in Cabinteely, a suburb of Dublin, and attended Clonkeen College.[1][4] He emigrated from Ireland to the United States with his mother and two sisters, Sonja and Louisa, in 1988, when he was still just a teenager, with the family settling in Los Angeles, California.[4] Quinn had a third sibling, a brother Ciaran, whom he never knew existed as the boy had been placed for adoption.[5]  Career [ edit ]  Quinn did commercials for Pepsi and Ray-Ban, appeared in the music video for the Richard Marx song ""Satisfied,"" and had his first speaking line in the pilot of Beverly Hills, 90210 after having endured eight separate auditions for the role of ""Brandon Walsh"" and then ""Steve Sanders""[6] (played by Jason Priestley and Ian Ziering, respectively). Casting director Johanna Ray gave him a small role with two lines in the pilot, but Quinn was barely visible in the final broadcast version.  In 1991, Quinn had his first major role in the movie Shout, which starred John Travolta and in which Quinn shared an on-screen kiss with Gwyneth Paltrow in her debut film.[7]  One of Quinn's more visible roles began in 1990 as the character Mark Healy, Becky Conner's boyfriend and later husband, in Roseanne. He continued in this role until the show ended in 1997 (seasons 3–9). In 2018, the fourth episode of the revived show's tenth season was dedicated to the memory of Quinn.  Quinn took on the role as youngest son Cedric on the 1992 U.S. and UK TV series Covington Cross.  In 1992, he starred alongside Holly Marie Combs in Dr. Giggles.[2] In 1997, he played dual roles in the horror anthology film Campfire Tales.  After seven years using an American accent on Roseanne, Quinn was pleased producers made Doyle on Angel Irish because it would allow him to use his native accent. In an interview with The Irish Times, Quinn said of his accent, ""I've been hiding it for so long that it's amazing to have some freedom. It was like putting on an old pair of shoes. It's bringing my soul back to life.""[1] His last film work was in R.S.V.P. (2002).  Death [ edit ]  On December 3, 2002, Quinn's body was found at a friend's home in North Hollywood, California.[8] An autopsy found that Quinn had died as the result of a heroin overdose.[9] In the months leading up to his death, Quinn had reportedly been struggling with homelessness and drug addiction. His issues with substance abuse started in 1987. Unable to maintain sobriety, he was eventually bought out as owner of Goldfingers nightclub in Los Angeles, California. [10][1][11][12] Quinn neither married nor had any children.

"Sarah Jessica Parker wore an elaborate hat to the Met Gala this year.  It turns out, the headpiece was a depiction of the Nativity scene.  It perfectly aligned with the event's theme, which was ""Heavenly Bodies: Fashion & The Catholic Imagination.""  Parker previously said that she is a ""stickler"" for dressing in-theme.    After sitting out last year's Met Gala, Sarah Jessica Parker returned to the event on Monday night — and she brought her A-game.  The actor, who previously said she's a ""stickler"" when it comes to dressing to the theme, made good on her word and arrived in an outfit that perfectly aligned with this year's ""Heavenly Bodies: Fashion & The Catholic Imagination"" exhibit.  Parker wore a ruffled gold and silver gown with a dramatic train. She topped off her ensemble with loads of blue eyeshadow and a flower tucked behind her ear. But the one thing that really stole the show was her combination headband and hat, which was actually a depiction of the Nativity scene.  You probably missed that Nativity scene. Neilson Barnard / Getty  Truly a look. Neilson Barnard/Getty Images  People think the Nativity scene really took her look to the next level.  In this case, it looks like being a stickler paid off.

"It's the end of Libra season, and that means it's time for one of the biggest reality-television stars to celebrate her birthday. On Sunday, Kim Kardashian received birthday messages from her family on social media, and their wishes show that this family is still so close. On Instagram, both Khloé Kardashian and Kendall Jenner took the time to post a message for Kim, who celebrated her 38th birthday on October 21. Meanwhile, Kylie Jenner shared her bday message to her big sister via an Instagram Story, while their mom penned a beautiful ode to her daughter.  The family was sure to share the love online with throwback pictures and special messages. Khloé shared a slideshow of photos with Kim, and included a long message for her sister about how she continues to be impressed by her. The Good American founder wrote:  Happy birthday sweet Kimberly!!! My entire life, you've always been someone that I look up to. To me, You are super woman!! I'm not sure how you do it all and make everything look so easy. People have no idea how selfless of a human being you are. With no credit wanted either.  Her message went on to acknowledge how much the sisters have been through over the years, and how they are lucky to be able to be there for each other, even when their lives take unexpected turns. Khloé continued:  I am so impressed by the woman, wife and mother you have become. I'm so thankful for us getting closer over the last year. You're a f****** rider! Without you I would be lost! Crazy sh*t happens to us all of the time, but how f****** lucky are we that we get to experience this crazy thing called life with one another? I know for certain, that no matter what happens to any of us, we will always be OK because we have one another. I hope you have the happiest of birthdays Keeks! I pray that every wish you have, it comes true. You are so deserving! I love you!! Until the end of time, I love you!!!  The sweet message definitely seems to allude to how motherhood has brought Khloé and Kim closer since the birth of little True earlier this year.  Of course, Khloé wasn't the only family member to send Kim a happy birthday message. Kylie shared a video from the Kim X Kylie makeup collaboration to her Instagram Story, captioning the photo: ""HAPPY BIRTHDAY KIMMY I LOVE YOU"" with a party hat emoji.  Kris Jenner also shared a collage of photos on Instagram, and included a note about the special day as well. She wrote:  ""Happy birthday Kim Kardashian!!! My beautiful girl, I love and adore you and wish for you the most amazing day and year...you have brought all of us such love, joy, and happiness. You are the best mom, wife, sister, daughter and friend and i am beyond blessed to be your Mom.""  On her Instagram Story, Kris also shared a preview for a Keeping Up With the Kardashians birthday marathon.  Finally, Kendall honored her big sister by sharing clips from Kanye West's iconic (and super nostalgic) birthday video that he made for his wife in 2016. Kendall captioned her post with, ""happy birthday to my beautiful sister @kimkardashian.""  West was all about spreading the birthday love this year too. He shared his surprise gift for Kim — stunning flowers — on social media. The Kardashian-West family is known for pulling out all the stops when it comes to presents. In August, West surprised Kim with a lime green Mercedes SUV she'd fallen in love with driving while on vacation. It must have been difficult to pick yet another meaningful gift, but he managed to pick the perfect thing. Instead of buying a normal bouquet of flowers, West decked their home out with unique floral arrangements that hung from the ceiling.  There was more to the birthday present: West also had a pianist waiting to play music when she woke up. On Twitter, he shared a video of the scene, writing:  ""You’re stunning. I will keep trying to make things that can express how beautiful you are inside and out and how much I love you and our family.""  Kim loved the present, and she sha"	1
"Usher responds to herpes lawsuit, denies he exposed plaintiffs to STD  Usher has responded for the first time to accusations he exposed sex partners to genital herpes, filing a legal document containing a broad denial without actually specifying whether he has or had the sexually transmitted disease.  Usher's lawyers on Tuesday filed an answer to a lawsuit brought last month in Los Angeles Superior Court by Quantasia Sharpton and an unnamed man and unnamed woman who claim to have been Usher's sexual partners.  Usher is seeking to have their lawsuit dismissed, citing a ""general denial"" of its allegations and 13 more specific reasons why he claims the suit has no merit.  His reasons include legal technicalities, such as the statute of limitations, lack of standing by plaintiffs, the improper joining of plaintiffs in one suit, insufficient facts, and failure to meet legal standards.  But the singer also argues that any of his alleged conduct was ""unintentional,"" and that the plaintiffs themselves have ""unclean hands."" That's a legal doctrine meaning a plaintiff is not entitled to a remedy because the plaintiff has acted unethically or in bad faith in some way.  ""Plaintiffs are barred from recovery for alleged willful conduct by Defendant because any alleged conduct by Defendant, which is expressly denied, was unintentional,"" the singer's response says.  Usher asserted that he ""was not the cause of any alleged harm"" suffered by the plaintiffs and that the plaintiffs ""assumed the risk"" of any alleged harm.  The lawsuit should be dismissed, Usher argues, ""because any harm that any plaintiff alleges to have suffered was caused in whole or in part by that plaintiff's own negligence."" He does not specify the nature of the alleged negligence.  Usher's four-page response to the Sharpton lawsuit is his first official statement about the case since Sharpton and her lawyer, Lisa Bloom, announced their pursuit of the singer (full name Usher Raymond IV) for allegedly not disclosing an STD diagnosis prior to sexual contact.  California law says that individuals who know they have an STD are guilty of a misdemeanor if they do not disclose their status to partners before engaging in sexual acts.  At a press conference last month, Sharpton said she does not have herpes. But she claimed there are ""others"" who do but are too embarrassed to say so publicly.  ""I am doing this so that he does not do this to anyone else,"" she said, urging the singer to reveal his status. ""Usher, if you are negative, please say so. If you are positive, you need to warn your sex partners, so that they can make their own informed decisions.”  The Sharpton lawsuit, which does not specify how much the plaintifs are seeking in damages, asserts that Usher contracted herpes before his encounters with the plaintiffs. Bloom said those happened after 2012.  Bloom called Usher's response to the lawsuit ""a standard legal answer. We look forward to taking Usher's deposition soon and to proving our case in court,"" she told USA TODAY.  Usher's publicist has not yet responded to USA TODAY's request for comment."	1

Bonnie and Clyde pair get second chance after announcing La La Land instead of Moonlight at the 2017 Academy Awards  At the 90th Academy Awards on Sunday, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway are getting a mulligan: the Bonnie and Clyde pair will present the Oscar for best picture again, one year after they infamously announced La La Land, instead of the actual winner, Moonlight.  After Weinstein: why this year’s Oscars are make or break Read more  Last year Beatty and Dunaway presented the night’s top honor to mark the 50th anniversary of Bonnie and Clyde. When Beatty hesitated to announce the winner, visibly confused by the contents on the card, Dunaway read off La La Land as best picture. The mistake was attributed to the accountants at PricewaterhouseCoopers, who mixed up the envelope for best actress, won by La La Land’s Emma Stone, with that of best picture.  For several minutes the mistake went unaccounted for, as the cast of La La Land gave speeches on the stage. Then, producer Jordan Horowitz corrected the record, telling the the audience there had been a mistake and that Moonlight had won the award.  This year, the Academy has streamlined its processes to prevent another mistake. But Beatty and Dunaway, evidently, will get a second chance to announce the prestigious award. On Thursday evening, TMZ learned that the two were spotted rehearsing at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, where Dunaway said “presenting is better the second time around”. Beatty replied: “The winner is Gone with the Wind.”  Other confirmed presenters during this year’s telecast include Sandra Bullock, Lupita Nyong’o, Emily Blunt, Armie Hammer, Tiffany Haddish, Jodie Foster and Gal Gadot, while the ceremony will again be hosted by Jimmy Kimmel. Guillermo del Toro’s 60s-set romantic fantasy The Shape of Water leads the way with 13 nominations.	1

    Twice the fun! Kym Johnson and Robert Herjavec were thrown a lavish baby shower on Saturday, March 31, where they also revealed the gender of their twins!  The Shark Tank star, 55, and Johnson shared the exciting news — that they are expecting a baby boy and a baby girl — by popping two big black balloons that held smaller pink and blue balloons and confetti. The sweet moment was captured by one of their guests, BP Major, who wrote, “Genders are revealed!!!! So excited. Congratulations to @robert_herjavec and @kymherjavec5678 – love you both” with dancing man emojis. Other guests in attendance included the Dancing With the Stars alum’s friends and costars, Cheryl Burke and Anna Trebunskaya.  The host of the party, Carson Kressley, shared a sweet photo with Johnson that he hilariously captioned, “One of us is pregnant!” The Queer Eye for the Straight Guy alum, who was once a contestant on DWTS, decorated the party with pretty displays of pink and blue hydrangeas. Guests were treated to an impressive layout of pastries that were also surrounded by blue and pink details.  As previously reported, Johnson and Herjavec, who met when they were paired together on season 20 of the ABC series and married in 2016, announced they were expecting in December 2017. Throughout her pregnancy, the professional dancer, 41, has been documenting her journey by sharing photos of her baby bump on her social media accounts.  This was not the only party thrown in honor of the couple. In January, Herjavec threw his wife a baby shower in her native Australia, where she celebrated with family and friends.	1

Happy birthday @instasuelos you put the D in #daddy Loved by all, especially me! ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️  A post shared by Kelly Ripa (@kellyripa) on Mar 30, 2018 at 6:41am PDT	1
A year into his three-year relationship with his boyfriend Kyle, Will Ontiveros, 27, became what he calls “happy fat” — packing on pounds through a combination of nights out and vacations together, as well as a comfort level with his partner that left him feeling like he didn’t have to watch his weight.  The TV and film producer added about 40 pounds onto his stocky, 5-foot-11 frame, but his boyfriend, who is 6-foot-5, didn’t. When Kyle ended their relationship in December 2015, he cited Ontiveros’ bigger figure as one of the reasons, saying he was no longer attracted to him.  “He had mentioned the weight gain a year before he broke up with me, and I wasn’t able to do anything about it or didn’t have motivation,” Ontiveros tells The Post. “[The criticism] was sporadic . . . It would come up when we were frustrated with each other.”  Ontiveros, who moved from New Mexico to LA to be with Kyle, decided to win back his ex by signing up for the new E! weight-loss reality TV show “Revenge Body With Khloé Kardashian.” In 12 weeks, he lost 30 pounds from a starting weight of 255 pounds.  In the eight-episode series, which premieres Thursday at 8 p.m., LA-based participants spend three months working out with a personal trainer to lose weight, motivated by a desire to prove themselves to someone in their life, such as an ex or a parent. Boldface trainers include Gunnar Peterson, Harley Pasternak, Simone De La Rue and others.  Along the way, participants receive encouragement and tough love from Khloé, who has struggled with her weight since being dubbed the “fat sister” of the famous Kardashian clan.  Contestant Ranella Ferrer, a 5-foot-4 vocalist, turned to food to deal with a breakup and a mother who wasn’t supportive of her music ambitions. The 28-year-old’s 70-pound weight gain affected her career, as she began to bail on singing gigs because she was too ashamed to perform onstage at 207 pounds. Her mother became even more critical of her weight, career and lack of a boyfriend.  “I wanted to get revenge on my mom. And I wanted to make her proud, because I feel like out of every one of the [five] children, I was the one that was the outcast,” she says. “Everyone’s a professional or college student . . . and here I am, a struggling artist who’s overweight and single with no kids.”  Trainers worked with each participant on an individualized diet and exercise plan. Ferrer had to change her Thai food-heavy diet by limiting rice in meals, ordering more salads and drinking a gallon of water a day. Ontiveros started hitting the gym up to six times a week with Peterson, lifting weights and doing total-body resistance workouts, as well as an hour of cardio every night.  Due to its title, “Revenge Body” has stirred up some pre-premiere controversy from health experts and viewers who worry it will promote quick-fix workouts and the body-shaming idea that you have to be thin and toned to be happy. Trainer Peterson says that while revenge can be an effective motivator, weight-loss success depends on much more than that, which the participants discover on the show.  “Like many of the flawed fitness programs out there, if revenge is what it takes you to get up and get going, I’m all for it,” says Peterson, who has trained Khloé, along with her mom, Kris, and sister Kim. “I would say — and I think this happened on Will’s journey — he grew so much past that.  When you’re doing this for you, it’s way more efficient. [Now] he goes home to visit his mom and he’s going to the gym on his own every day. That’s a big move for somebody who wasn’t going [at all].”  If revenge is what it takes you to get up and get going, I’m all for it.  The show is also a culmination of Khloé’s own weight-loss journey, which began in 2013. The 32-year-old reality TV star has since lost 40 pounds, with some worrying she’s gone too far. Peterson attributes Khloé’s success to her work ethic.  “When Khloé trains with me, she shows up early, she knocks out cardio, she stretches 	1

"At last, the content we both deserve and need. Thursday, December 14, 2017, shall henceforth be known as the day that Will Smith, famous actor, father of Jaden and Willow , husband of Jada, finally made an Instagram . And he's a natural, as it turns out. Since posting the inaugural photo (a duck-face selfie, naturally) a day ago, the actor has amassed more than a million followers, gotten verified, and posted seven photos. In terms of social media savvy, Will Smith is a veritable Selena Gomez .  But along the way, Smith got some advice from a couple of famous friends. The first, Ellen DeGeneres, queen of the celebrity selfie, gave Smith a comprehensive Instagram tutorial during her show on Thursday. After the actor announced he's ""finally going on Instagram,"" DeGeneres helped him take a series of trendy portraits for the 'gram. They ran through duck-lips, a mirror selfie, a photo with a baby as a prop, a photo with vegetables as a prop, and a #TBT, all of which has since been uploaded onto Smith's Instagram. The most popular is, of course, the #TBT, a photo of Smith and DeGeneres recreating a still from the Fresh Prince of Bel-air opening credits that's gotten more than 366,000 likes.  Loading View on Instagram  Shortly after, Justin Timberlake became the first famous person to welcome Smith to Instagram. He posted a #TBT as well, along with some dad-friendly instructions.  Loading View on Instagram  ""Welcome to Instagram @willsmith,"" he wrote in the caption. ""This is called a #TBT. Which means Throwback Thursday. Which is a photo you post on Thursdays that you like, that was taken in the past. I like this photo because it’s a photo of you and me. And we look like we are having a serious conversation about something very important. And that makes me feel important.""  Smith, however, is doing just fine on his own. He has posted his own #TBT, a vintage photo of the actor as a young baby. ""Ya’ll ain’t got no filters like this,"" he wrote in the caption. All hail the Fresh Prince of Instagram."	1
"The former Miss America and news anchor who settled her sexual harassment lawsuit against then-Fox News chief Roger Ailes for $20 million will head the organization's board of directors amid a recent email scandal where the now-former CEO used crude language to discuss former pageant winners.  Former Miss America (1989) and Fox & Friends co-host Gretchen Carlson — who settled a sexual harassment lawsuit against then-Fox News CEO Roger Ailes for $20 million — will now serve as chair of the Miss America Organization board of directors, the organization announced Monday. Huffington Post was the first to report Carlson's new position.  Carlson is joining the organization amid a recent controversy of leaked internal emails from Miss America leaders, including now-former CEO Sam Haskell, which crudely discussed the appearances of women who had competed in the pageant with demeaning and misogynistic language. Carlson confirmed Huffington Post's report of her new position and tweeted, ""Honored to move this iconic program forward with so many amazing volunteers.""  “Everyone has been stunned by the events of the last several days, and this has not been easy for anyone who loves this program. In the end, we all want a strong, relevant Miss America and we appreciate the existing board taking the steps necessary to quickly begin stabilizing the organization for the future,” said Carlson in a statement from the Miss America Organization.  The Miss America Organization also announced former Miss Americas Laura Kaeppeler Fleiss (Miss America 2012), Heather French Henry (Miss America 200) and Kate Shindle (Miss America 1998) are joining the board. The group recently told the Associated Press they were seeking the help of former Miss Americas and state directors to recommend the next generation of leaders for the pageant.  A statement from the group also noted that that Carlson will ""work with all Miss America stakeholders, including the organization’s state executive directors and former state titleholders, to continue an ongoing inclusive and transparent process to identify additional new board members and management.""  After Haskell’s resignation last week, president and COO Josh Randle and chairman Lynn Weidner also resigned after being revealed to have also exchanged the demeaning emails among the board members."	1

"The couple has been dating for 31 years.  Oprah Winfrey and longtime partner Stedman Graham have been going steady for 31 years, but don't expect any wedding bells soon. Or ever.  The media mogul revealed in an interview with Vogue that not getting married has taught her to ""live life on your own terms,"" she said. Despite having dated for so long, Winfrey shared that the duo have only discussed marriage once. ""The only time I brought it up was when I said to Stedman, 'What would have happened if we had actually gotten married?' And the answer is: 'We wouldn’t be together.' ""  She continued to explain that ""marriage requires a different way of being in this world."" The talk show host added that she wouldn't have fit into what she viewed as a ""traditional"" role.  Last year, it was rumored that Winfrey and Graham said ""I do."" However, Winfrey took to Twitter to set the record straight.  6 people who know me well have called today congratulating me or surprised they weren't invited to my wedding.  IT' s NOT TRUE!! — Oprah Winfrey (@Oprah) September 5, 2016  According to Today, there was a time when Winfrey wanted her other half to marry her.  ""I wanted Stedman to want to marry me. The moment he asked me to marry him I was, like... 'Now I actually have to get married?' "" she revealed to Shonda Rhimes in a 2015 episode of SuperSoul Sunday. Graham proposed more than 20 years ago and the wedding was supposed to take place in 1993, but Winfrey was working on a book at the same time, so they decided to postpone it. ""We have never discussed it again,"" she told Rhimes."	0

For quite some time I have kept my patience with the news of Ben Affleck leaving DCFU. I wrote a fan-fic about how they can do it with the Flashpoint movie, but nowhere did I confirm it. After Variety came out with news about the reconstruction of executive roles behind the screen of DCFU and so-called confirmation of Affleck leaving the role, fans have been speculating who should wear the cowl next. Now, the news of Ben wanting to leave Batman’s role isn’t new and many actors names to replace him have surfaced time and again. But a few days ago I saw an article from one of the popular websites that claimed that Jon Hamm wants to steal Ben Affleck’s Batman role.  It stated that –  Jon’s gunning hard for the role. They’ve (Ben and Jon) enjoyed working together and have been on good terms ever since. But Jon knows Ben has faced some criticism over Batman v Superman and Justice League and frankly thinks he’d be better suited for the job. This is business for Jon, not personal  And no matter how exciting it may sound to Hamm’s fans, according to me, the facts that I have gathered so far appear to confirm that it’s a big fat lie.  Jon doesn’t even want a Superhero role, leave aside Batman.  During an interview with The Radio Times in 2014, Hamm was asked whether he’d ever been offered a role in a superhero film. The actor stated that he’d been offered several, but made the “right decision” in turning them down. He didn’t disclose what these parts were but described these types of movie deals as “draconian.”  He specifically said –  For me to sign on now to do a superhero movie would mean I would be working until I am fifty as that particular superhero. It’s a lot of work at one thing, which is not necessarily the reason I got into the business – which is to do many things. If you want to spend all day pressing the same key that… seems an odd choice  Now it may seem old talk, but I don’t think that Jonn will change his mind and become so desperate for a superhero role. This just proves what a false argument those websites presented when they went for Jon Hamm becoming desperate for comic book character without having a glimpse of his past statements.  One rumour contradicts the other.  It’s so disheartening to know that people with power and sources today exploit the innocent. These news websites come out with new rumours every other day which are more bogus than the previous. A few days ago we got a rumour that Matt Reeves is looking for a younger actor to play Batman in his trilogy. And now we are getting another rumour that an actor who’s older than Affleck is being considered for the role. Obviously, both the rumours are contradicting one another implying that one of them is definitely false.  What are your thoughts on this? Do you think Jon, after stating that he doesn’t want to be a part of superhero franchise would ask for the Batman role? Tell us in the comments. Also if you find any such hoax on the internet, do share it with us on Twitter @DawnOfComics and we will dig into it for you.	0
"Last night, actor Brad Pitt made a surprise appearance at the Hollywood premiere of ""The Lost City Of Z,” which he executive-produced.  On the red carpet, Pitt appeared to be in good spirits while smiling for the cameras. He was also noticeably thinner. A source recently told Us Weekly, ""He lost a bunch of weight. He's focusing on himself again, watching what he eats, and has a chef making him healthy meals. He's exercising. He's been outdoors a lot, hiking and walking. He’s had a lot of time to focus on himself.”  Another insider shared with the publication, ""He does a lot of weight training. He’s dedicated to clean living and eating right.”  Getty  Brad has slowly been returning to the spotlight since his split with Angelina Jolie in September. Earlier this year, he made an unexpected showing at the Golden Globes, where he presented a segment about Best Picture winner “Moonlight,"" which was produced by his production company Plan B."	1
IT’S the role no actor wants — the one right before a huge celebrity break-up that inevitably leads to thousands of fans looking for someone to blame.  And, whether the rumours are real or false, it doesn’t stop the wrath of fans and tabloids alike speculating who or what led to the split.  Here’s the stars who unwittingly became collateral damage from celebrity break-ups — purely because of a role they took.  PASSENGERS  The world is still recovering from Chris Pratt and Anna Faris’ separation announcement this week and, like most celebrity break-ups, the search has been on for someone to blame.  Jennifer Lawrence unfortunately became that exact person after Faris responded to cheating rumours between her then-husband and the actress in 2015 after they starred together in Passengers.  “[That] stung a little bit harder than I thought it would,” Faris told Us Weekly in August, 2015.  “I had always kind of believed that part of the rumours of celebrity couples were sort of true because they had never been part of my life. I was like, ‘Oh, maybe there’s a kernel of truth to that.’ It’s been a little devastating because for us, it’s like, ‘What the heck?’” the then-38-year-old actress said.  “This has been blindsiding to us. We have an incredible relationship. It has been weirdly stinging,” she added.  ALLIED  Midway through the promotion tour for Brad Pitt and Marion Cotillard’s 2017 movie Allied, Pitt’s marriage to Angelina Jolie — one of the most high profile in Hollywood — abruptly came to an end.  The French actress was immediately in the firing line following Jolie’s decision to file for divorce — a rumour Cotillard quickly shut down.  “This is going to be my first and only reaction to the whirlwind news that broke 24 hours ago and that I was swept up into. I am not used to commenting on things like this nor taking them seriously but as this situation is spiralling and affecting people I love, I have to speak up,” she began.  The actress went on to slam the rumours she was “the other woman”, instead revealing she was pregnant with her and her partner’s second child.  “Firstly, many years ago, I met the man of my life, father of our son and of the baby we are expecting. He is my love, my best friend, the only one that I need. Secondly to those who have indicated that I am devastated, I am very well thank you.”  Cotillard has been with partner French actor and director Guillaume Canet since 2007 and he also came to her defence on Instagram, slamming the “venal stupidity” of the rumours and urged people to stop “constantly coming out with s**t”.  And while these two might be completely fake, there’s obviously precedent for the blaming, and here’s a few reasons why fans go into a frenzy if couples break up immediately after shooting a movie.  MR & MRS SMITH  If there’s one movie everyone knows as the one that ended a relationship, it’s Mr and Mrs Smith.  Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie’s on-screen chemistry seemed a little too realistic and Jennifer Aniston’s abrupt separation from Pitt the same year the movie was filmed seemed to confirm everyone’s suspicions.  Announcing their split in January 2005, the Hollywood golden couple finalised their divorce by October the same year. Three months later Jolie confirmed to PEOPLE she was pregnant with her and Pitt’s first child.  Pitt and Jolie have both confirmed they fell in love while making the 2005 movie with Jolie telling the New York Times, “not a lot of people get to see a movie where their parents fell in love”.  Sadly it’s all over now with Jolie filing for divorce in September 2016.  VANILLA SKY  When people used to think of Hollywood golden couples, the top of the list was always Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman.  But a month before filming wrapped on Cruise’s 2001 film Vanilla Sky, the actor filed for divorce from his wife, not long after they’d celebrated their 10 year wedding anniversary.  While the couple’s publicists eventually said the separation was mutual, blame fell on Cru	0
Is Barbie expecting a baby?! A new report claims that Nicki Minaj is pregnant and Nas is the father! Whoa!  Nicki Minaj isn’t a stranger to pregnancy rumors, but this new report by Media Takeout is claiming the “Anaconda” rapper is definitely expecting this time around! According to the site, “[Nicki] found out she was pregnant during Thanksgiving and supposedly she’s supposed to announce her bundle of joy around the Grammys.” They added that Nas, Nicki’s current beau, is the father, but pointed out that there may be trouble in paradise. While Nicki’s been quieter than usual on social media since breaking the internet with her Paper Magazine cover, she tweeted, “Have you ever noticed how confused people act when you start treating them EXACTLY how they’ve been treating you?” MTO’s report says this is a direct reference to Nas being stubborn and moody. Hmm! They also claim that Nas told his ex Kelis that he and Nicki were expecting, and “Kelis is jealous about not being Nas ONLY baby’s mother – so she’s messing with their custody arrangement.”  This report claiming Nicki is pregnant comes just a month and a half after she tweeted to her fans, “Y’all want the album or the baby? Cuz ch- y’all ain’t bout to get both.” Whoa. As previously noted, this isn’t the first time Nicki has been subject to pregnancy rumors. Last February, Nicki posted a photo of herself with a baby bump and sparked baby rumors, but it was only an edit by her fans that she reposted. Then, in July 2017, Nicki tweeted a baby emoji, which fans immediately took as an announcement. However, in 2015, when she was dating Meek Mill, Nicki shut down speculation concerning a pregnancy, writing, “No matter wut he, or anyone else says, Onika Tanya Maraj won’t b pushing anyone1 out her vajayjay, until she’s married. Now check that.” So, take that as you will, as it applies to her today!  HollywoodLife.com reached out to reps for Nicki & Nas and they have not responded.  HollywoodLifers, do you think Nicki is really pregnant?	0
"Kourtney Kardashian is taking her talents to Capitol Hill. On Monday, the eldest Kardashian sister touched down in Washington, D.C., where she reportedly addressed Congress to discuss reforms to outdated federal cosmetics regulations. According to TMZ, Kardashian has teamed up with the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit that does research and advocacy focused on corporate accountability and sustainable materials. The work trip is also reportedly being filmed for a future episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.  Kardashian documented her arrival in D.C. in an Instagram Story on Monday. The 39-year-old mom of three posted a video of her plane touching down, writing, ""Hi, Washington, D.C.,"" followed by a snap of a conference table spread with an EWG tote bag and cookbook, which she captioned, ""Meetings #beautymadebetter."" According to the EWG website, the #BeautyMadeBetter tag is part of a movement for cosmetics safety reform: ""Current laws leave the federal government powerless to screen personal care products for chemicals that have been linked to cancer, harm to the reproductive system in both men and women, and severe allergies, among other health effects,"" the site reads.  Kardashian is taking a stand in support of the Personal Care Products Safety Act, a bill that was introduced in 2015 by Senators Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) and Susan Collins (R-Maine). Not only would this bill set new health and safety standards for cosmetics and other personal care products, it would allow the Food & Drug Administration to regularly review the safety of various ingredients in these products, according to the EWG.  Kardashian has been outspoken in the past about her commitment to using only the safest, healthiest ingredients. Back when Kardashian Beauty products were available at the Kardashian sisters' DASH stores (R.I.P.) and other retailers, Kardashian stressed that her top priority was making sure these products were high-quality. ""Since we started putting together our makeup collection, Kardashian Beauty, I've been extra invested in our list of no-no ingredients. It's an ingredients blacklist that we don't allow into the products — no parabens, no sulfates,"" she told Into the Gloss in 2013. ""Being a mom, I have become really invested in that — I just feel like once I know something, I can't go backwards and pretend like I don't know it.""

She's paved her way as the matriarch of influencers.  And Kim Kardashian admitted she's being a little more careful with her words during an interview in New York with Kelly and Ryan, set to air on Friday morning.  The 37-year-old reality television star told the talk show hosts that she's rooting for sister Khloe and Tristan Thompson, after decrying Tristan's recent infidelity accusations as 'so f***ed up' on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.  Scroll down for video  Giving thought: Kim Kardashian admitted she's being a little more careful with her words during an interview in New York with Kelly and Ryan, set to air on Friday morning  When Ryan asked, 'Is there any part of you that roots for Khloe and Tristan,' Kim was quickly responded.  'Yeah, I mean ... ' she said as the audience could be heard chuckling in the background.  'OK, last time I went on TV and I answered some questions about her I got blocked on social media—and not from Khloe,' Kim said. 'So, I'm going to...yes, I'm always rooting for her. I'm always rooting for love.'  She went on to say that, 'I'm always rooting for families,' before Kelly quickly chimed in, 'As your attorney, that's a great answer!''  Talk about it: The 37-year-old reality television star told the talk show hosts that she's rooting for sister Khloe and Tristan Thompson, after decrying Tristan's recent infidelity accusations as 'so f***ed up' on The Ellen DeGeneres Show  Khloe recently gave birth to daughter True in April, just days after multiple cheating allegations against the Cleveland Caveliers basketball player surfaced.  While Khloe has stayed holed up at their Cleveland, Ohio home, Kim admitted that her little sister is reveling in being a new mom.  'Honestly, she's so focused on her baby. Her baby is gorgeous. Gorgeous!' the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star gushed. 'So, you know, she's so happy.'  During an April interview with Ellen, Kim admitted her feelings toward Khloe's situation as 'I don't even know how to describe it besides it's just so f***ed up.'  She went on to say that 'We really were rooting for Khloe and we still are,' before adding, 'You know she's so strong and she's doing the best that that she can.

'He's in Wyoming recording,' she said. 'He has a couple albums, so he's just focused on that. I will say, he gave me my first gray this week, and I am blaming that on him! But no, he's doing really good.'  After a series of tweets praising president Donald Trump, Kanye implied that slavery was a choice during an interview with TMZ before asking the room if they thought he was 'thinking free.'  'I actually don't think you're thinking anything,' TMZ's Van Lathan quickly cracked back at West, as many would in the ensuing hours.  Lathan said while West gets to live the elite artist's life, 'the rest of us in society have to deal with these threats in our lives. We have to deal with the marginalization that has come from the 400 years of slavery that you said for our people was our choice.'	1

"KIM Kardashian has broken her silence over claims she’s chosen the woman who will be a surrogate for her third child with Kanye West.  Yesterday it was reported the famous couple were in contact with “a married African-American college graduate with two children” who would help bring their third child into the world.  15 Kim Kardashian has broken her silence over reports she has chosen the woman she wants as her surrogate Credit: Splash News  But it seems Kim isn’t ready to discuss details yet, as she told E! News she would talk about her much-talked-about “third child” when she was ready.  Kim explained: “[There’s] so many details out there, and like I've never heard this, I've never heard this.  “Like whatever. We have not confirmed it, and that's that. I'll let you know when we're ready.  “I've definitely seen a lot of things, we've never confirmed anything.”  Kim made the comments during a night out with her sister Kendall Jenner at the Harper's BAZAAR event celebrating ICONS By Carine Roitfeld in New York.  Rumours surrounding Kim and Kanye deciding to expand their family have been circulating for months, after the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star said she would use a surrogate.  15 The reality star and her husband Kanye West have been at the centre of numerous surrogacy reports over the past few weeks Credit: Splash News  Earlier this week it was revealed that the couple, who are already parents to North, four, and Saint, one, will be welcoming a baby girl in January.  According to TMZ, the pair decided to have a third baby via surrogacy because of Kim's well-documented medical issues during her previous pregnancies.  15 According to recent claims, the pair are expecting their third baby in January 2018 Credit: Getty - Contributor  15 Kim was last seen in public out and about in LA on August 24 Credit: BackGrid  15 Kanye was seen leaving a recording studio in LA on Tuesday night Credit: X17Online.com  Another source told People: ""The entire family is over the moon.  ""Given her health scares in the past, Kim felt the need to hire a surrogacy agency that helped serve as the liaison in finding a healthy woman who would be a great surrogate option for her and Kanye.  ""Both of them have been super involved in the process.""  Neither Kim nor Kanye has confirmed the news but it's not the first time they've been at the centre of speculation a third child is on the way.  Reports of a surrogate surfaced in July, with Us Weekly claiming their chosen surrogate was already three months pregnant.  An insider alleged at the time that the woman was approached by the famous couple through “an agency”.  15 Kim and Kanye are already parents to daughter North, four, and son Saint, one, both conceived naturally Credit: Getty - Contributor  Claims of a surrogate child being on the way come after Kim revealed she suffers from a condition that means she is unable to carry any more children.  In an episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians aired last year, the reality star was warned she could ""bleed to death"" if she falls pregnant for a third time.  Kim sought her doctor's advice after admitting she wanted a third pregnant but fearing the same complications she endured in past pregnancies would return.  15 Kim, pictured in 2015 while pregnant with Saint, has been warned she could 'bleed to death' if she falls pregnant again Credit: Getty - Contributor  Doctor Crane warned her against it and said there is a ""potential fear"" for her after she suffered from toxaemia - toxins in the blood from infection - and had two ""very traumatic"" labours with North and Saint.  He said: ""Here's what I think, your pregnancies, you had toxaemia, you had a retained placenta, very traumatic, we're always worried about the next serious complication. I think the potential fear of the whole situation is legitimate.  ""You never know that you might not have the same type of problem that might be more serious this time. You're always taking a little bit of a chance. T"	1
Fuller House actress Jodie Sweetin has obtained a restraining order against her ex, Justin Hodak. Sweetin, 35, and Hodak, 40, just broke up after a year long engagement and Sweetin went on to get a restraining order. The court order required Hodak to stay 100 yards away from her, her job, her home, her children’s school and her vehicle. It also prohibited Hodak from contacting Sweetin in any way whether directly or indirectly.  Hodak arrested  The ex-fiancé clearly could not adhere to the restraining order and was arrested at Sweetin’s Sherman Oaks home in Carlifonia on Monday. It was merely days after the actress got the restraining order when Hodak showed up at her home. Sweetin called the police when she saw a suspicious vehicle outside her home and the cops swung in and arrested Hodak from his car. It was the second time he was arrested in a week as he was previously caught for unlawful possession of a firearm, as a convicted felon Hodak is not allowed to possess a rifle.  Raging arguments fractured their relationship  The two had a heated fight earlier on in the month that prompted Sweetin to call off the engagement. The fight, that estranged the two lovers, was escalated by Hodak’s rage. He was using testosterone supplements and steroids that were saidb to have fuelled his anger. The court documents had some revealing information stating that Hodak was abusing alcohol and marijuana on the said day. In the documents, Hodak supposedly threatened to commit suicide if Sweetin made him leave. Hodak left the house a while later armed with a 9mm pistol.  The court documents also state that Hodak had confessed to Sweetin about a drug problem and incarceration due to felony offences such as assault with a deadly weapon so as to support the habit. Hodak kept pestering the actress and made 87 phone calls just between the time of the break up and obtaining of the Emergency Protective Order. In addition to this, he also threatened to sell compromising photos of Sweetin which he keeps on his phone.  A narrative of abuse  In the documents, Jodie Sweetin also admits to abuse on various other altercations. The two lovers often had arguments where Hodak would throw things at Sweetin. At one time, during a previous break-up, Hodak followed Sweetin to Burbank at the Warner Bros. studios demanding to talk to her where he got into a push and shove with the security guards. In another incidence, Hodak waited for the actress outside her children’s school for a confrontation.  Jodie Sweetin stated, through her spokesperson, that she would appreciate privacy at this time. The scary situation has not been fully settled, however, Sweetin’s restraining order offers protection to people close to her including; her parents, daughters and assistant.	1
"ALEXANDRIA, Va. -- Leonardo DiCaprio joins the growing list of celebrities getting involved in helping Hurricane Harvey relief efforts. The Leonardo DiCaprio Foundation has donated $1 million to the newly established United Way Harvey Recovery Fund which will go toward short and long term relief and recovery efforts.  United Way Worldwide said Wednesday that the national fund will distribute 100 percent of donations to recovery efforts for those affected by Hurricane Harvey.  Thousands forced out of their homes due to flooding  ""We are incredibly grateful for the generosity of Leonardo DiCaprio and his foundation,"" said United Way Worldwide President and CEO Brian Gallagher in a statement. ""Responding to Hurricane Harvey requires the best of all of us - and that's what this gift represents.""  United Way is the world's largest privately-funded non-profit and anticipates Harvey recovery efforts will take several years.  The $1 million from DiCaprio's foundation represents the inaugural donation to the fund. It is the latest disaster relief support from the Oscar-winner's namesake foundation. DiCaprio and his foundation have previously donated to recovery efforts following the 2004 tsunami, the Haiti earthquake and Hurricane Sandy.  ""We hope others will step up and support the United Way and other organizations,"" foundation CEO Terry Tamminen said in the press release.  Many celebrities have pulled out their pocketbooks to help Harvey victims in recent days including Sandra Bullock, who on Tuesday donated $1 million to the American Red Cross.  Beyonce also pledged to do her part on Tuesday to help her hometown of Houston in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, and other stars, including Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and DJ Khaled, are also helping out by donating to the cause after Kevin Hart ""challenged"" them to do so. Johnson, Khaled and Hart each donated $25,000 to Harvey relief. Here's how you can help."	1
2018 Warner Bros Entertainment  “Mark Consuelos is such a nice guy,” swears executive producer Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa, who saw a video of the soap vet boldly defending wife Kelly Ripa from the paparazzi and thought, “That’s our Hiram Lodge.” Here, Consuelos’s onscreen wife, Marisol Nichols (as the equally conniving Hermione Lodge), gets a touch-up on the couple’s penthouse set, which, like most of the town’s hot spots, “we try to make look a bit noir,” Aguirre-Sacasa says. That’s a bonus for the show’s stylists: “They don’t have to tone down the makeup or costumes in those scenes,” adds the exec producer.	1
Stranger Things star Charlie Heaton was denied entry to the U.S. for alleged cocaine possession.  The 23-year-old British actor, who plays Jonathan Byers on the hit Netflix show, was detained at Los Angeles International Airport on October 21, People.com reports.  A law enforcement official confirmed to the website that Heaton was denied entry into the United States and sent back to the United Kingdom the same day. Authorities allegedly found cocaine on the actor, and he was detained but not arrested. It was reported that a random baggage check uncovered trace amounts of the class A drug in his bag.  Editors at The Sun newspaper claim the actor was caught by sniffer dogs at the airport, and border officials later found traces of white powder on his personal items.  Heaton was flying into the U.S. ahead of Netflix’s premiere party for Stranger Things second season, and the actor was noticeably absent on Thursday as his co-stars Millie Bobby Brown, Winona Ryder, Gaten Matarazzo and Noah Schnapp posed for pictures on the red carpet.  His brush with the law may also cast doubt on any future filming commitments for Stranger Things, as it is feared he may be banned from entering the U.S. in future.  A statement obtained by People from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection says any “foreign national may be inadmissible due to the commission of a crime involving drug possession.”  “A violation, conspiracy to violate or simply an attempt to violate any U.S. State, federal or any foreign government controlled substance violation renders a foreign national inadmissible to the United States,” it reads.  A rep for Heaton has yet to comment on the reports.  The second season of Stranger Things premiered on Netflix on Friday.	1
This week, Andy Dick was arrested and charged with sexual battery in Los Angeles for allegedly touching and making inappropriate comments to a woman passing him on the sidewalk. And now, a video of the comedian rubbing Ivanka Trump’s legs on television in 2007 has resurfaced. In the clip, both Dick and Trump are appearing as guests on Jimmy Kimmel Live! when suddenly Dick makes a comment about Ivanka’s legs and rubs them. Trump appears shocked but attempts to laugh off the incident while slapping Dick’s hand away. People reports that later Kimmel and a member of his security team removed Dick from the set.  Dick actually brought attention to the incident himself in an Instagram post last year when he posted a screenshot of the incident along with the caption, “The time I ‘groped’ Trump’s daughter, Ivanka, on Jimmy Kimmel Live. Her legs were sparkling, and I was trying to see if the glitter would wipe off. I also mistakenly thought she would date me. I was jokingly carried off by security. Is anybody going to carry Trump off? No joke. Confusing times.”  The Instagram post was written months after Dick was fired from two films following allegations of sexual assault and harassment.	1

Schumer and Hanisch are splitting after a year and a half of dating, the actress' rep confirmed on Tuesday in statements to US Weekly and E! News.  “Amy and Ben have ended their relationship after thoughtful consideration and remain friends,” Schumer’s rep said.  From the looks of her Instagram, Schumer is keeping busy in the aftermath of her breakup: participating in table reads, singing karaoke and making press appearances with her Snatched on-screen mom, Goldie Hawn.  Schumer and Hanisch made frequent appearances together on red carpets and ballpark kiss cams, celebrating their one-year anniversary in November with dueling Instagram posts.    ""A year ago I met the love of my life,"" Hanisch captioned a black-and-white picture. ""We both weren't looking for a relationship at the time, but something felt right from the very first night we met. We ended up spending 6 days in a row together. This pic was taken in New Orleans and was the night I knew I wanted to spend my life with her.""    Meanwhile, Schumer opted for a more humorous approach. ""A year ago today I met the love of my life. Happy anniversary (expletive),"" she joked in her post."	1

When it took them FOUR MINUTES to work out a fan's name to sing 'Happy Birthday' to them  This endearing EPIC FAIL happened when the boys couldn't work out the little girl's name, then decided to call her Trevor but the poor kid looked so upset they even got her to try and spell it out in the air. Hazza was so happy when they finally worked out she was called Lexie, he literally threw himself on the floor.  2. Harry giving his advice to one fan trying to get pregnant...  Harry talking about a woman in the crowd who's trying to get pregnant pic.twitter.com/XgCkJwpIKS — best harry pics (@thestylespics) September 4, 2015  Because who doesn't want Harry Styles' advice when it comes to conceiving?!  3. ""How do you find Will Smith in the snow? Look for the fresh PRINTS""... Harry brought the LOLZ every night!  You can tell Harry was waiting ALL night to tell that one.  4. Comedy isn't Harry's only hidden talent... check out what he can do with a mouthful of water!  SKILLZ.  5. He then threw his water bottle into the crowd and, of course, ALL hell broke loose!  Oh Harry!  6. There's also the dancing. SO MUCH DANCING!  Never stop Harry!  7. And of course not forgetting backstage... Harry's just there giving out massages to fans' mums!  Harry giving a fan's mum a massage pic.twitter.com/fSwSOcV79y — best harry pics (@thestylespics) September 5, 2015  Erm, we're actually feeling a little knotted too Harry, it's our turn next!  8. One fan's sign had a grammatical error so, naturally, Harry took it upon himself to correct it!  Thank you so much @Harry_Styles for signing my poster and also correcting my grammar!! pic.twitter.com/8v9xM6umbn — Taelor Ford (@taelor_ford) September 2, 2015  Stay in school, kids.  9. When Harry started protesting against Sea World on stage, casual.  Who knew Harry was such a 'Black Fish' documentary fan!  10. When he got so into the band he started singing a impromptu cover of 'I Will Survive'  And of course sounded FLAWLESS.  11. Then he found a rainbow flag, and took off around the stage with it in the best way ever.  12. That moment Harry gave the BEST face after trying (and sadly failing) to hit Zayn’s high note during a performance of ‘Diana’.  Harry was just so REAL in this moment. #LoveIt.  Harry we salute you.

The Duchess of Cambridge looked lovely in lace as she showed off her growing baby bump on Tuesday at the Anna Freud Centre Gala Dinner. Kate Middleton, who is currently expecting her third child, recycled her black Diane von Furstenberg Zarita gown — which she wore back in 2014 while she was pregnant with Princess Charlotte — for the special occasion.  Prince Harry’s girlfriend Meghan Markle owns a shorter, navy version of the Duchess’ DVF gown. Kate, 35, completed her elegant ensemble on November 7 by styling her glossy locks down in loose waves. The mom-of-two accessorized her look with a Prada clutch, a pair of Queen Elizabeth’s earrings, a diamond cuff bracelet and a patriotic Remembrance Poppy.

The Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families, of which the Duchess is patron, campaigns for a step change in children’s mental health and believes in the importance of early intervention. During the reception, Kate met with key supporters of the charity as well as families who benefit from it.  The Duchess showed off a hint of her growing baby bump at the gala dinner on November 7 Photo: Frank Augstein - WPA Pool/Getty Images  GALLERY: THE ROYAL PIECES KATE HAS BORROWED FROM THE QUEEN  Kensington Palace noted that Prince William's wife “has a continued desire to draw attention to child mental health issues, and the important work that [the Anna Freud Centre] is doing in this space.” Last week, Kate hosted a secret meeting to discuss maternal mental health. While Prince George's mom attended the gala on Tuesday evening alone, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge reportedly attended a charity lunch function at Berry Bros. & Rudd earlier in the day.	1

Kylie Jenner’s pregnancy cravings may be getting the best of her! We exclusively learned the star is struggling with her diet.  The holidays are known for throwing people off their diets, and apparently, Kylie Jenner, 20, is no exception! But while the reality star is apparently desperate to avoid excess weight gain, she’s finding herself craving all sorts of sugary desserts and unhealthy snacks. We don’t blame her for indulging either — after all, during the holidays it’s nearly impossible to completely refrain from satisfying your sweet tooth! Click here to see pics of Kylie’s and Khloe Kardashian’s pre-pregnancy bodies.  “ Kylie is struggling with pregnancy food cravings. She is overwhelmed with nowhere to turn because there is yummy holiday food everywhere she looks,” a source close to Kylie revealed to HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “She feels like being pregnant during the holidays is the most challenging time because everywhere she goes there is great food, snacks, and yummy treats.” Regardless, Kylie is at least TRYING to control her cravings. But apparently, it’s easier said than done. “ Kylie wants to eat healthier, and she knows how important it is for her baby to get good nutrition, but spending time with her family is making things hard,” our insider explained.  Making things even worse, Kylie’s been specifically spending a lot of time with her mom, Kris Jenner , 62. And her house is always fully stocked with treats. “She is often at her mom’s house where there are always muffins, cake, brownies, and other yummy, unhealthy things to eat that she simply can’t say no too.” And while Kylie hasn’t been overly concerned about weight gain in the past, now that she’s pregnant, it’s apparently something she thinks about on a regular basis!  “She has never worried about her weight, but now that she has a growing belly eating for two, she worries about gaining too much or gaining unhealthy weight,” our source added. “Kylie desperately wants to try to have a stricter diet and is trying to eat healthier, but it is hard when dealing with such strong cravings.”  Recently, the makeup mogul appeared in a video playing “Never Have I Ever” with BFF Jordyn Woods, 20, and her assistant Victoria Villarroel. And it was pretty obvious Kylie was rocking some major pregnancy curves. She clearly tried to cover her body up in an oversized holiday sweater, but fans could not be fooled! Looks like Kylie will have to come clean about her pregnancy sooner rather than later!  Tell us, HollywoodLifers — can you relate to Kylie wanting to eat yummy foods and treats during the holidays? Are you anxious for her to reveal her pregnancy at last?	0

"Prince Harry and Ms. Meghan Markle are incredibly grateful for the goodwill shown to them since the announcement of their engagement and are keen that as many people as possible benefit from this generosity of spirit. The couple have therefore asked that anyone who might wish to mark the occasion considers making a donation to charity, rather than sending a wedding gift.  Prince Harry and Ms. Markle have personally selected seven organisations they would like to support, reflecting their shared values.  Prince Harry and Ms. Markle do not have any formal relationships with the charities chosen. The couple have chosen charities which represent a range of issues that they are passionate about, including sport for social change, women's empowerment, conservation, the environment, homelessness, HIV and the Armed Forces. Many of these are small charities, and the couple are pleased to be able to amplify and shine a light on their work.  The charities chosen by Prince Harry and Ms. Markle are:  CHIVA (Children's HIV Association)  The Children’s HIV Association (CHIVA) supports children growing up with HIV and their families, across the UK and Ireland. The charity aims to enhance the wellbeing of children and young people with HIV and to create a more hopeful and optimistic future for them, ensuring they achieve their greatest potential.  Dr Amanda Williams, Chair of CHIVA, said: ""We are delighted and honoured that Prince Harry and Ms. Meghan Markle have chosen to recognise our work supporting the health and wellbeing of children and young people living with HIV in the UK and Ireland. We are grateful for the opportunity to raise awareness of the complex issues for young people growing up with HIV. We are a very small charity and through our work we support over 1,000 young people living with HIV. All donations will make a significant difference to our programmes of work and lead to direct improvements in the lives of these young people.""  Crisis is the national charity for homeless people. The charity helps people directly out of homelessness, working side by side with thousands of people each year to help them rebuild their lives and leave homelessness behind for good.  Jon Sparkes, Chief Executive of Crisis, said: “We are hugely grateful that Prince Harry and Ms. Markle are asking the public to support Crisis as they celebrate their wedding. Homelessness is one of the most urgent issues of our time, but at Crisis we know what it takes to end it. Donations will help us to support more people to leave homelessness behind through our housing, employment, education and advice services across the country, and to campaign for the changes needed to solve the homelessness crisis once and for all.”  Myna Mahila Foundation is a charity which empowers women in Mumbai’s urban slums, by providing them with a trusted network, where they are supported professionally and personally to help them grow as individuals and businesswomen. Myna offers women from these communities stable employment close to their homes, and breaks taboos around menstrual hygiene by offering women access to low cost sanitary pads and accurate information at their doorstep. Providing mothers in the community with these products helps them equip their daughters to stay in school. The pads are manufactured and distributed by women from these communities. The charity also empowers its staff through training in women's health, English, Math, and life skills such as self-defence.  Ms. Markle saw the work of the Foundation first hand when she visited the charity last year, and wrote about it in Time Magazine.  Suhani Jalota, who founded Myna Mahila in 2015, said: ""Myna Mahila Foundation is delighted to be a part of this special occasion for Ms. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry. This support will enable us to expand our reach into more urban slums in Mumbai, empowering local women through access to menstrual hygiene products and employment opportunities.""

He just couldn’t give up his bachelor kind of lifestyle.”  The former couple, whose love story became a dramatic plot line on “The Real Housewives of New York City,” faced rampant rumors of infidelity on his part during their courtship but nonetheless tied the knot in a glamorous wedding.  “It was a beautiful wedding, it was his birthday, it was one hell of a party and it was New Year’s Eve, so I don’t regret it.”  The reality star also maintains that the cameras didn’t fully capture their romantic side during their short-lived marriage, which was her second and his first.  “People don’t get to see that part, there was love, there was as good times,” the mom of two said. “I want people to know that it wasn’t just all of this scandalous talk in the papers.”  When asked if she’ll be deleting the evidence of her time with D’Agastino on social media, the Countess says the proof isn’t going anywhere.  “I don’t take the pictures down, I’m not that kind of person,” she said.  Moving forward, the reality star-turned-interior designer says she hasn’t been dating much and is “just chilling.” However, a source told us last month she’s actually “dating tons of people.”	1
"an American awards show  The People's Choice Awards, officially the E! People's Choice Awards since E! took it over in April 2017, is an American awards show, recognizing people in entertainment, voted online by the general public and fans. The show has been held annually since 1975,[1][2] with the winners originally determined using Gallup Polls until the switch to online voting in 2005.  The awards were created by Bob Stivers, who produced the first show in 1975.[3][4] The first awards recognized The Sting as Favorite Picture of 1974, Barbra Streisand as the year's Favorite Film Actress, and John Wayne as its Favorite Film Actor.[5] Ratings for the annual event peaked in 1977, when the third People's Choice Awards attracted 35.3 million viewers who witnessed Farrah Fawcett win the award for Favorite Female TV Star, Star Wars win as the Favorite Picture, and Streisand and Wayne win again in the Film Actress and Actor categories. So far, Ellen DeGeneres is the most awarded person, with a total of 20 awards.[6]  In 1982, Stiver sold the People's Choice Awards to Procter & Gamble Productions; under P&G, the ceremony was broadcast by CBS, and Procter & Gamble's brands held exclusive national advertising time across the entire telecast. In April 2017, the E! network announced that they had acquired the People's Choice Awards.[7][8]  In December 2017, E! announced that the 2018 ceremony would be held on November 11, 2018—moving from its previous January scheduling to reduce its proximity to the busier months of awards season. The ceremony was televised by E! and its international affiliates, with the network using an ""end-to-end"" experience to leverage its experience in covering other major awards shows.[9][10][11]  Categories [ edit ]  The award categories have varied over the years. For example, the 16th People's Choice Awards had categories including Favorite All-Around Movie (Batman), and both a Favorite Movie Actor (Tom Cruise) and a World Favorite Movie Actor (Dustin Hoffman). At the 23rd People's Choice Awards, Rob Reiner was named the People's Choice Awards Honoree. More recently, the 32nd People's Choice Awards (broadcast in January 2006) included categories such as Favorite On-Screen Match-Up (Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson in Wedding Crashers), Favorite Leading Lady (Reese Witherspoon), Favorite Tour (U2), and an award named after a Procter & Gamble brand: Nice 'n Easy Fans Favorite Hair (Faith Hill). In 2008, the People's Choice Awards introduced a new category: Favorite Sci-Fi Show. The nominees were Stargate Atlantis, Battlestar Galactica, and Doctor Who. Stargate Atlantis was the first recipient of the award.  Poll-based awards [ edit ]  In the 20th century, the awards were based on results from Gallup polls. Each year, Gallup took a survey of different categories for favorite actor, actress, movie, artist, television program or group. The scope was unlimited—the public could choose whomever or whatever it liked. The results of the annual survey were announced in the form of the People's Choice Awards. Since polls have margins of error, many years' awards have had ties in at least one category, when Gallup declared that the voting was so close that a single winner could not be chosen. For instance, in 2003, both Spider-Man and The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring were recognized as Favorite Motion Picture.  Switch to online voting [ edit ]  The winners of the 31st People's Choice Awards (on January 9, 2005) were decided by online voting rather than Gallup polls. The nominees submitted for Internet voting were selected using an unpublished process involving editors at Entertainment Weekly, the show's production team and a panel of pop culture fans.  The nominees for the 32nd People's Choice Awards were determined by the web research company Knowledge Networks, which took a nationally representative sample of men and women ages 18 to 54, with and without Internet access, to come up with the nominees.

Anna Faris isn’t sure she’ll ever tie the knot again after two divorces. While chatting with pal Dax Shepard for his podcast Armchair Expert, the actress said she needs to figure out what the point is.  “I need to figure out what the purpose is,” Faris said on Monday, March 26. “Is it safety for your children? Is it convention? Is it so other people respect your relationship more? For me, I’m just not quite sure where it fits, especially when it feels so easy to get married, and then the untangling — when the state gets involved.”  “There is the importance of how other people then treat you as a married man than as a man with a girlfriend,” she continued. “I do think it is important how other people respect a relationship … I’m not saying it’s a good reason, but it is a small benefit of having that label of being married.”  Her quotes come following her shocking split from husband Chris Pratt. In August 2017 the couple and parents to son Jack announced they were splitting after 8 years of marriage.  During her chat with Dax, she admitted that their #relationshipgoals beloved fan marriage didn’t help with the split.  “Chris and I did talk about [it]. We got, like, on the Twitter feed, ‘Love is dead’ and ‘relationship goals,'” she recalled of reading people’s reaction. “I think what we were also guilty of — we obviously cultivated something and it was rewarding for a while. It was like ‘People seem to think we got all this s--t right.’ ”	1

French Montana doesn’t like Alessandra’s new outfit. During tonight’s episode of MTV’s Fashion Police Video Music Awards special, the rapper joins several other hosts, including Brad Goreski, NeNe Leakes, Margaret Cho, Melissa Rivers, as well as Giuliana Rancic. On the show, the respective hosts discuss the red carpet styles for the prestigious event.  When it comes to fashion, no one is ever safe from being ripped apart by critics.  This indeed proved to be the case with the supermodel, Alessandra Ambrosio, who’s outfit was something totally out of this world.  And while we didn’t think her look was too bad, considering it shows how bold she is, the hosts of the MTV show were not quite as nice.  Reality star NeNe Leakes was one of the people who was just not feeling the outfit one bit.  She said, “It may all match, but this doesn’t work for me.”  The star said she could “rock it,” but Alessandra doesn’t, unfortunately.  Ouch!  NeNe went on to say, “I don’t care what you say, but she can’t do this.”  ?⚡️ M T V ⚡️? @vmas A post shared by Alessandra Ambrosio (@alessandraambrosio) on Aug 27, 2017 at 7:55pm PDT  Brad was also vocal in his critique of the ensemble.  The host claimed it was not a “$5,500 well spent.”  He added that it was a “mess, a mess.”  And finally, French Montana came in with a critique that was off-the-wall, to say the least.  The Morrocan-American rapper said it wasn’t “easy access.”  Advertisement  Margaret Cho said, “well, it might be crotch-less, you don’t know.” French responded with a hearty, “I like your style!” That’s a bit raunchy is it not? Let us know what you think of her white and black outfit in the comment section below.	1
"Watch @NicoleKidman cast some well-deserved shade at @Andy Cohen after he asks her a seriously questionable question on live television #CNNNYE pic.twitter.com/ZA3KfZNhG7 — Anderson Cooper 360° (@AC360) January 1, 2018  Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban threw shade all the way from Nashville to Times Square on New Year's Eve when Andy Cohen asked the couple a slightly controversial question during CNN's live broadcast.  The power couple called in from Nashville and talked to Cohen and his co-host, Anderson Cooper, when Cohen asked them about Kidman's famous clapping from the 2017 Oscars and whether they expected it to become a popular meme.  ""I mean, it's called a logical clap when you don't want to slam your hands together with rings,"" Urban replied after a brief pause, ""but what do you want to do?""  The Oscar-winning actress then added, ""I wish that there was more important things to be concerned about or that people were focused on more important things than that sort of clapping. That's what I would say.""  Things became a bit more awkward when Urban lost his ear piece while trying to show Cohen and Cooper the crowd in Nashville, where Urban was performing for the city's New Year's Eve celebration, and couldn't hear the interviewers.  Luckily, the interview ended on an amicable note with everyone wishing each other a happy New Year. After the call ended, Cohen realized Kidman had given him a little jab.  ""That was amazing. That was so cool that Nicole Kidman joined in,"" Cohen said. ""I think she just shaded me a little bit.""  ""Well yeah, she did. Yes,"" Cooper agreed.  ""I guess she's not coming on my show,"" the Watch What Happens Live host concluded.  Cooper seemed to understand Kidman's viewpoint. In a tweet, he described her comments as ""some well deserved shade.""  The CNN anchor then mentioned that Cohen has lots of celebrity guests on his Bravo talk show.  ""Not Nicole Kidman,"" Cohen responded."	1
Will Smith has become the latest celebrity to take on the In My Feelings challenge, taking the viral dance to new heights in Budapest.  The Fresh Prince scaled a bridge in the Hungarian capital to show off his moves to Drake’s track, a dance craze started by comedian Shoker last month.  In the video posted on his Instagram page, Smith admitted: “There’s no way…no way this is legal,” as he made his way to the very top of the bridge and copied the moves.  At the end, he said: “I woke up this morning in my feelings and I was like, ‘I got to let them out!”  Smith captioned the post: “Last day in Budapest. I woke up #InMyFeelings  “I’ma Keep It 100.. I was TERRIFIED up there. That’s why my dance moves is all STIFF! Haha #InMyFeelingsChallenge #DoTheShiggy.”  Fans immediately declared Smith had “won” the challenge sweeping social media and quickly earned recognition from the Canadian rapper himself.  Drake commented: “Wow the video is done.”  The Suicide Squad actor is one of many famous faces to take on the latest dance social media sensation since its inception.  Pop sensation Ciara, comedian Kevin Hart and even Drake have recreated the dance, sweeping the Internet much like the Mannequin challenge.  The challenge stemmed from comedian Shoker - who produces The Shiggy Show - on June 29 when Drake's album Scorpion was released.	1
"Selena Gomez has come a long way with her music. Just when you think you have her all figured out, the Disney Channel alum does a total 180 and switches things up on her fans. So to celebrate our brand-new artist evolution column, we figured taking a look back at all her music would be the perfect way to kick things off.  From releasing the ultimate pop jam ""One and the Same"" to accompany one of her first Disney Channel Original Movies in 2009 with Demi Lovato to doing the ultimate Revival for her 2015 album and working with A$AP Rocky, there’s no type of music Selena isn’t afraid to explore. Most recently she dabbled with the likes of EDM as she released her newest single “It Ain’t Me” with DJ Kygo, who also worked with her collaborator Charlie Puth. Now as she teased new music from the studio over the weekend on Instagram, we can’t help but wonder what she’ll surprise us with next.  The star certainly has her way of keeping people guessing. As you wait for her to wow you with her next hit, get lost in our roundup of all her tracks. (We’ll even take you all the way to her humble beginnings on Barney and Friends.

Postby Guest » Wed May 02, 2018 1:05 pm  By Andrew Shuster | 3:29 pm, May 1, 2018    A tabloid report claiming Brad Pitt is seeking advice from George Clooney on his supposed romance with Neri Oxman is completely made-up. As Gossip Cop has repeatedly stressed, the movie star isn’t dating the MIT professor, so this entire story is based on a lie.    According to Woman’s Day, Pitt is inspired by Clooney’s marriage to wife Amal, a human rights lawyer who works completely outside of Hollywood. Oxman is an architecture professor who also has no ties to the movie industry, so Pitt supposedly asked his friend how to keep her interested once his star power wears off.    As the story goes, Clooney would rather tease his friend than offer him guidance. A so-called “source” tells the magazine, “George loves that Brad has been thrown off his game and makes fun of him endlessly. It’s sweet payback for all the jokes Brad tossed his way after George started dating Amal.”    The outlet’s questionable insider goes on to say that although Clooney has been messing with Pitt, Amal has actually been “advising Neri on ways to keep calm and grounded amid the media circus.” The seemingly nonexistent tipster further contends that Pitt “is very grateful” for Amal because “he’s not used to having a non-famous girlfriend and Neri never expected to be in the limelight.”    The tabloid’s article, however, is nothing more than fan fiction. Pitt’s rep has told us on the record several times that the actor isn’t dating Oxman. This has been backed up by trusted publications such as People, which recently noted Pitt and Oxman have a “professional friendship,” as while as E! News, which similarly reported that Pitt and Oxman are “strictly friends.”    This article only seems to exist because Woman’s Day came up with a way to drag Clooney into his pal’s imaginary romance. In addition to the fact that Pitt and Oxman aren’t a couple, a mutual pal of ours and Clooney tells us on background that the actor’s friend hasn’t turned to him for advice about dating the MIT professor. This is just a fabricated story based on a phony premise.    It’s worth noting, this isn’t the first time Gossip Cop has had to debunk a bogus story about Clooney supposedly playing a role in his friend’s love life. We recently busted New Idea for making up a story about Clooney getting Pitt and Jennifer Aniston back together. This latest article involving Oxman is equally untrue.	0
"Jingle Jangle is an addictive drug on Riverdale. Most of the teenage Southside Serpents use it, and so do some of the kids at Riverdale High School. Robert Phillips, also known as the ""Sugarman"", was the supplier of these drugs, who sold them to Ghoulies, who then distributed them throughout the streets of Riverdale. The Ghoulies also made some supplies inside of The House of the Dead.  Contents show]  Description  Jingle Jangle is a drug used as a stimulant, and, according to Reggie Mantle, is able to boost energy and keep the user wide-awake, also implying reinvigorating sexual performance as one of its effects. Toni Topaz also pointed out that this drug is highly addictive, a ""total gutter drug"", in reference to some Southside High's students. Jingle Jangle is consumed with a paper straw, and stays in your system for three days, according to Sheriff Keller.  History  Throughout the years they were many Sugarmen, each taking over the last previous Sugarman, they were described to be monsters, by Penelope Blossom.  Throughout the Series  Midge Klump approached Reggie Mantle by his locker looking to score some ""Jingle Jangle"", a new drug that has found its way onto the north side of Riverdale. After instructing Midge to keep her voice down on school property because the simple mentioning of the drug can land them both in a lot of trouble, Reggie asked who the Jingle Jangle was for, to which she replied that it was for her and Moose Mason. Reggie told her that he'll see what he can do.  The following night, Reggie delivered the Jingle Jangle in the diner's parking lot to Midge and Moose, attempting to do it in secret, but ended up being photographed by Alice Cooper, unbeknownst to Reggie and his clients. The couple then consumed the drug at a secluded location at Lovers' Lane, which ends them up in the Black Hood's line of fire.[1]  While Toni Topaz was giving Jughead Jones a tour of Southside High, she pointed out a group of kids consuming Jingle Jangle in their natural habitat. Later that day, Mr. Philips agreed to reopen the Red and Black as long as Jughead didn't include Jingle Jangle or gangs within the paper.[2]  Nick St. Clair hosts a party in his room in the Five Seasons hotel. To make the party more interesting, he pulls out a few straws of the drug out of his jacket, and offers the members of the party a straw; everyone accepts, though Betty declines.[3]  At the Cooper house, it was revealed to the parents of the attendees of Nick St. Clair's small gathering that their children abused the drug. Reggie Mantle revealed that he supplied Nick with the Jingle Jangle, and that he acquired it from a Southside teen, who he suspected of being a Southside Serpent that attended Southside High. The mayor, Sierra McCoy, was especially furious towards the revelation of her daughter, Josie McCoy, using the drug. After learning that the use of Jingle Jangle was effecting her home life with her daughter, Mayor McCoy announced that her number one priority would be taking back the Southside and the eradication of Jingle Jangle.  Moving forward with her plan, Mayor McCoy and Sheriff Keller raided Southside High, arresting every Southside Serpent in sight, including Sweet Pea and Toni Topaz.  In order to reveal the Sugarman's identity, Veronica Lodge attempted to buy some of the drug from a dealer whom Reggie was a customer. When she arrived at the location, she said the word ""Sugarman"" and how he created this drug. The dealer seemed shocked hearing that word, and raced off.[4]  Chic reveals that his former roommate, Charles Smith, had overdosed on Jingle Jangle; however, their next-door-neighbor knew nothing of a drug problem. Instead, she claims that they fought all the time and then one day there was only one. She also explained how she noticed bloody sheets and pillows in the dumpster when she took out her trash, suggesting a far more sinister conclusion between Chic and Charles.[5]  At the speakeasy, Veronica and Reggie discover a la"	1
"The talk-show queen has arrived!  Oprah Winfrey arrived at St. George's Chapel in Windsor on Saturday, where the royal wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will take place.  Winfrey wore a long-sleeved, pink Stella McCartney dress and matching Philip Treacy hat. She accessorized her look with a purse and heels. She also arrived wearing sunglasses. According to her best friend and CBS This Morning host Gayle King, Winfrey had a bit of a fashion emergency and had to switch her dress at the last minute because it was too white—a color traditionally reserved for the bride.  Winfrey was one of the first celebrity guests to arrive at the Windsor Castle chapel. Winfrey was told she had to leave three hours early to make it on time and travelled by bus.  ""I said, 'Oprah has to ride the bus? Oprah is not a bus person. Has she been informed?!'"" King said.  Fans started to speculate if Winfrey would attend the royal wedding after she was spotted in London attending the Tina Turner musical Tina: The Musical on Friday. Daily Mail also reported that the mother of the bride, Doria Ragland, visited Winfrey's mansion in Calif. in late April."	1

"It's been nearly a year since Christina and Tarek El Moussa's explosive fight that resulted in the two splitting up, but it appears the Flip or Flop stars are not completely over it.  On Thursday, Tarek posted a photo to his Instagram story of himself posing in front of a sign at BJ's Cabana Bar in Lake Havasu City, Arizona. The sign read, ""No guns, weapons of any type."" Tarek added text to the snap, writing ""or helicopters,"" tagging his estranged wife and topping it off with a middle finger emoji.    WATCH: 'Flip or Flop' Exes Tarek v. Christina El Moussa: It's a Battle of the Revenge Bods!  The reality star has since deleted the pic, but judging by what Christina posted to her Instagram on Friday, we imagine she wasn't too happy when she saw it.  The blond beauty shared a photo of the Empire State Building with the quote, ""No time for bullshit when you're building an empire.""  ""True that,"" she captioned it. Only surround yourself with the best ❤""  But that's not all! Tarek even gave the post a ""like.""  A source close to Tarek later told TMZ that his post was supposed to be a joke, and he tagged Christina thinking she would find it funny. The middle finger emoji was reportedly directed at the incident, not his co-star.  On Friday, Tarek tried to clear the air with an Instagram post that read, ""#life is about having #fun and enjoying every #moment....people shouldn't take things so seriously especially JOKES that are meant to be playful and fun...""  Many of Tarek's fans took to social media to express their support, writing things like, ""Reading the comments people leave you makes me realize how many sadly have no sense of humor,"" ""The fact that you're able to joke about your past means that you've already moved on... I admire your personality,"" and ""The only way to get through life is with a little humor!! Keep doing great things!!""    WATCH: Tarek and Christina El Moussa's Shocking Split: Everything We Know About the 'Flip or Flop' Couple  Last December, the couple confirmed they were taking a step back from their marriage following an incident on May, 23 2016 that led to the police being called to their Orange County, California, home. At the time, Tarek allegedly had a handgun and the Sherriff's Department responded to a report of a ""suicidal male"" with a helicopter.  More on that in the video below."	1
The clock is ticking for ABC’s ‘American Idol’ reboot to find two more judges to join Katy Perry. We’ve got EXCLUSIVE details on how producers have their eyes on Selena Gomez to join the show.  It would be pretty awkward to see Taylor Swift‘s BFF Selena Gomez, 25, sitting next to arch-enemy Katy Perry, 32, week after week on American Idol, but the “Fetish” singer is at the top of the show producers’ wish-list for judges. “Producers think that Selena would be great to join the judging panel because she’d bring in a younger crowd for ratings, she’d be considered the nice judge and they would love her to join because the impact she has with social media,” an AI insider tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Sel is the most followed person on Instagram with a whopping 127 million followers, so of course the show would love to have a judge who can reach so many people.  “They are putting together a proposal for her and are hoping she will accept it and join the show, it’s a long shot but they are taking the chance to get her. They’d love to have her signed up and all judges by mid October,” our insider adds. So far the show has been striking out right and left when it comes to getting other stars to join Katy on the panel. ABC reportedly spent a whopping $25 million to land her back in May, which is over half of the show’s budget. As a result, they don’t have much money left over to get other top names. After all, who wants to do the same job as Katy for a fraction of the paycheck? Especially in Selena’s case, she is the bigger star these days! See pics of beautiful Selena, right here.  If by some chance Selena actually agrees to join the show, they definitely need a “nice” judge cause Katy said she won’t be holding back when it comes to the contestants’ talent. She called in to On Air With Ryan Seacrest on Aug. 23, to give her judging strategy. “I’m going to maybe be more the Simon Cowell. I really respect him. As much as people said, ‘Oh, he’s grumpy or he’s mean,’ he was just truthful, you know? He’s seen it. I don’t need to be there to win the popular race.” She added, “Honestly sob stories come second for me. Everyone has a situation and God bless them…but if you don’t have the goods, you don’t have the goods.” Brutal!    HollywoodLifers, do you think it would be a good career move for Selena to join American Idol? Or would be it be a big step down?	0

THE MOST NOTICEABLE thing about Angelina Jolie Pitt —apart from her almost preternatural physical presence—is that nearly everywhere she goes she turns up more or less unattended (unless, of course, you count husband Brad Pitt and their brood of six). Arriving for an interview at a West Hollywood hotel suite to promote By the Sea, her upcoming movie with Pitt, she’s trailed only by a lone bodyguard—she doesn’t employ a manager or even a publicist. A few weeks earlier, photos of the Jolie-Pitt clan’s visit to a Subway in Glendale, California, had been splashed across multiple websites (“They’re just like us!”), but the trip from which Jolie Pitt has returned just before the interview—an outing to a lakeside retreat the couple owns near Pitt’s hometown of Springfield, Missouri—had gone entirely unnoticed. (“It’s a real Midwestern family kind of place,” says Tom Brokaw, who got to know Jolie Pitt during the making of her most recent film, Unbroken. “His whole family comes down, cousins, you name it.”) Likewise, the couple’s wedding ceremony at their château in the south of France in August 2014 was not followed by a romantic getaway featuring the typical telescopic paparazzi shots of sunbathing on a yacht. The two went back to work almost immediately, shooting the new film together on a tiny island in Malta, “while our children ran around the set,” says Pitt. “That this became our honeymoon is just f—ing funny.” WSJ. Magazine November 2015 All this under-the-radar normalcy would not be noteworthy in the least if the two stars weren’t the most staggeringly high-profile Hollywood couple since Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton (except with only three divorces between them and not nearly as much booze or bling). This month, in By the Sea, they’ll appear together for the first time in a decade, since the action-packed romp Mr. and Mrs. Smith introduced them to the world as a couple onscreen and (subsequently, they insist) off. Though the new film, by Jolie Pitt’s own account, is a “small” one, it will likely attract a lot of interest in the media juggernaut known as Brangelina—especially since the story involves a couple whose marriage is in deep crisis. The movie, set in an isolated seaside hotel in France, lays them emotionally bare in a way they’ve rarely been seen before, and certainly not together. “It was not easy,” says Jolie Pitt. “We just had to be brave and say, ‘OK, honey, we’re strong enough to do this; let’s somehow use this to make us stronger.’ ” Jolie Pitt wrote the script, her first, not long after her mother, Marcheline Bertrand, died in 2007. “I didn’t really know if I could make film and I didn’t think I could write film, so I wrote with a certain amount of freedom,” she says. “I gave myself the task that it would be about grief and how different people react to and process it.” In one scene, the local barkeep (played by a remarkable French actor, Niels Arestrup) talks to Pitt’s character, who is trying to restart a foundering writing career, about forcing himself to love his terminally ill wife enough to let her go. “That’s me speaking about my mother,” Jolie Pitt says. “I think maybe his character came from the purest place inside me.” The actress-writer-director Angelina Jolie Pitt occupies a rarefied station in contemporary culture, at once a Hollywood icon and compassionate humanitarian. A film by MediaStorm The most difficult scenes of the film were made harder by the fact that “we had to stay in our corners, like boxers, and not be husband and wife,” Jolie Pitt says. “It was very hard to do those scenes without Brad and I taking care of each other. Normally in between takes, you’d make sure that the other’s OK, but we had to be able to really get ugly.” At the end of the day, she adds, it was the kids who kept them from staying in character. “That might have been an absolute disaster. But as soon as we got home, it was bedtime stories, children’s needs and problems, the fights they’d had during the day. We	0

"In Wonder Woman, Gal Gadot found the role model she'd always wanted to play.  The DC superhero movie star was presented the second ever #SeeHer Award at the Critics' Choice Awards on Thursday, which honors more accurate portrayals of women in film. Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins presented Gadot with the award, who went on to address Time's Up and the current movement of women speaking out with their stories of sexual harassment and called for more women leading films -- and in the director's chair.  ""Throughout my career, I was asked to describe my dream role, and it was clear to me that I wanted to play a strong and independent woman. A real one,"" the Israeli actress shared. ""When I started acting, there were very few female-led movies and even fewer female directors.""  ""In the past weeks and months, we've been witnessing a movement within our industry and society,"" Gadot continued. ""We will band together to make strides, uniting for equality.""  Gadot follows in the footsteps of Viola Davis, who won the first award at last year's show.  Watch the video below for more of what Gadot has said about the Time's Up initiative.

The Queen has entrusted her senior aide, Samantha Cohen, with the task of showing the Duchess the ropes, and has even relocated Samantha from Buckingham Palace to Kensington Palace to be closer to Meghan.  Meghan officially became part of the royal family after her May 19 wedding to Prince Harry. Photo: Getty More  “It will be six months of listening,” a source told the Daily Mail.  “She is seeking out advice from a range of people. She is going to proceed with humility. It is not going to be quiet, though. It is going to be a very busy office. She has worked every day of her life. she is used to a demanding schedule.”  Samantha is said to be a no-nonsense instructor.  The Queen is determined to make sure Meghan undergoes intensive training, and has enlisted her own staff. Photo: Getty More  Samantha was seen attending Prince Harry and Meghan’s wedding. Photo: Getty More  Nicknamed, ‘Samantha the Panther’, she’s said to have worked closely with Meghan to prepare her for the Buckingham Palace Garden Party celebrating Prince Charles’s 70th birthday.  Samantha the Panther bared her claws when she was tasked with planning a party at Buckingham Palace to celebrate the 200 most powerful women in Britain.

"Coldplay was among the performers at a charity concert over the summer called One Love Manchester. Talent executive Scooter Braun helped organize the lineup. The 36-year-old orchestrated the tribute shortly after the terrorist attack outside an Ariana Grande concert in Northern England.  Grande is one of more than two dozen clients Braun represents at SB Projects. Others include Justin Bieber, Usher and the Black Eyed Peas. He's made the company so successful that 21-time Grammy winner Kanye West called Braun personally to represent him. ""CBS This Morning"" co-host Gayle King spoke with Braun about his recent philanthropy, working with Justin Bieber and the rumors that he is considering a future career in politics.  ""We'd been friends a long time. And all of a sudden – one thing led to another. And I told him, 'Look, I probably shouldn't manage you. We're friends. Better not doing' – he goes, 'No, you need to be part of the team,'"" Braun said. ""And I said, 'Well, why don't we get together in a week and we'll see?' And, like, the next day, I get a phone call from Adidas and Def Jam saying, 'We were told to deal with you, that you're in charge,'"" Braun said.  ""And I – the next day. And I call Kanye and I said, 'I thought we'd talk in a week.' He goes, 'I don't have time to wait a week. You're in. And that was that,'"" Braun said.  Scooter Braun and Gayle King CBS News  Kanye West, is one of many stars on Braun's talent roster. Braun's artist management and entertainment company now has 28 clients, including Karlie Kloss and Ariana Grande. After over a decade in the industry, Braun is still best known for discovering a 13-year-old kid from Canada on YouTube.  ""I was blown away when I saw him sing Ne-Yo, 'So Sick' – because he sang with such soul. And I thought here's a kid who could do that Michael Jackson model of angelic songs that made you believe in love again before you grew up and got jaded,"" Braun said.  Braun helped guide Bieber from internet obscurity to global recognition. It's been a 10-year career full of public highs and lows. In July, he canceled the remaining 14 dates of his world tour. He apologized to fans, citing struggles with ""broken relationships"" and ""insecurities.""  Braun said deciding to cancel the tour was an ""extremely"" difficult decision but wouldn't say exactly what's going on with the star.    ""Look, I think he'll decide to tell people when he's ready of what exactly happened. But I think he was making a decision, like he said, to protect himself. But he's 23 years old, now,"" Braun said. ""And if he makes a decision as a man, as long as he's willing to listen to opinions and hear people out – if he has true conviction, I'm willing to have his back.""  Braun says Bieber isn't just a client, he's family, but admits the trials throughout his career have, at times, been difficult.  Asked if those trials have strained their relationship, Braun said, ""Absolutely. Because I – I wasn't willing to be a yes man. I wasn't willing to stand by. And I also had never been through it before. He was going through really hard times, and for a year and a half, I failed -- completely.""  ""I tried every single thing to get him back on the right track, and I failed time and time again. And my dad gave me great advice. He said, 'Look. Your responsibility isn't to change him. It's to be a rock,'"" Braun said.  Braun, who remains close with his family, learned a hard lesson from his father about lying as a teen.  ""There was one day I was about 14 years old. And he came out in the back yard, and I got in trouble for, like, a white lie a couple days earlier. And he said, 'I wanna talk to you,'"" Braun recounted. ""I said, 'Okay, dad, what's up?' And he said, 'You know what you did a couple days – you know, you lied, we caught you. And I keep thinking about how well you lied. And I want you to know I know you're a liar.' And, you know, my dad was my hero, so him calling me a liar, that hurt.""    Those words stuck with Braun and even inf"	0
Amazon has cut one of its most successful original series, “Transparent,” which will end after its fifth season.  But “Transparent” is only one of many shows Amazon has canceled this year.  In January, Amazon had a big night at the 2018 Golden Globes, with high-profile wins for its hit comedy series, “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.”  Then it turned around and canceled three shows at once: “Jean-Claude Van Johnson,” “One Mississippi,” and “I Love Dick.” In April, it canceled “Mozart in the Jungle,” another Golden Globe winner, after four seasons.  In May, Amazon announced that “Transparent” would end after the upcoming season five. Its star, Emmy winner Jeffrey Tambor, was fired from his starring role after being accused of sexually harassing two women on the set (he has denied it).  The string of cancellations in 2018 comes as Amazon continues to clean house after a management shakeup.

Dir: Zack Snyder; Starring: Ben Affleck, Gal Gadot, Ezra Miller, Jason Momoa, Ray Fisher, Jeremy Irons, Henry Cavill, Amy Adams, Diane Lane, Connie Nielsen, JK Simmons, Ciarán Hinds (voice). 12A cert, 120 mins.  “A man I knew used to say that hope was like your car keys,” quips Superman (Henry Cavill) at the beginning of Justice League, into a cameraphone clutched by a couple of flustered schoolboy fans. “It’s easy to lose, but if you dig around, it’s usually close by.”  Yet there’s no trace of the stuff in Warner Bros’ latest hapless attempt to jump-start their DC Comics blockbuster brand, which at this point looks less like a cinematic universe than a pop-cultural black hole, sucking up as much money and audience goodwill as the studio can shovel into it.  After a four-film build-up that began four years ago with Man of Steel, Justice League should have felt like a culmination, with Batman and Wonder Woman recruiting new heroes and bringing back Superman in order to fend off an extraterrestrial invasion, in much the same way the Avengers did for Marvel five years ago.  Instead, it feels like a sheepish feature-length retraction of the franchise to date. It’s consistently embarrassing to watch, and features plot holes so yawningly vast they have a kind of Grand Canyon-like splendour: part of you wants to hang around to see what they look like at sunset.	1
Before Alden Ehrenreich took on the biggest role of his life, he took a trip out to Death Valley in California. He hired a high-end tepee, drank green juice and contemplated what playing the young Han Solo would mean.  “I wanted to make sure I was really choosing to do this myself. And it wasn’t just because everybody in my life would think I was a lunatic if I said I didn’t want to.” It was time well spent, even if his conclusion was hardly surprising. “When I really looked at it, I really wanted to do it.”  It’s Thursday morning at the Cannes Film Festival, where Solo: A Star Wars Story was unveiled to the world’s media two nights earlier. Ehrenreich, a sleepy-looking soul in a red lumberjack shirt and black jeans, has been living with taking over from Harrison Ford in one of the most recognisable roles in the Star Wars universe for two and a half years now.  Download the new Indpendent Premium app Sharing the full story, not just the headlines  Not that this makes it any easier. The roguish space pirate Solo has been Ford’s role alone for four decades.  “I’m lucky enough that this is happening after I’ve been working for 14 years,” he says. “For me, starting out and having less experience was more intense. This is intense but I have a certain set of tools at this point as far as coping.  “What do I have control over? I have control over my job, and my part and how much work I do on it. I don’t have control over how well it turns out, how good the movie is, what anybody thinks or what anybody I’m working with thinks.”  Certainly the 28-year-old Ehrenreich is no beginner. A Los Angeles native, he’s already been to Cannes before with his debut, Francis Ford Coppola’s 2009 road movie Tetro (they reunited for the horror Twixt two years later).  “I sat down with Francis and auditioned for him for about five months and then he went and put me in his film,” he recalls. “We went and filmed in Argentina together. No trailers. It was just me sitting on his lap asking questions! It was a film school.”  Since then, he’s worked for South Korean director Park Chan-wook on the psychological thriller Stoker and popped up in Woody Allen’s Oscar-winning Blue Jasmine. More significantly, he was a co-lead in Warren Beatty’s Howard Hughes biopic Rules Don’t Apply and memorable in the Coen Brothers’ 1950s Hollywood comedy Hail, Caesar! as a rope-swirling TV cowboy.  “I’ve been so insanely lucky,” he drawls, “The real gratification is that you get to be shoulder to shoulder [with these people] and be the beneficiary of their brilliance.”  There are even strange connections to his casting in Solo, which is directed by Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind), who once starred with Harrison Ford in 1973’s American Graffiti, the film George Lucas made before directing the first Star Wars instalment. Coppola produced American Graffiti and it was cast by Fred Roos, who was also responsible for putting Ehrenreich in Tetro some 35 years later.  Even before Tetro, Ehrenreich had contact with Lucas and Coppola’s old buddy, Steven Spielberg. “My mum [Sari, an interior designer] never wanted me to act professionally,” he explains. “And I really didn’t want to. I wanted a normal childhood and whatnot.”  But then he and a friend made a video for their pal’s bar mitzvah – which was attended by Spielberg. “He liked me from the video, so he introduced me to DreamWorks. I got an agent through them and started acting professionally.”  To complete this circle of Hollywood’s Movie Brats, Ehrenreich met Lucas, who came to the Solo set. Crucially, he also spent time with Ford before the shoot commenced, at an airplane hanger in Santa Monica where they had lunch. Naturally, they talked about the character, although the typically reticent Ford swore Ehrenreich to secrecy.  “Harrison said, ‘If anyone asks, tell them I taught you everything you need to know and you’re not allowed to say anything!’”  Whatever he told him, it worked. Ehrenreich captures Solo’s gruff charms and misplace	1
    Long before Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux tied the knot (and ultimately split), he was perfectly happy with the status of their relationship. In fact, a source tells Us Weekly that the actor wouldn’t have minded if they never walked down the aisle at all.  “He had reservations at the time because they still hadn’t figured out where they were going to live as a couple. Justin was absolutely head over heels in love with Jen — and probably always will be — but marriage was never important to him,” the insider says of Theroux, who was previously in a 14-year relationship with costume designer Heidi Bivens. “Marriage was always just a piece of paper to Justin, and he didn’t need it.”  But Aniston did. “Constant scrutiny of Jen’s personal life, including whether she would ever find her happily ever after, played a huge role in her marriage to Justin,” the source tells Us. “It was obvious Jen needed more than an engagement or to be life partners with Justin. He didn’t want to lose her, so they got married.”  In the end, things didn’t work out and the couple decided to call it quits after two years of marriage. “In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation,” they told Us in a joint statement on Thursday, February 15. “This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.”  Aniston, 49, and Theroux, 46, added, “Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else’s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.”  The separation was caused in part by distance. “Jen tried the whole living in New York City thing with Justin, but at heart, she is a California girl,” a source previously told Us. “New York City wasn’t ever going to be home for Jen.”  With reporting by Jen Heger.	0

Paris Jackson mixed royalty with down-to-earth sensibility in her Met Gala ensemble.  The 20-year-old model arrived alongside designer Stella McCartney and singer Miley Cyrus dressed in a long burnt sienna frock and a tiara.

17 The Case of Well, A Big Misunderstanding But Here We All Are Anyway  Featuring: Jax, James and Kristen.  On the seasonal cast trip to Playa del Carmen, Jax spotted Kristen hanging out poolside early one morning — still up from partying the night before. Oh, and he also says he saw her and James in the hot tub together the night before. Now, not only do these two have history, but their significant others (Carter and Raquel, respectively) are not on the trip. Also though, this is JAX TALKING.    The devil is in the details, then (AKA the closed captioning, mercifully provided by the show). On the golf course later, Tom Sandoval asks James if he'd “hung out” with Kristen and, innocently enough, James responds in the affirmative. Here’s where wires got crossed: the rest of the guys who were listening thought Tom said, “hook up” instead of “hang out.”  News quickly spreads through the resort to the rest of the cast and lines are immediately drawn in the sand. For whatever reason (JK, it’s tequila), no one quite remembers Tom and James’ exact conversation, culminating in Kristen and James having a screaming match at dinner. She throws a drink at him and he storms out, calling her a “ratchet whore.”  The gang decamps back to LA, where James has the full support of Raquel. Kristen has a harder time breaking down the rumour to long-time boyfriend, Carter. Why? Well… in the very early days of Kristen and Carter’s relationship, she had hooked up with James (and had sex with him on the hood of her BMW).  And that’s not it! Jax, for some reason incensed that James and Kristen are getting away with “something,” has a middle-finger meltdown at SUR, which causes him to be kicked out by his bosses, Lisa and Ken. How does this story end? We will find out at the season 6 reunion.	1
Princess Michael of Kent apologizes for wearing 'racist' brooch in front of Meghan Markle  This week a certain royal's fashion choice made headlines for all the wrong reasons — and now she's apologizing for it.  Princess Michael of Kent, who is married to the queen's first cousin, was criticized for wearing a blackamoor brooch in front of Meghan Markle, Prince Harry's fiancé, during a Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace Wednesday.  Many deemed the brooch, which depicts an African woman, as racially insensitive as it dates back to a now criticized 18th-century art style that fetishizes slavery and people of color.  In a statement to People and The Daily Mail Friday, a representative for the royal said, “The brooch was a gift and has been worn many times before. Princess Michael is very sorry and distressed that it has caused offense.”  Markle, who is set to join the royal family when she marries Harry on May 19, 2018, is of mixed race. Her mother is African-American and her father is Caucasian.	1
"Try as he might, Corden can't escape the actor.  James Corden has learned to cower every time Kurt Russell comes along.  In a new bit for The Late Late Show, Russell's friendly greetings to Corden are quick to turn violent, escalating from one encounter to the next. At first, they meet and Russell talks about how cool and fun Corden is, giving him a ""light"" punch on the arm that leaves Corden clutching himself in pain.  The next time they interact, he kicks Corden in the face while telling him how much he loves him.  ""I love you too, you crazy bastard,"" Corden says as he lays in the fetal position on the floor.  The third incident is particularly volatile, with Russell happily throwing Corden through walls with a smile. When Corden ends up in the hospital, he wakes up to realize that he can never truly escape Kurt Russell, even in a medical institution.  The veteran actor, who starred in Escape From New York and Escape From L.A. among other films, will next hit theaters in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, out May 5.  Watch the sketch below."	1

While filming “Mission: Impossible – Fallout” with 56-year-old Cruise last spring, paparazzi caught the co-stars kissing on set and the tabloids went wild.  “Even though the [film] crew were there, it was all [in the tabloids] like, ‘The next wife falls at his feet,'” Kirby, 30, told Marie Claire UK in a new interview. “The most disconcerting thing was the people I didn’t think would believe it, did, and they were texting my boyfriend, asking, ‘Are you OK?’ I don’t think they believe anything they read now because you just can’t.  “None of it is real,” Kirby added. “To be getting married to him? Not even a snog, it was marriage.”  “The Crown” actress has been dating actor Callum Turner for two years and plans to keep that part of her life private.  “I’ve been lucky because I barely get recognized, and I keep my relationship super private,” Kirby shared. “[Turner is] just completely wonderful and he’s my best friend, so that’s … I guess you can either choose to talk about it or not.”  She added, “If you talk about it, it becomes interesting to people, but if you don’t, then it’s not.”	0

"Absolutely nowhere is safe for Tristan Thompson, not even Canada. On Tuesday night, the Cavs played against the Toronto Raptors for a thrilling first game that went into overtime. Raptors fans, including Drake, definitely aren't happy with last night's outcome, but there are other storylines taking place, including off the court, as fans took advantage of the opportunity to troll Thompson hardcore for being caught in a cheating scandal.  As E! News points out, while Thompson was at the free throw line toward the end of the game, fans began chanting Khloé in unison. Take a listen in the clip below.  'Khloe' chants for Tristan Thompson in Toronto... pic.twitter.com/bbcZ1SNk6e — Dime on UPROXX (@DimeUPROXX) May 2, 2018  Thompson still made the shot as people poked fun at his recently aired out dirty laundry. Last month, reports surfaced from multiple outlets that Thompson was cheating on his nine-months pregnant baby mama Khloé Kardashian. More video later surfaced, revealing that Thompson is a serial cheater, and probably fooled around with at least five women not named Khloé.  The reality TV star recently gave birth to their first baby girl, True Thompson, and is reportedly attempting to make things work, but Kim is definitely not here for it. ""Like I don't even know how to describe it besides it's just so fucked up,"" she told Ellen DeGeneres last week. ""We really were rooting for Khloé, and we still are...you know, she's so strong and she's doing the best that she can. It's a really sad situation all over.""

WWE News: Carmella finally reveals the reason behind her breakup with Big Cass  Phillipa Marie FOLLOW ANALYST News 19 Jan 2018, 00:59 IST SHARE  Carmella speaks up about her break up  What's the story?  Speculation began a few months ago that Carmella and Big Cass had gone their separate ways after it was noted that Carmella had removed all of the images of her and her former boyfriend from Instagram and Social Media.  This speculation has finally been made official recently since Carmella has publicly revealed the reasons behind their split, on the latest episode of Total Divas.  In case you didn't know...  Miss Money in the Bank has been in a relationship with Big Cass ever since the duo were working together on NXT alongside Enzo Amore. Their relationship had hit a few road bumps over the past few years since Cass was promoted to the main roster without Carmella, back in 2016. Later, Carmella was promoted to the opposite brand to her boyfriend.  The duo seemed as though they were trying to find a way to make their relationship work by finding time together outside of their contracted hours, but Cass's recent knee injury could have been one of the biggest issues that the couple had to overcome.  It was also well-known that the couple bought a house together only a few months ago, which has only added to the shock that the couple have recently decided to end their relationship.  The heart of the matter  On the latest episode of Total Divas, Carmella was finally able to reveal the reasons behind the split between herself and Cass as she sat down with fellow WWE star Natalya and talked about where the couple went wrong.  Carmella talked about how the couple had recently bought a house together and even though that is usually seen as a good sign, it seemed to mean the opposite for their relationship. But there was more to their issues than disagreements about a house, as Carmella revealed that she believed that her long-time boyfriend has no plans to marry her.  His recent knee injury then became a source of problems for the couple as well since Cass's time on the treatment table became a source of negativity for the couple. This apparently went on to impact their relationship.  What's next?  It is being rumoured that Big Cass will be making his return in the Royal Rumble next weekend, whilst his ex-girlfriend is set to make history along with 29 other women as she steps inside the first ever Women's Royal Rumble match.  Author's take  Cass and Carmella were a cute couple on WWE TV for a number of months when they were in NXT, but it seems that WWE is a hard environment to be able to make relationships work. Many couples have had the same issues, but it seems that both stars are now free to concentrate on having memorable wrestling careers instead.	1

"Anyone who's laid eyes on a runway, fashion campaign, movie screen, or beauty counter in the past five or so years knows it: We're living in the Arch Ages. That's right, we've fully embraced bigger, bolder, thicker, more emphatic eyebrows.  Thankfully, and perhaps refreshingly, fashion's obsession with ""thin"" hasn't applied to brows in quite some time. It goes without saying that this trend is largely epitomized by Cara Delevingne, who was attributed with a decrease in tweezer sales last year.  And let's not forget Teen Vogue cover girl Lily Collins, whose bewitching, bushy brows (shown here) have earned her comparisons to one of the trend's true pioneers: Audrey Hepburn."	1

The Met Gala is one of the biggest fashion-focused events of the year.  Although many celebrities enjoy the Met Gala, some have been outspoken about their dislike for it.  Amy Schumer said the event “felt like punishment” in 2016, but went back again in 2017.  Lena Dunham called it a “crazy countdown to escape” even though she would later return to the Met Gala a few more times.  Visit INSIDER’s homepage for more stories.  If you love fashion and famous people, there’s a pretty good chance you wait every year to check out the celebrity-studded Met Gala, which is one of fashion’s most over-the-top spectacles all year long.  Held annually on the first Monday night in May, the Gala, known formally as the Costume Institute Gala, is not just an excuse for the most famous people in the world to wear really fancy outfits -it’s actually a fundraising gala for the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute, and if you want to attend, one ticket costs a reported $30,000.  Supermodels, musicians, and media darlings are all sure to secure a spot at the event, which has a theme each year, often resulting in some pretty wild celebrity moments.  Some celebs have attended the gala only to come out of it saying how unenjoyable the event can be.  Here are five stars who have made some major complaints about the gala.  Amy Schumer said the event “felt like punishment” in 2016, but went back again in 2017.

She went to her first Met Gala when her star was firmly on the rise back in 2016, but she did not have a good time.  Afterward, she told Howard Stern about her experience, saying, “I guess I should be grateful I was invited or something, but yeah, it felt like a punishment. It’s not me and I don’t like it … It’s so fake … It’s people doing an impression of having a conversation.”  Adding insult to injury, she said, “I left not the second I could; I left earlier than I should’ve been allowed,” she added.  However, the best part for Schumer was that she got to meet Beyoncé: “I got to meet Beyoncé and she was like, ‘Is this your first Met?’ and I was like, ‘It’s my last.'”  It seems she had a change of heart, because she was on hand for the 2017 Met Gala.  “I had fun I really did … It’s an intense environment … I had fun inside,” Schumer told E!, speaking about the 2017 Met Gala.  Demi Lovato said she felt awkward at the event.  Foto: Lovato’s infamous photo op at the Met Gala in 2016.sourceDemi Lovato/Instagram  Cameras spotted Lovato in a seemingly awkward photo op with Nicki Minaj and fashion designer Jeremy Scott in 2016. The “Confident” singer posted the hilarious yet cringeworthy photo to her Instagram page, spilling her version of what went down in her caption.  It seems the uncomfortable run-in with Minaj left Lovato less than enthused about the event as a whole. In 2018, she told Billboard, “I had a terrible experience,” sharing that one celebrity, in particular, made her feel so uncomfortable, she nearly relapsed in her sobriety.  She said, “I changed my clothes, but I still had my diamonds on – millions of dollars of diamonds on in an AA meeting. And I related more to the homeless people in that meeting who struggled with the same struggles that I deal with than the people at the Met Gala….”  Gwyneth Paltrow said the event was “so un-fun” in 2013, but went back in 2017.  Foto: Paltrow at the 2013 Met Gala.sourceJamie McCarthy/Getty Images  Paltrow has always been considered a fashion darling, but she also keeps it real about how “un-fun” such a prestigious event is.

    Queen Máxima of the Netherlands is mourning the loss of her sister, Inés Zorreguieta, who died of an apparent suicide at age 33.  Zorreguieta, an Argentina native who worked for the government, was found in her Buenos Aires apartment on Wednesday, June 6, according to BBC.  “It is presumed that it was a suicide,” a Dutch government spokesperson told the Argentinian newspaper La Nacion at the time. Dutch officials told local newspaper De Volkskrant that Queen Máxima is allegedly “shocked and devastated” over news of her sister’s passing. The publication also reported that Inés battled mental health issues and was recently admitted to a psychiatric clinic to treat an eating disorder and depression.  “The sudden death of Queen Máxima’s sister comes as a big shock,” Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte said, per The Guardian, “It is intensely sad and heartbreaking news that can hardly be comprehended by those who stay behind. With our hearts and our thoughts we are with the queen and her family. I wish them all the strength necessary to carry this horrible loss together. And I trust that they will get the peace and space for that.”  The royal has reportedly canceled appearences scheduled for the next 10 days and plans to travel from Holland to Buenos Aires. She seemed to be close to Zorreguieta, who was a bridesmaid in her 2002 wedding to the crown prince, Willem-Alexander. Zorreguieta was also the godmother to their third child, Princess Ariana of the Netherlands, 11.  Inés’s death comes nearly one year after she and Máxima suffered the loss of their father, Jorge Zorreguieta, who died at age 89 in August 2017.  If you or anyone you know needs help, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).	1

    Not on her watch! Mila Kunis is no stranger to the spotlight, but that doesn’t mean she can completely turn the other cheek when it comes to gossip about herself and her family.  The 34-year-old Bad Moms actress opened up about life in the public eye — and how she tries to avoid the rumor mill — for Cosmopolitan magazine’s August cover story published on Monday, July 2.  “I don’t read anything about myself. I genuinely don’t know what’s written about me … other than I know that I’m pregnant about once a year and my husband [Ashton Kutcher] and I are getting a divorce once a year,” she told the mag. “I know this because I go down the grocery store aisle, and I see it on the cover of magazines and I’m like, ‘Oh boy, OK!’”  However, it’s not as easy for those closest to her to know what’s going on behind closed doors, making some fake stories stressful. “The only thing that’s upsetting is my parents and my grandparents sometimes get confused,” she noted before reflecting on one tough time in particular.  “At one point when I was pregnant, [the tabloids] said that I had an emergency and was rushed to the hospital, and my face was on the cover,” Kunis said. “The amount of stress that caused my family, nobody will understand.”  As for one person who’s in the cheering section every time there’s speculation of another little Kutcher? “My dad is always very hopeful that the pregnancies are true,” the Friends With Benefits star dished. “He’s always like, ‘Is there really another?'”  Kunis and Kutcher tied the knot in 2015 and share two kids — daughter Wyatt, 3, and son Dimitri, 1. The pair costarred together from 1998 to 2006 on That ‘70s Show.  For the latest celebrity news and interviews subscribe to our new podcast ‘In Case You Missed Us’ below!  	0

"“The Bachelorette” star Rachel Lindsay is engaged to Bryan Abasolo.  Interested in The Bachelorette? Add The Bachelorette as an interest to stay up to date on the latest The Bachelorette news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest  After weeks of narrowing down her suitors from 31 men, the 32-year-old trial attorney from Dallas chose the 37-year-old Colombian chiropractor living in Miami.  Abasolo had sparks with Lindsay from the very first episode of the show’s latest season, even passionately kissing her before the competition. The bold move not only helped him secure the first impression rose, but also, it seems, solidified a permanent place in Lindsay's heart.  Lindsay chose her fiancé over finalists Peter Kraus, the 31-year-old business owner from Madison, Wisconsin, and Eric Bigger, the 29-year-old Baltimore native.  Big thanks to @therachlindsay for taking me on one of the greatest dates of my life! #thebachelorette A post shared by Dr. Bryan Abasolo (@thebryanabasolo) on Jun 26, 2017 at 7:26pm PDT  The bride-to-be chose Abasolo after a romantic date on a hot air ballon in Spain. It was also after Lindsay had a tearful goodbye with Kraus because he just wasn't ready to propose.  The bachelorette admitted that because of her emotional goodbye to Kraus, who was emphatic about only proposing if he was absolutely sure and not because the show's season finale was set to air, she wasn't as prepared as she could've been at the final rose ceremony.  ""I’ve never been more confused than I have this week,"" she told Abasolo. ""I was trying to find cracks in what seemed like the perfect foundation.""  But Lindsay said she couldn't find any. ""I see my forever,"" she told him. ""I see my future.""  That meant Abasolo was left to do one thing: propose.  ""I am the best version of myself when I'm with you,"" he said. ""You are so easy and effortless to love and I just want to love you for the rest of your life. Will you be my cariña [sweetheart] forever?""  Lindsay jumped up and down, saying yes.  It was clear from the very first episode that Lindsay, the first African-American bachelorette in the 13-season history of the franchise, was serious about finding love.  On the season premiere, she explained why she turned to the reality show to help her find a life partner and husband.  ""I have neglected other areas of my life,"" Lindsay explained. ""It's hard to take off that lawyer hat and put on the other one [to find love].""  Lindsay and Abasolo said they're not rushing to plan a wedding. Right now, ""we just want to bring our lives together,"" the future groom said.  But the two have agreed on one thing: a winter wedding.  “I’m from Texas ... obviously,"" Lindsay said explaining her preference,"" but we’re not rushing anything."""	1

I mean, Chandler is perfect as well.'  She continued: 'I've never heard him swear. He doesn't drink. He's just awesome. He's the kind of man you hope for your daughter, so I think I'm lucky.'  'I've never heard him swear, he doesn't drink, he's just awesome!' Terri Irwin, 54, has revealed why her daughter Bindi's boyfriend Chandler Powell is 'the kind of man you hope for your daughter'  However, when quizzed by the publication on whether a wedding is imminent, Bindi was quick to shut down speculation.  'I promise I'm not engaged yet. I swear when I do get engaged, I will not be that secretive,' she implored.  'Right now, we're enjoying our lives together. I think we forget to revel in the moment and revel in the now,' she said.  Wild love story!

Chandler previously discussed the story of their fateful encounter during an episode of Dancing With The Stars back in 2015.  'I'm a professional wakeboarder.

The teenager added that Chandler loves conservation and wildlife as much as she does, adding that it's helpful he's so strong as he can handle jumping on the crocodiles.	1
Celebrities who treat their significant others like trash  Love isn't easy, but it's a whole lot harder when your significant other treats you like utter trash. Though Hollywood relationships are notoriously short-lived (blame the pressures of fame and red carpet-worthy egos,) some stars are undeniably terrible partners. From Gwyneth Paltrow, who's totally willing to admit she's hard to date, to Chris Brown, who was put on probation for his disturbing crimes against Rihanna, the spectrum of inconsiderate partners is notably vast. There are hundreds of ways to hurt the one you love — and even more if you've got money.  Not every celebrity bad boy (or girl) stays that way, though. Some regretful partners actually do change. Take Adam Levine, for example, who allegedly apologized to his exes before settling down, or Justin Bieber, whose plea for forgiveness infected airwaves in 2015. Then there's John Mayer, who still seems sort of bitter about that one Taylor Swift song (yeah, we're still waiting on the world to change, too.)  If the bad press is true, these celebrities are notoriously inconsiderate partners that you wouldn't want to date.	1

On Tuesday, Jennifer Lawrence wore a black Versace gown to a photo-call in London promoting her latest film, Red Sparrow. Some compared the look to Elizabeth Hurley’s famous 90s Versace gown, while others focused on the amount of skin the actress showed while posing outside next to men in suits. The attention surrounding the dress was more than Lawrence preferred, however, and she took to her Facebook account to address it.  “I don’t really know where to get started on this ‘Jennifer Lawrence wearing a revealing dress in the cold’ controversy. This is not only utterly ridiculous, I am extremely offended,” she wrote on Wednesday. “That Versace dress was fabulous, you think I’m going to cover that gorgeous dress up with a coat and a scarf? I was outside for 5 minutes. I would have stood in the snow for that dress because I love fashion and that was my choice.”  She continued to call the discussions “sexist,” saying they were “creating silly distractions from real issues.”  “Get a grip people,” she finished. “Everything you see me wear is my choice. And if I want to be cold THAT’S MY CHOICE TOO!”  Lawrence has since shifted the focus away from her bare limbs and to the crush she shares with most of the Oscar movie-watching planet, Timothée Chalamet. In an interview with Entertainment Tonight, the actress described the Call Me by Your Name star as both “hot” and “talented.”  “Timothée, I’m waiting for him to get a little bit older, you know?” she said about the Oscar nominee, who at 22 is only five years her junior. “[I’m] buttering him up like a pig for slaughter, and then I’m going to swing right in there as soon as he’s, like, 30.”	0

On Tuesday, the actress posted an Instagram photo of herself and her four-year-old son Finn dressed as 'MC MC MamaBear2B and her DJ CurlyCub.'  Both of them had committed to the look, the 43-year-old wearing a sheer black tank top that showed off her burgeoning baby bump.

In the caption to that photo, her mother painstakingly explained the process of cobbling the whole affair together, noting that both costumes were '#nosew.'

She continued: 'Topped it off with a plastic pink tiara that I hot glued with the pink stuffing bunches and then added a real cotton candy paper cone ( can roll up a paper one too).'

"Michelle Obama has some summer workout motivation for you The former First Lady is keeping up her White House traditions  Michelle Obama may not be in the White House anymore, but she is determined to continue with some of the traditions she established while she was there. The former First Lady has revealed that she still hosts regular ""boot camp weekends"" with her friends like she used to, and took to Instagram to share some photos from their most recent meetup.  GALLERY: See inside Michelle and Barack Obama's new home  Posting a series of snaps of herself and a group of women exercising in the park, Michelle wrote: ""When I was at the White House, I often hosted boot camp weekends for my close girlfriends. It didn't matter that we were all at varying fitness levels. Our boot camp weekends were a reminder that if we want to keep taking care of others, we need to take care of ourselves first. And even though I'm no longer at the White House, I've continued this tradition and wanted to share some photos.""  VIEW GALLERY  Michelle Obama hosted a boot camp weekend for her friends  The mother-of-two continued: ""My girlfriends have been there for me through all kinds of life transitions over the years – including a pretty big one recently! – and we've done our best to stay healthy together. Whether it's a boot camp or a walk around the neighbourhood, I hope you and your crew can find some time this summer to be healthy together.""  Keeping fit and healthy is incredibly important to Michelle, and she previously pioneered the Let's Move! Public health campaign to aim to reduce childhood obesity and encourage a healthy lifestyle in children. The 53-year-old said she always wants to be in the best health she can possibly be, telling Prevention: ""I always want to be on the cusp of being in the best shape that I can be. What I'm discovering is that the older you get, the more work you have to do to stay there. When I was younger, I could eat whatever I wanted, as long as I exercised; or if I didn't exercise and just watched what I ate, I'd maintain. Well, now I have to do both.""  VIEW GALLERY  The former First Lady wants to maintain her White House traditions  Michelle also revealed how she had changed her workouts over time. ""I'm varying my workouts so it's not just cardio but also includes moves to maintain my flexibility,"" she explained. ""I incorporated Pilates and do much more stretching.""

's legacy lives on in her son and his new wife.  Back in England after their first royal tour of Ireland together, Prince Harry and Duchess of Sussex kicked off their latest public engagement on Tuesday at the Centenary Exhibition set up at the Queen Elizabeth Hall in the Southbank Center. It was a special visit as the couple had the opportunity to meet several prominent figures connected to the late South African president, including his granddaughter Zamaswazi Dlamini-Mandela.  22 years earlier, Harry's beloved mother met with Zamaswazi's famed grandfather in South Africa just five months before her death. Whether unintentional or otherwise, Markle even seemed to channel the former Princess of Wales sartorially, donning a sleeveless double-breasted blush trench dress by Canadian label, NONIE—a modern version of the button-down dress Diana opted for all those years ago. It appears both women had buttons in mind for the occasions.	1

"Couric is returning to NBC for another Olympics. USATSI  Katie Couric will be back on NBC after the network announced that she will be joining Mike Tirico in the booth on Feb. 9 for Pyeongchang's Opening Ceremony for the 2018 Winter Olympics. The announcement was made by Jim Bell, NBC's president of Olympics production and programming, on Wednesday.  The ceremony, which will air at 8 p.m. ET on Feb. 9, will be held at Pyeongchang Olympic Stadium in South Korea. NBC also announced that, for the first time, fans will be able to stream the ceremony live.  Couric explained her return to the booth.  ""During my years at NBC, I loved covering the Olympics and showcasing the hard work, dedication and perseverance of athletes from around the world,"" she said, via Deadline. ""The Opening Ceremony will be a chance for South Korea to share its culture and customs and for the international community to celebrate this unparalleled display of athletic achievement and sportsmanship. There's nothing quite like it. I'm also looking forward to working with [Tirico], who brings a wealth of knowledge and passion to everything he does.""  Couric will also interview athletes and provide coverage for NBC throughout the Winter Olympics.  This will be Tirico's first Opening Ceremony, which is a far cry from Couric's experience of three ceremonies. However, Tirico has been preparing for the event for over a year, whereas Couric only just found out she'd be co-hosting.  ""I've been paying attention to a lot of the things that've been going on in the world,"" Couric said, via CNN. ""Some of the athletes of course I know, but luckily I'm a quick study and a fast learner and hopefully I'll have everything under my belt."""	1
"When it emerged he had signed on to star in a prequel to Jason Statham's Transporter series many assumed he had turned his back Game Of Thrones.  But Ed Skrein has finally spoken out to say he would never have walked away from the plum role of Daario Naharis, and instead insisted 'politics' was behind his abrupt exit from the show.  The 32-year-old English actor gave a love it or loath it performance as the cocksure lieutenant of mercenary group the Second Sons, who ends up killing his fellow commanders to win the affection of Daenerys Targaryen, that still lives in the memory of fans.  Scroll down for video  Politicking: Ed Skrein has insisted he left his plum role on Game Of Thrones due to behind the scenes intrigue  He told TooFab: 'Contrary to reports I didn’t walk away. I wouldn’t walk away. There are very few things in my life I’ve walked away from.  'This is a complicated industry and there’s always politics involved.'  However while he still seems disappointed about having to have left such a plum role after just three episodes, he insists he does not wonder about how things could have been different.  The rapper-turned-actor said: 'I never really look back, my journey has been unorthodox in many ways.  Un-Ed-iftying: After he lost his role as Daario Naharis it was given to the bland Dutch actor Michiel Huisman  'All I do is count my blessings and try to be as present as I can and I’m thankful for every step of this journey.'  Wise words indeed from the jolly cockney, who went by the rather questionable moniker of The Dinnerlady P.I.M.P. during his hip hop career.  While Ed's role was filled by the bland Michiel Huisman, Ed finds himself filling someone's shoes himself in Transporter Refueled, which hits screens on Friday.  The statuesque actor plays a younger version of dinky star Jason Statham's hardman chauffeur Frank Martin in the film, which sees the character face-off against some Eastern European gangsters.  Bald ambition: He is filling the shoes of follicly challenged action icon Jason Statham in Transporter Refueled  However he insists he felt no pressure taking over from the follicly challenged action icon, saying: 'It wasn't really daunting it all The daunting part for me, the pressure was from the inside.  'I want to make work that I’m proud of and that fulfills me creatively, that’s where the pressure came from.'  While it is unlikely his hairier rendition of the action character is unlikely to garner much critical acclaim, he stands a greater chance of winning some attention when he plays the villain Ajax in hotly-tipped 20th Century Fox Marvel spinoff Deadpool.  He said he had a great time getting physical with the film's star Ryan Reynolds, who plays the titular fast-talking mercenary character with a sick sense of humour.  Original and best: It is unlikely Ed will win over fans of Jason's popular portrayal of the hardman chauffeur  Ed said: 'Me and Ryan had incredible chemistry, we had this synergy. A lot of time, they don’t want to pair actors together, especially leads because we’re not stunt guys.  'We may make a mistake and if we make a mistake and break each others’ noses or knock a tooth out. It's a lot of money and jobs on the line.  I was like to (the director), ""Get me in there, put me in, I’ve done all this training, I’m ready.  'They were hesitant [but] I went straight in and we had a great synergy and we stayed the two of us for the whole day and I remember Ryan saying to me, ""I’ve had such a great time getting beat up by you,"" and vice versa.'"	0
"There's good news for former ""Bachelorette"" Emily Maynard and husband Tyler Johnson — and it's familiar news: They're expecting a baby!  Just last year, the couple, who married in 2014, made a similar announcement. Now, eight months after welcoming a baby boy named Jennings, there's another bundle of joy on the way.  ""Some might say I’m crazy. Some might call me a glutton for punishment. I’d say I’m a little bit of both,"" Maynard wrote in a blog post for People.com.

But unexpected or not, she and Johnson couldn't be happier about their growing family.  ""I said about two weeks after Jennings was born that I couldn’t wait to have another,"" Maynard explained. ""I just had no clue it would happen so quickly! Some of my closest friends have had a really hard time getting pregnant and my heart breaks for them, so I’m just so grateful for this blessing God has given our family.""  This will be the third child for Maynard, who also has a 10-year-old daughter, Ricki, from her relationship with late NASCAR driver Ricky Hendrick.  So much has changed in Maynard's life over the past few years. In 2011, she received the final rose from Brad Womack on Season 15 of ""The Bachelor."" But months after the finale, they parted ways.

"If you're a Teen Mom: OG fan, then by now, you've probably heard the news that Amber Portwood and Matt Baier have broken up.  Fans have been hoping these two would part ways pretty much from the day they went public with their relationship, and now that Amber has a new boyfriend, it seems it's safe to say she and Matt are well and truly over.  But while TMOG viewers may be thrilled by the split, Matt is most definitely not.  The newly single Baier opened up about his split from Amber in a recent interview with E! News:  ""I'm trying to do a lot of work on myself because I realize now the downfall of our relationship was my fault,"" he explained.  ""When you're thrust into the spotlight like that, it can affect you. My mistake was taking our relationship for granted.""  Baier says the high-profile nature of the relationship was part of the problem (which is odd, because he never would have met Amber if she weren't on TV), but he also accepts responsibility for being a less-than-stellar partner:  ""What I've learned from this is you have to do the work,"" he told the outlet.  ""You have to make the person you're with feel loved every single day. I forgot to do that and now I'm paying the price.""  Matt says he's full of regrets over the way his relationship played out, and if given a second chance, he would change everything about the way he behaved.  ""If I got a do-over,"" he said, ""I would do everything differently. I should have listened to her more.""  The couple was filming a new season of the We TV reality series Marriage Boot Camp at the time of their split.  Matt left the set ahead of schedule and took off for Vegas - where he's apparently been living ever since.  ""I went to Vegas to get my head around the split. Ultimately, my hope was to get a place where Amber could come visit me and we could work on our issues. Obviously, that didn't happen.""  But despite the fact that Amber is in a new relationship, Matt is still hopeful that she'll find her way back to him:  ""I'll hold out hope for a reconciliation. But if nothing else, I hope we can stay friends,"" Baier says.  ""We started off as best friends and that's what I miss the most from her—her friendship. To not have that is painful. When something happens, my natural instinct still is to call her and tell her everything. She was my family.""  As though that's not depressing enough, Baier concluded the info with some insights into his day-to-day life post-Amber:  ""I've been making a living through my [poker] winnings,"" he says.  ""That said, I'm not really enjoying it. This isn't the life I want to live.""  Yeesh. Matt may not have been the perfect boyfriend, but here's hoping he's able to pull himself out of what sounds like a pretty considerable funk.  Watch Teen Mom: OG online to relive Matt and Amber's tumultuous relationship."	1

"Tibrina Hobson/Getty  Demi Lovato threw quite the rager for her ""Sorry Not Sorry"" music video, and her party guests included several famous faces: Wiz Khalifa, Paris Hilton, and Jamie Foxx. This may seem like an unexpected group of celebrities, but nothing brings people together like neon lights, a kiddie-pool bubble bath, and a dance floor.  ""I wanted random people in my video,"" Lovato told MTV News correspondent Gaby Wilson this week, ahead of her VMA performance on Sunday. ""I wanted people to be like, what? Like, I wanted Bill Nye the Science Guy to be in it too, but I don't think he was available. Too cool for my video.""  Yep, that's right: Demi wanted to turn up with your childhood science teacher, but because she couldn't, she recruited the other celeb cameos via text messages. ""I thought Paris would be, like, awesome to be the DJ,"" Lovato explained. ""Wiz is a friend of mine — we go to the same gym — and then Jamie Foxx, I had just been over to his house for a party. And so I was like, I'd love for you to be in my video, and he is so freakin' funny, so having him in it was a blast.""  The party continues this weekend in Las Vegas, where Demi will belt out ""Sorry Not Sorry"" before DNCE take the stage with the legendary Sir Rod Stewart for a remote performance during the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards.

Rap savant Kanye West can be, shall we say, a little temperamental sometimes. And he is particularly sensitive about how his wife, Kim Kardashian, is perceived and treated.  That said, Yeezy has had enough off the “stiff-arm” treatment that Kardashian has received from music royalty Beyoncé and, to a lesser extent, her husband Jay-Z. More specifically, according to Celebrity Insider, West is irate by the lack of respect that his former friends have for his wife.  An insider told the publication that Kanye goes “nuts” thinking about the fact that Queen Bey feels that she is far more talented and is superior to Kardashian.  This issue is really coming to light now because of the fact that Bey and Jay skipped out on Kanye and Kim K.’s wedding a few years ago – even though their names were engraved into their designated table — yet Beyoncé was able to go to Serena Williams’ wedding recently.  The source stated, “It drives Kanye insane that Beyoncé treats Kim like she is inferior and not worthy of her friendship; it infuriates him. Kanye is fiercely protective of his family and feels that by dissing Kim, he is being dissed, too.”  The family friend said West, contrary to many people, is proud of Kardashian’s accomplishments and wished Jay-Z and Beyoncé would recognize that she is a great mother and businesswoman.  The person elaborates: “As far as Kanye is concerned, Beyoncé has no right to look down her nose at Kim, sure she is a reality TV star, but she is also a wildly successful businesswoman and a self-made multi-millionaire.”  It has gotten to the point where West will only accept Jay and Bey’s friendship if they are more accommodating to his wife.  “The way Beyoncé has been toward Kim is a bone of contention for Kanye, and when it comes to any future relationship with Jay-Z, it is a real sticking point,” the insider says. “Kanye feels that unless Beyoncé and Jay-Z are willing to treat his wife with respect, he believes she deserves then he has no desire to make nice with either of them.”  Another insider told Celebrity Insider that is not about to happen anytime soon. The music superstar does not think much of the reality star and socialite.  On top of that, it was widely speculated a few years ago that Beyoncé was very wary of Kardashian’s intentions, believing that Kim K. was trying to use Queen Bey to gain even wider fame, acceptability and respectability — which is why some people think she really wanted Beyoncé at her and Kanye’s wedding.  “Beyonce has never gelled with Kim, she just doesn’t respect her, or like her, she never has, even before Kim got with Kanye,” the source said. “Beyonce cannot stand the whole reality TV thing, and she thinks Kim would do anything for fame. She just feels they are two different people with nothing in common. Beyonce is always polite to Kim when she sees her, but you can tell it is forced and that there’s no warmth or genuineness in her interactions.”	0
"American actress and singer  Jamie Lynn Marie Spears[1] (born April 4, 1991) is an American singer and actress. She was born in McComb, Mississippi, and raised in Louisiana. She is the younger sister of singer Britney Spears. She is known for her role as Zoey Brooks on the Nickelodeon teen sitcom Zoey 101, in which she starred from 2005 to 2008. In July 2019, Netflix announced that Spears has been cast as a series regular in the upcoming romance drama series Sweet Magnolias.[3]  Spears became the subject of significant media attention and controversy in 2007, when she announced she was pregnant at age 16, effectively sending her career into hiatus. In 2013, Spears launched a career in country music. She released her debut single, ""How Could I Want More"", along with her debut EP, The Journey.  Early life [ edit ]  Spears was born in McComb, Mississippi, to James and Lynne Spears. Her older siblings are Bryan and Britney.[4] She attended Parklane Academy, where she was a cheerleader, and point guard of the basketball team.[5] Spears studied with tutors while filming Zoey 101 in Los Angeles.[6] She finished her education via online correspondence[7] and received her GED in February 2008 through Tangipahoa Parish School System Adult Education Center.[8]  Career [ edit ]  In February 2002, Spears made her acting debut in the Paramount Pictures drama film Crossroads which starred her sister, who portrayed the central character Lucy Wagner. Spears made a cameo, playing the younger version of Britney's character.[9] Following Crossroads, Nickelodeon cast Spears as a regular performer in the eighth season of the sketch comedy series All That.[10] The season followed a two-year hiatus of the series. Spears portrayed various roles through the two seasons she appeared in as well as herself. Spears's performance received positive reviews from critics with many complimenting her comedic timing and being a highlight of the show. Spears did not return for the series' tenth and final season to pursue other roles on the network. Spears made a guest appearance at Stars, Stripes and Skates skating gala at Madison Square Garden in September 2002.[11]  In August 2004, Spears signed a development deal with Nickelodeon in which she would star as the protagonist in her own scripted television series that would air on the network. The series went on to be titled Zoey 101 and Spears portrayed the role of Zoey Brooks. The series centered on Zoey and her friends who attend a fictional boarding school, Pacific Coast Academy (PCA).

The series finale, ""PCA Confidential"", aired on May 2, 2008. Nickelodeon issued a statement shortly after the announcement of Spears being pregnant at the age of 16 stating that the network respected Spears's decision to take responsibility and noting that its primary concern was for her well-being.[13][14]  In December 2007, Variety announced Spears had signed on to guest appear in the ABC comedy sitcom series Miss Guided, in which she played the role of the promiscuous high school student Mandy Fener in the episode ""Hot Sub"" which aired on March 20, 2008. That same year Spears voiced the role of Goldilocks in the direct-to-DVD animation film Unstable Fables: Goldilocks & 3 Bears Show.

Guillermo del Toro. Photo: Kevin Winter/Getty Images  When Natalie Portman introduced the Best Director candidates at the Golden Globes as the “all-male nominees,” it inspired a bit of controversy. Onscreen, it appeared as if the directors — Martin McDonagh, Christopher Nolan, Ridley Scott, Steven Spielberg, and Guillermo del Toro — might have been a bit miffed. However, you can at least consider the smiling eye roll that del Toro gave to the camera to be a sheepish reaction instead of an offended one. The Shape of Water filmmaker and Globe recipient for Best Director told IndieWire that he approves of Portman’s comment, “I think it was great! She should say exactly what she feels. There is phenomenal work being done by female directors.” He then cited three films that were helmed by women directors in 2017 that could have also received award nods. “Mudbound, Lady Bird, and Wonder Woman are all terrific,” he said.  If this year’s Oscars are anything like the Golden Globes, hopefully del Toro will pass on the memo to his rivals. For what it’s worth, Spielberg doesn’t believe women will be shut out of the upcoming Academy Awards Oscars.	1
"Warning: Spoiler alert! Do not proceed if you haven't watched Tuesday's episode of This Is Us. You have been warned...  It's This Is Us vs. Crock-Pot.  Tuesday's gut-wrenching episode revealed the unexpected cause of the fire that burned down the Pearson family home and presumably brought Jack to his demise: an ill-functioning Crock-Pot that was given as a present to a young Jack and Rebecca by an elderly neighbor named George. ""You have to fiddle with the switch a little, but it works,"" he assured the couple. So when the switch randomly turned on in the middle of the night years later, it sparked a fire in the kitchen that quickly spread throughout the home. If only the smoke detector had working batteries...  Following the episode, fans were devastated over the fact that a simple Crock-Pot could have been the cause of Jack's death, some even decrying the use of their own slow cookers. On Wednesday, the Crock-Pot company responded on social media -- even creating a new hashtag on Twitter, #CrockPotIsInnocent -- to fans yearning for answers.  ""Jack Pearson was our Valentine so we equally understand your pain with his loss. We love him and we love you too ❤,"" the company wrote on its Facebook page in response to a fan seeking a statement over people throwing away their slow cookers. ""Don’t further add to our heartbreak by no longer using Crock-Pot Slow Cookers, rest assured our products have been generationally tested by your family and friends.""  Crock Pot Facebook page  The company also replied to another fan who stated that people were ""worried"" about the safety of their Crock-Pots.  ""We’re heartbroken over last night’s episode, too!"" the company replied, adding, ""We’re innocent until proven guilty. Since the 1970s we have been providing families with quality and safe products, ask your parents if you don’t believe us.""  Crock Pot Facebook page  Well then, Crock-Pot. If you say so!  This Is Us creator Dan Fogelman felt the need to defend the existence of slow cookers, taking to Twitter early Wednesday morning to ""remind"" viewers that what they saw last night wasn't real life. (But it sure felt like it, didn't it?)  ""Taking a moment to remind everyone that it was a 20 year old fictional crockpot with an already funky switch? Let's not just lump all those lovely hardworking crockpots together,"" Fogelman wrote.  Taking a moment to remind everyone that it was a 20 year old fictional crockpot with an already funky switch?

    The basketball world was shaken on Sunday, July 1, with the news that LeBron James had agreed to a four-year, $153.3 million deal with the Los Angeles Lakers.  The Cavaliers forward declined to exercise his $35.6 million 2018-2019 player option and became an unrestricted free agent on Friday, June 29, and reportedly fielded offers from the Cavaliers, Rockets and 76ers before going with the Lakers.

"It seems Blake Shelton may have a thing or two to learn about karma himself.  Last week, Shelton caused an uproar when he sent a cryptic tweet about ""karma"" just as reports claimed that his ex-wife Miranda Lambert was dating a married man.  ""Been taking the high road for a long time.. I almost gave up. But I can finally see something on the horizon up there!! Wait!! Could it be?! Yep!! It’s karma!!"" Shelton tweeted after multiple outlets reported Lambert began dating married Turnpike Troubadours front man, Evan Felker.  But according to Lambert's ex-boyfriend Jeff Allen, Shelton is not as innocent as he's trying to seem.  Allen tweeted and deleted a post calling out Shelton for romancing Allen's then-girlfriend Lambert while Shelton was still married to his first wife, Kaynette Williams, in 2006.  ""You know, I’ve always given you the benefit of the doubt and chalked it up to just being human, but you must be one arrogant SOB to pop off something like this, when I know damn good and well you were cheating on your wife and Miranda was cheating on me when you two started up,"" Allen wrote in a since-deleted tweet, according to Us Weekly.  ""I kept my mouth shut for 13 years. Sorry, his karma tweet rubbed me wrong. All of this is pointless,"" he added.  Allen told RadarOnline.com, ""I’m sure Miranda did [Blake] dirty just like she did me, but he wasn’t thinking about me when he was cheating with her, so I don’t know why he thinks it's karma.""  He added that he does not harbor bad feelings toward Lambert and said she ""was a loving, caring person and a good girlfriend.""  Reps for Lambert and Shelton did not return Fox News' requests for comment.  It's been reported that Lambert and Shelton's romance began as an affair but both singers have denied this in the past. They became engaged in May 2010 and married a year later in Texas. The country singers announced their divorce after four years of marriage in July 2015.  The ""Tin Man"" singer, who recently ended things with her boyfriend of two years, Anderson East, reportedly began seeing Felker when his band joined Lambert's ""Livin’ Like Hippies"" tour in January.  Felker married global strategist Staci Nelson in September 2016. The singer filed for divorce on Feb. 16 while Nelson filed 12 days later.  Nelson, who still goes by her married name on social media, shared a tearful selfie on Thursday with the caption, ""PSA: If Staci Felker can make it through this week, so can you."""	0
Danica Patrick hosted the 2018 ESPYS on Wednesday night in Los Angeles, opening the show with a seven-minute monologue that received mixed reviews from the internet.  She nailed several jokes, but her comedic timing was a little off on others and led to a few awkward moments. And it probably didn’t help that the audience didn’t seem settled in their seats and fully into the routine.  Prior to the show, Patrick told For The Win she prepped by practicing her monologue to ensure the jokes were delivered in her voice. She took plenty of shots at other athletes — including LeBron James, Tiger Woods and the U.S. men’s soccer team — and said that when she was often the target of jokes, she took it as a compliment because she was “important enough” to be thought of.  “I loved the creative process and coming up with ideas and jokes and putting in my two cents there, along with the help of a dozen highly qualified writers,” Patrick told FTW by phone Saturday.  So because there were some highs and lows at the show, here are Patrick’s best and worst jokes.  The Best  1. A topical joke, for the win  “The Caps won their first Stanley Cup in franchise history. And Alex Ovechkin couldn’t be any happier. I haven’t seen a Russian this pleased with Washington since, well, two days ago.”  2. Tiger back?  Through the self-deprecating humor Patrick promised, she took a shot at Tiger Woods and herself — but also her trolls on social media who constantly questioned why people cared about her NASCAR and IndyCar careers when she only won one race in 14 years on the track.  “Tiger Woods is back. Sort of I guess. I mean, why do people keep talking about this guy who isn’t winning? Who does he think he is? Me?”  3. Sorry, Cleveland  “No matter what else is going on in the world, sports have always had the power to inspire and give hope… unless those people are from Cleveland.”  4. Another punch  Following an awkward joke about LeBron James’ hair (see below in The Worst), Danica made a great joke about poor J.R. Smith not knowing what the score was during Game 1 of the NBA Finals.  “That’s OK. LeBron, when he hosted, he made fun of me too. I’d say we’re even. J.R. Smith would say we’re up by one!”  That one was met with heavy applause. And she continued…  “Yeah, he made quite the little oopsie in the playoffs this year. You know, it’s not good when you have 100 tattoos and none of them are your biggest mistake.”  5. Keeping Up with the Kardashians  Philadelphia 76s star Ben Simmons is reportedly dating Kendall Jenner, so who could resist an easy target?  “So many big NBA moves this offseason. Kawhi Leonard went to the Raptors, Dwight Howard went to the Wizards and Ben Simmons went to the Kardashians.”  6. Adam Rippon’s Instagram stardom  While highlighting the amazing performances by Team USA in the 2018 Winter Olympics, Patrick said:  “Our gold-medal winning women’s hockey team is here, gold medalist Chloe Kim is here and Instagram’s Adam Rippon is here… I’m told he also won a medal.”  Cut to Rippon — who won a figure skating bronze medal in South Korea — who was hilariously posing like he would for his Instagram account, which is spectacularly entertaining. He stole the show briefly with this joke, but it was cute all around.  7. A short joke  Danica is only about 5-foot-2, so she doesn’t have much of a leg to stand on here when teasing Houston Astros’ All-Star second baseman José Altuve. But as someone who’s in the same height range, this writer always appreciates short jokes.  “World Series champion José Altuve is here. And when I say it’s incredible that José can reach the top of his profession without being able to reach the top shelf of his locker, it’s out of respect.”  The Worst  1. It started off fine…  Patrick threw a jab at the NFL’s new policy that players must stand for the national anthem if they’re on the field, which the players themselves found ridiculous and pointed out how it still misses the point of the peaceful protests. But then the	1
George Clooney was the world’s highest-paid actor in the last year, according to Forbes.  Clooney took home an industry-leading pre-tax paycheck of $239 million in the calendar year between June 1, 2017 and June 1, 2018, Forbes reported.

He was followed on Forbes’ list by Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson, Robert Downey Jr., and seven other actors.  Forbes said that its pre-tax earnings estimates are “based on data from Nielsen, ComScore, Box Office Mojo and IMDB, as well as interviews with industry insiders.”  Here are the ten highest-paid actors in the world, according to Forbes:  Lees ook op Business Insider De rente zou ruim 1,5% hoger zijn zonder de geldmachine van de ECB: ofwel minder pijn voor Nederlandse spaarders én geen korting op je pensioen  10.

Childhood pal Ninaki Priddy opened up about Prince Harry's fiancée, claiming her desire to be famous outweighed her commitment to her marriage to film producer Trevor Engelson.  Meghan married her ex back in 2011 on a Jamaican beach. They split two years later after she landed her role in Suits, which filmed in Toronto. Previously it was thought the pair grew apart after Meghan spent months filming in Canada and her beau was based in LA.  Ninaki says otherwise.  (Image: Getty Images North America)  (Image: REX/Shutterstock)  ""The way she handled it, Trevor definitely had the rug pulled out from under him. He was hurt,"" she said, explaining that while Trevor was heartbroken, Meghan was less affected,"" she told Mail Online.  Prior to their split, Ninaki - who was maid of honour at the wedding - said the pair doted on each other and Trevor would have done anything for the actress.  ""Then, after the wedding, it was like a light switched off. There’s Meghan before fame and Meghan after fame. After three seasons of Suits, she called me to say the marriage was over.  The pair first met aged two at Hollywood’s private Little Red School House before they went to the Immaculate Heart girls’ high school in Los Angeles at the age of 11.  Following a close friendship that she describes as 'sisterly', Ninaki says the pair eventually fell out over how Meghan and ex-husband - who the ex Suits star met when she was just 23 - split.  She explains she went to visit Trevor who was heartbroken over their split, while Meghan seemed less affected.  (Image: Instagram)  Elsewhere, Ninaki said her former best friend, who quit Suits to pursue a life with Harry, always wanted to be famous.

""We used to imagine her receiving an Oscar. She used to practise announcing herself.""  While talking about her relationship with Harry and her role as a future royal, Ninaki claims Meghan was always very aware of the Royal Family - despite the actress claiming she knew little about Harry when they met.  ""I think it’s a very fanciful dream to believe that you just walk into a Prince Charming.  ""I know the Royal Family was something she found fascinating. She had one of Princess Diana’s books [Diana: Her True Story] on her bookshelf, and even when she was with Trevor she told me she wanted to go and stay in London for at least a month.""  She added: ""I wasn’t shocked or even surprised to hear about Prince Harry. I know she used to love The Princess Diaries — films about a commoner who becomes part of a Royal Family. She was very taken with that idea."""	0
"Thanks to the rise of social media, we can now rest assured that stars indeed are just like us. They go to the grocery store! They drink wine on a weeknight! They post (too many) Snapchat videos with the dog filter! The most surprising thing we’ve learned about the hallowed Hollywood elite through social media, however, is that they too struggle with the life annoyances that are dark circles and under-eye bags. Take a look at Rosie Huntington-Whiteley’s Snapchat, for instance, and you’ll see the pillowy-lipped model walk viewers through her entire makeup regimen, starting with a bare face. Sure, her “dark circles” may be an entirely different league than our own (hers are barely discernible while ours may resemble craters on the moon), but that doesn’t mean we’re any less attentive when she shares the concealer she swears by to conceal them. (It’s Nars Radiant Creamy Concealer, $29, by the way.)  With that in mind, we scoured the internet to see what other dark-circle cures celebrities swear by. Because if Selena Gomez says an eye cream really works, and we’re staring at her bright-eyed visage on the red carpet, who are we to deny our faces the same opportunity? From frozen spoons to miracle eye creams, see the under-eye cures Selena, Kate, and more swear by below!  Mike Pont/Getty  Our contributor Lindsay Ellingson broke down her entire in-flight beauty routine for us, and it was glorious. The one thing she never travels without? Klorane’s Smoothing & Relaxing Patches ($18), which tighten and brighten the under-eye area in just a few minutes. She's also a fan of the gold foil eye masks from her own brand, Wander Beauty, especially for their innovative technology. ""Similar to a space blanket that you see at the end of a marathon, the gold foil works with the warmth of your body to retain heat,"" she says. ""When your skin is warm, like when you step outside of a hot shower, you’re able to absorb the maximum amount of serum.""  Wander Beauty Baggage Claim Gold Eye Masks $25 Shop  Amanda Edwards/Getty  The glowy-skinned Gabrielle Union has a less traditional hack for getting rid of dark circles and puffiness. “I chill some tea bags—right now it’s Lipton—and use them on my under-eye,” she tells NYTimes.com. She’s onto something: the caffeine, tannins, and antioxidants naturally found in tea can tighten and soothe the under-eye area.  Lipton Black Tea Bags $10 Shop  Ron Adar/Getty  If you have sensitive eyes, take a cue from Whitney Port and count frozen spoons as your (eye) saviors. “My eyes are very sensitive, so I put spoons in the freezer and then place the frozen spoons on my eyes when they’re irritated or when I’m tired,” she tells TheBeautyBean.com.  Paul Zimmermann/Getty  Our immediate reaction when Kate Hudson Snapchatted a selfie of herself wearing “electro-shock” eye patches—white, wired patches that wrapped around her ears and hung from a plug—was confusion, then a ravenous desire to find out exactly what they are. Turns out they’re something called electric eye patches, which contain hyaluronic acid, collagen, and other plumping ingredients. “The patch is applied to your skin and connected to an electrode to deliver heat energy to the underlying tissues and provide feedback to the device regarding skin temperature,” Jessica Weiser, MD, tells People. (The WrinkleMD Hyaluronic Acid Deep Infusion System, $200, is one if you want to check it out.)  WrinkleMD Wrinklemd Eye Ha Deep Infusion System $199 Shop  Frazer Harrison/Getty  Selena Gomez spilled her beauty secrets to Into the Gloss and revealed the eye cream she calls her holy grail: First Aid Beauty’s Eye Duty Triple Remedy ($36). “If you get dark circles, it’s the sh*t,” she says. She says she’ll put it on, and it feels “all good and cold,” and then she’ll have a coffee to finish up her wake-up process.

"Investor, former 'Property Wars' star sentenced to 17 years for fraud  A former real-estate investor and ""Property Wars"" star was sentenced to 17 years in prison for involvement in multiple fraud schemes that targeted more than 200 victims and resulted in more than $30 million in losses, the U.S. Attorney's Office in Arizona said Tuesday.  Scott Menaged, 40, had previously pleaded guilty to bank fraud, money laundering and aggravated identity theft, the office said.  Menaged operated a real-estate investment business and retail furniture stores in Phoenix, the office said.  He had also appeared on the Discovery Channel's ""Property Wars.""  Embezzled money supported 'lavish lifestyle'  The office said Menaged embezzled millions of dollars in loans meant for real-estate purchases, provided fake real-estate purchase documents to conceal the fraud, and used the embezzled money to support a ""lavish lifestyle"" including travel, million-dollar homes and luxury vehicles.  Once Menaged no longer had access to the embezzled funds, the office said, he orchestrated an ""elaborate identity theft scheme"" with purported customers of his furniture stores.  Menaged used names and personal identification information of recently deceased individuals and used their information to submit fake credit application from his furniture stores to various banks, the office said.  The office said no real furniture purchases ever took place and the ID theft resulted in more than $2 million in losses to the banks.  'Fitting punishment'  “Menaged engaged in a multi-year fraud scheme and brazenly stole from his victims — their money, their identities, and ultimately their trust,” First Assistant U.S. Attorney Elizabeth A. Strange said in a prepared statement. “Today’s lengthy sentence is a fitting punishment for his egregious crimes.”  U.S. District Judge G. Murray Snow also ordered Menaged to pay victims more than $33.5 million in restitution.  The investigation was conducted by the Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations and Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation.

"Dierks Bentley and Cassidy Black first met in eighth grade at Ingleside Middle School in Phoenix, Ariz. The country crooner fell hard but admits he ""wasn't cool enough"" yet for his future wife.  ""I was way too immature and into drinking beer and guns and blowing things up,"" he tells People.  Black sums it up nicely: ""He was just trouble.""  They tried dating in high school but soon were separated by distance, with Bentley moving to Nashville at 19 years of age and Black working at an advertising firm in San Francisco, Calif. Still, Bentley's romantic heart beat loudly, and he wrote her ""crazy love letters"" sent via FedEx.  ""That's why I married her! I was worried I'd get blackmailed with those letters!"" Bentley says with a laugh.  ""I did save them and thought I could always sell them on eBay!"" adds Black.  A little while later, Black came to a show in Las Vegas, Nev., and when she walked onto the tour bus, Bentley knew she was the one he would spend his life with, for better or for worse. They were engaged in December of 2005, and the morning post-proposal, Bentley announced he had another trick up his sleeve: They were to elope in Mexico that day.  ""We got married in a little chapel in Mexico, and it was beautiful and private and real,"" says Black.  Fast forward to more than a decade of marriage, three kids and countless memories later, and Bentley and Black are still going strong."	1

It won the Video of the Year award at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards, receiving three other nominations. A vertical video, directed by Sam Lecca, was released on November 10, 2017, on her official Vevo account.[7] The clip shows the singer and several dancers in the New York City Subway.[8] The clip was previously a Spotify exclusive.[9]  Cabello performed ""Havana"" at several award shows, including the 2017 MTV Europe Music Awards, 2018 iHeartRadio Music Awards, and 2018 Billboard Music Awards. In September 2018, Cabello released a live version of the song featuring her solo performance.[10][11][12] The live version of the song would later be nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Pop Solo Performance at the 61st Annual Grammy Awards.[13] It was the best-selling digital single of 2018 according to International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI), with equivalent sales of 19 million units worldwide.[14][15]  Composition [ edit ]  ""Havana"" is a salsa-inspired[16] mid-tempo pop track, on which Cabello embraces her Cuban heritage.[17] Cabello sings the chorus over Latin-influenced piano riffs and rhythm, with the melody's chord progression constantly switching between Gm—E♭—D 7 and Gm—E♭maj 7 —D 7 .[18][19] Sadie Bell of Billboard interpreted the line ""Half of my heart is in Havana"" as the song chronicling ""a romance that found Cabello's heart left down south,""[20] while for Rolling Stone's Brittany Spanos said that in the ""clubby, smooth"" track, Cabello falls in love with ""a mysterious suitor from East Atlanta"", though she has left her heart in her hometown.[21] Young Thug performs a sing-song verse over the ""bouncy"" piano.[20][22] Rap-Up described the song as a ""Latin fusion"",[23] and XXL called it a ""straightforward pop track"".[22] The second verse featuring Young Thug is replaced with the original lyrics sung by Cabello.[24][failed verification]  Critical reception [ edit ]  Jamieson Cox of Pitchfork regarded the ""sultry, salsa-inflected"" song as a ""keystone for a superstar origin story.""[16] Writing for Billboard, Sadie Bell said that the ""sexy"" track radiates a ""Latin flare"".[20] Similarly, Much's Allison Bowsher opined the track ""arrives just in time to keep the summer heat going on the radio.""[25] Raise Bruner of Time wrote that ""Havana"" ""hits a freshly sultry note that we hope to see more of in her debut album.""[26] Peter Berry of XXL felt that Young Thug's verse ""blends with the bouncy piano perfectly.""[22] Billboard considered it the 19th best song released in 2017, with Lyndsey Havens writing that the song ""didn't arrive like a breakthrough hit, but it ended up changing the entire course"" of Cabello's solo career, as she ""sheds the weight that came with trying to prove herself outside of her former girl group and clears a path to finally be herself.""[27] Popjustice ranked it 19th,[28] while The Fader ranked it 48th.[29] Stephen Kearse of Complex,"	1
It’s been a year full of unexpected voting decisions, but even the hardiest of souls was likely unprepared for People magazine to announce that the “Sexiest Man” of 2017 is … Blake Shelton.  That’s right. Blake Shelton: country singer, Voice judge, boyfriend of Gwen Stefani, and frequent purveyor of weird gay panic, misogyny, and Islamophobia.  If naming Shelton was a publicity stunt, it worked: Twitter users were so startled by the revelation that both “Blake Shelton” and “Sexiest Man Alive” trended for most of Wednesday, and the jokes flowed loudly and freely:  even a straight man can see there's no way blake shelton is the sexiest man alive. i dont think he's even the sexiest man named blake shelton. — Oliver Willis (@owillis) November 15, 2017  woke up this morning to news that blake shelton is the sexiest man alive. rip every sexy man in the world who died in the great sexy plague of 2017 overnight; u will be missed — I do not recall (@morninggloria) November 15, 2017  This is sexier than Blake Shelton https://t.co/j3B9B9cN4A — Jess Dweck (@TheDweck) November 15, 2017  Many social media users were quick to compare Shelton’s looks to things that are — how can we put this? — not sexy:  Blake Shelton looks like the dad in a drug commercial where they list off the side effects at the end while you watch him build a birdhouse. — DeShawn (@DeShawnstantine) November 15, 2017  Let's set the record straight: Blake Shelton looks like a second-stringer on Justified who gets murdered over a horse crime. — Kaleb Horton (@kalebhorton) November 15, 2017  If Blake Shelton is voted #SexiestManAlive then Ray Black Jr. is 2017's most popular driver. For real. Blake Shelton looks like a server at a Cracker Barrel in Gatlinburg. — nascarcasm (@nascarcasm) November 15, 2017  Blake Shelton looks like a guy who gets shredded by everyone on Shark Tank for the outrageous valuation he places on his pre-revenue floating “beer cup” that he invented after his wife left him, and it doesn’t get much sexier than that. — Gabe Delahaye (@gabedelahaye) November 15, 2017  blake Shelton looks like your middle school bus driver who got fired for buying four loko for the intimidating 8th graders who sit on the back of the bus https://t.co/fQCpg4Xx2g — maggie (@MaggieShmaggie) November 15, 2017  Of course, People is routinely derided for its choice of Sexiest Man Alive, which is a transparently PR-driven exercise often jokingly equated to a “best publicist” award. As such, each year’s choice invites a wave of alternate opinions, and 2017 is no exception, with social media users being quick to point out other, sexier alternatives to Shelton:  The same people who voted in People’s sexiest alive man list are the same folks who tampered w/ the presidential elections    There’s no way Blake Shelton is the sexiest man w/ Trevante Rhodes still breathing. pic.twitter.com/cd5NTcKJp4 — Corey Townsend (@JarrieBradshaw) November 15, 2017  Twitter users had many opinions on who the actual sexiest men of the year were, but a general consensus seemed to form around the triad of perennially overlooked frontrunner Idris Elba, upcoming Aquaman actor Jason Momoa, and the usual gaggle of white guys named Chris:  Forget the fact that Idris Elba should’ve obviously won. I can even think of like 5 white guys named Chris who are more deserving of the Sexiest Man Alive title than Blake Shelton. — Brohibition Now (@OhNoSheTwitnt) November 15, 2017  Blake Shelton is People’s Sexiest Man Alive because apparently Idris Elba, Chris Evans and Jason Momoa fell off the planet last night. — Jenn C (@TheJennC) November 15, 2017  But despite the jokes, there’s plenty of reason beyond the subjective nature of sexiness to be critical of People’s decision — namely because Shelton has been flagrantly and repeatedly homophobic in the past, once “joking” in a 2011 tweet that he would leave any gay man who tried to touch him beaten and bloody.  He also used the stage at the Country Music Awards for an aw	1
"Chris Rock roasted himself in his first stand-up comedy special in 10 years.  The comic referred to himself as a ""f-cking asshole"" for cheating on his wife of 18 years in Netflix special ""Chris Rock: Tamborine.""  ""These last few years have been crazy for me. Don't clap for that shit unless you're a lawyer,"" Rock said. ""You don't wanna get divorced. You got somebody you love, hold tight. Commit.""  The 53-year-old comedian continued to explain his regret for sleeping with three different women while he was married and on tour.  ""It's f-cked up. When guys cheat, it's like we want something new, but then you know what happens? Your woman finds out, and now sh'es new,"" Rock said. ""She is never the same again. So, now you have new, but you have a bad new.""  ""Some of these lessons you've just got to learn. Like, I brought this sh-t on myself, and you'e got to learn some lessons -- some man lessons,"" he added. ""It's my fault, because I'm a f-cking asshole. I didn't listen. I wasn't kind. I had an attitude, I thought, 'I pay for everything, I can do what I want.' That shit don't f-cking work! I just thought I was the shit.""  Rock also admitted that he was ""addicted"" to pornography throughout his marriage.  ""When you watch too much porn, you know what happens? You become, like, sexually autistic,"" the comedian said. ""You develop sexual autism. You have a hard time with eye contact and verbal cues. You get desensitized. When you start watching porn, any porn will do. Then, later on, you're all f-cked up and you need a perfect porn cocktail to get you off.""  ""I was so f-cked up -- like I needed an Asian girl with a black girl's ass that speaks Spanish just to get my dick to move an inch,"" Rock added. ""I'm a lot better now.""  But according to the comedian, the judge didn't care about his current position throughout his custody hearing because she still made him prove that he had beds for the children to sleep in and food for the kids to eat.  ""I'm like, 'What? Have you heard about me?'"" he said. ""I'm Chris Rock, not Chris Brown.""  Rock approached this section of his stand-up as a therapy session for couples to experience in order to understand the consequences when one partner steers off track such as trying to find love again.  ""You ever forget how old you are? Rihanna looked at me like I was one of her aunts. She didn't even register me as a dick-carrying member of society,"" Rock said. ""Like, I would have had an easier time f-cking Aretha Franklin.""  View Photos Getty"	1
Titanic II is set to launch in less than two years — not in movie theaters, but on the open sea.  A replica of the world’s most famous “unsinkable” ship — which struck an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage on April 15, 1912, killing 1,503 people — is under construction, with a maiden voyage planned for 2018.  Australian tycoon and politician Clive Palmer — not J. Bruce Ismay — is at the helm of the ambitious project to faithfully recreate the luxury ship, which will be about 13 feet wider to meet current regulations.  More importantly, it will carry enough lifeboats for every passenger and its hull will be welded, not riveted, just in case it comes across a rogue iceberg, the Belfast Telegraph reports.  “The new Titanic will of course have modern evacuation procedures, satellite controls, digital navigation and radar systems and all those things you’d expect on a 21st-century ship,” James McDonald, global marketing director of Palmer’s company, Blue Star Line, told the paper.  The new nine-deck ship will be 885 feet long, about two more than her doomed predecessor, 174 feet high and have a maximum speed of 24 knots. She will accommodate 2,400 passengers — 177 more than the RMS Titanic.  It also will feature the same categories of passengers — from the first-class movers and shakers to the hoi polloi in third class, where poor Leonardo DiCaprio was berthed in the classic movie.  Unlike the Belfast-built original, the Titanic II is under construction by the CSC Jinling Shipyard in Jiangsu, China.  Its maiden voyage will not be from Southampton to New York, but rather from Jiangsu, China, to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, the paper reported.  Some of the dead passengers’ relatives have criticized the plans for a new Titanic, but Blue Star has reportedly been flooded with requests for tickets — with some offering up to about $900,000 for a spot on the first trip.	0
"E! will not be returning to Mariah's World.  The Mariah Carey-led docuseries will not be returning for a second season, a spokesperson for the NBCUniversal cable network confirmed Monday.  ""E!'s Mariah's World was an eight-part event that chronicled her 2016 world tour,"" a spokesperson said in a statement. ""It was exciting to bring our viewers inside the private world of today's most iconic stars as she returned to the stage last year.""  The series followed the pop songstress as she launched her Sweet Sweet Fantasy tour in Europe while simultaneously planning her wedding to billionaire James Packer. However, she and Packer called off their engagement two months before the series launched. (Shortly after the series launched, Carey also had a well publicized lip sync mishap on ABC's New Year's Rockin' Eve.)  The eight-episode first season launched in December to 2.2 million viewers. However, viewership consistently dipped and the season finale drew just 510,000 viewers.  Mariah's World hailed from longtime E! collaborate Bunim/Murray Productions, which also produces the network's long-running hit Keeping Up With the Kardashians and its many spinoffs.  Mariah's World also marked Carey's first major TV commitment since she served as a judge on American Idol in season 12, which she called an ""abusive"" experience while promoting Mariah's World.  In addition to the Kardashians' empire, E!'s unscripted slate includes the WAGS franchise, Botched, Hollywood Medium, Famously Single, Eric and Jesse, Total Bellas and Total Divas, Second Wives Club and What Happens at the Abbey."	1
© Wesley Mann/August  A year after being fired from NBC over alleged sexual misconduct, Matt Lauer is living a quiet life away from the spotlight.  A source tells PEOPLE the disgraced new anchor has struggled to come to terms with his new normal.  “It has been hard for him. He went from being a super busy person to having nothing but time on his hands,” the source close to Lauer tells PEOPLE. “He is not doing well.”  The longtime news anchor, who was fired from the Today show in November 2017, “is not thinking about working again right now.”  “He doesn’t sit around thinking about a comeback,” adds a second source.  Instead, Lauer is focusing all his attention at home — with his children.  “He’s trying to get by putting all his energy into his kids,” says the source. “He is working on his relationship with his kids. They have a good relationship, but they’ve been through a lot.”  As Lauer, 60, and his estranged wife Annette Roque continue working out the terms of their divorce, the former couple is still living together at their Hamptons compound with sons Jack, 17, and Thijs, 11, and daughter Romy, 14.  “All he wants is to be involved in his kid’s lives,” says the second source. “He spends his days doing as much kids stuff as he can.”  And while Lauer is mainly staying home and keeping a low profile, he still makes time to socialize with friends.  “He is not dating,” adds the second source. “Some former colleagues have visited him. He has some long-term friends he sees and hangs out with on a regular basis.”  Lauer’s lawyer did not immediately return PEOPLE’s request for comment.  In May, the network released a report about the Lauer’s firing. The internal investigation, which was led by NBCUniversal general counsel Kim Harris, focused on four complainants’ allegations and resulted from nearly 70 interviews with current and former employees and more than 30 focus groups with 262 current employees. According to The New York Times, one complaint included a former NBC employee who alleged Lauer sexually assaulted her in his office in 2001.    In the first paragraphs of the report, the investigation team states that Lauer “admitted to engaging in sexual activity” with the anonymous woman whose allegations prompted his firing.  Lauer also admitted to — and apologized for — seeing NBC staffers romantically during his tenure at the network.  “Five months ago I was terminated by NBC after admitting to past relationships with co-workers. A day later I took responsibility, apologized to the people I had hurt and promised to begin the process of repairing the damage I had caused my family. I have worked every day since then to honor that promise,” he said in a statement to PEOPLE in April.  “I have made no public comments on the many false stories from anonymous or biased sources that have been reported about me over these past several months – including a claim that I would, or even could, lock someone in my office. I remained silent in an attempt to protect my family from further embarrassment and to restore a small degree of the privacy they have lost,” Lauer continued.    “But defending my family now requires me to speak up. I fully acknowledge that I acted inappropriately as a husband, father and principal at NBC. However I want to make it perfectly clear that any allegations or reports of coercive, aggressive or abusive actions on my part, at any time, are absolutely false,” he concluded.

Perched on a director’s chair in an off-the-shoulder pink Prada gown, as a man brushed her dark, flowing hair into a state of perfection, and a woman touched up her lipstick, Amal Clooney held up her phone to check her image in one hand, and clutched the notecards for an uncharacteristically personal speech in another. Amal, a woman accustomed to prosecuting war criminals at the Hague and speaking up for victims of ISIS at the United Nations, was about to talk to a ballroom full of celebrities about her husband, George Clooney. “I’m just going to remind you, because you’re tall, that you don’t have to lean into the microphone,” a stage manager told Amal, who nodded knowingly.  Amal’s composure stood in contrast to the anxiety of the professional entertainers who came to fête George at the June 6 A.F.I. Life Achievement Award gala, which TNT will air on Thursday at 10 P.M., E.S.T, and TCM will rebroadcast in September during a night of programming dedicated to George’s work.  Vanity Fair was allowed to linger in the wings of Hollywood’s Dolby Theatre during the show, a perfect perch for watching stars like Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Bill Murray, Diane Keaton, Miley Cyrus, Shirley MacLaine, Julianna Margulies, Jimmy Kimmel, Laura Dern, Anna Kendrick, and Richard Kind pay tribute to and occasionally roast their friend.  As they projected poise onstage, behind the scenes the stars grappled with stage fright, speech planning, and microphone management. Kendrick, George’s Up in the Air co-star, fidgeted with her rings and described herself to a stage manager as “very nervous but alright” before taking the stage. Exiting and clearly relieved after finishing her remarks, Kendrick bumped into George’s The Monuments Men and The Good German co-star Cate Blanchett, who looked up from a printout of her speech notes and declared, “I’m so bad at this.” (For what it’s worth, no, she’s not, but isn’t it sort of comforting to know that even the seemingly dauntless Blanchett feels anxious before giving a speech?)  “Why do we do this? We could just say no,” Kendrick said.  “I was just crying in the bathroom,” Blanchett replied.  “I’m gonna go have a whiskey, then I’m gonna go laugh so hard and be like, ‘This fucking bitch. She’s great,’” Kendrick said as a way to assure Blanchett she would have a cheerleader in the crowd during her speech. “Nice to meet you, by the way.”	0
Ariana Grande’s new engagement ring reportedly cost comedian Pete Davidson almost $100,000.  The Into You hitmaker has been spotted wearing a huge pear-shaped diamond on her left ring finger amid rumours of a secret proposal, and now sources tell TMZ.com the three-carat sparkler set Davidson back $93,000.  The Saturday Night Live regular only began dating Ariana last month, following her split from rapper Mac Miller, but he is said to have placed the custom order with New York jeweller Greg Yuna, aka Mr. Flawless, in late May.  Davidson picked up the diamond and platinum ring two weeks later.  The young couple has yet to explicitly confirm the engagement news, but Ariana did little to silence the claims as she responded to fans’ reactions on Twitter on Monday night.  After one follower asked the 24-year-old if Pete knew he was marrying her whole fanbase too, she replied, “HAHAHAHAHAHH HES BEEN BRIEFED (sic)”.  The pop star also joked that she was “crying” with laughter after another devotee referred to her as “Mrs. Davidson”.  “i’m so happy. and excited (sic),” she added to another fan.  Ariana and Pete, who parted ways with funnyman Larry David’s daughter, Cazzie David, earlier this year, appeared to celebrate their engagement with a late visit to Disneyland in California on Monday, where the singer dazzled onlookers with her new ring.  Despite moving quickly in their romance, it seems the new couple wants to take its time before tying the knot.  “They are not rushing to get married,” an insider tells Us Weekly. “Their friends are really excited and supportive.  “They are both constantly making each other laugh. Their mums have met. They’ve been very public with their relationship on social media and they are in very in love.”	1
Since the ending of the beloved Oprah’s Favorite Things on her former TV show, Ellen DeGeneres’ 12 Days of Giveaways segment, in which audience members go home with a range of sponsored products, has become hugely popular.  This year, the 49-year-old comedian kicked off the first day of giveaways by gifting the crowd a range of items from her ED by Ellen DeGeneres lifestyle brand as well as a $250 gift card to Nordstrom.  “Nordstrom have carried my ED Ellen Degeneres shoes, my handbags, my sunglasses for over two years. They make shopping really easy with all the services they offer,” the daytime talk show host shared.  While explaining the idea behind Nordstrom’s curbside pickup option, DeGeneres offered to demonstrate how it works, with one lucky audience member getting a handful of shoes as a result.  Additionally, the “Finding Dory” star and animal lover — who was forced to evacuate her California home with her pets Sunday — introduced PetCube, a pet camera that lets you see, talk and even give your furry friend treats, all from your smartphone.  A $250 gift card to Bed, Bath & Beyond, a $600 Visa gift card, a $300 Uuni oven and a six-day vacation to the The Grand at Moon Palace Cancun were also among the giveaways.

It appears Fergie and the Black Eyed Peas may have officially split. That much we know. But the story behind why the beloved hip-hop/pop group may be breaking up with their lady is a little muddled. An insider tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY what went down.  “Fergie and the [Black Eyed Peas] have parted ways,” an insider close to Peas member will.i.am told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY today, May 29, after rumors started swirling that the songstress had been booted from the hip-hop/pop group. “She wasn’t ‘kicked out.’ It was more a case of they had run their course together and were experiencing creative differences.”  Okay, that is definitely WAY less intense than what Media Take Out was reporting earlier, saying that Fergie’s bandmate Taboo Nawasha, 41, dissed the 41-year-old singer with a scathing tweet on May 24 that said she wasn’t one of the “classic” BEP members, and implied she was totally out of the band. He then unfollowed the 41-year-old singer on Twitter today, the same day it was announced she had left Interscope Records to start her own record label under BMG and will be working with them on her upcoming solo album, Double Duchess. Click here to see pics of Fergie’s “M.I.L.F. $” music video.  “Fergie has been focusing on her solo career a lot, and she wants to head in a different direction music-wise, so it was time to move on,” the insider continued. “Plus, she doesn’t want to be part of a band anymore, there are a lot of egos at play here, let’s just leave it at that. It was actually Fergie’s decision to leave, and the guys weren’t too happy about it initially, but they’re cool now and just looking forward to the future.”  Another insider close to the group told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that the group started to think about breaking up around the Super Bowl in January, when Fergie performed solo during the ESPN party in Houston, Texas. If the group — which also includes member apl.de.ap — is officially donezo, we do hope they stay on good terms. You never know when you might want a reunion tour!  HollywoodLifers, what do you think of the way Fergie and her Black Eyed Peas bandmates parted ways? Do you think it really was amicable? Give us all your thoughts below!	0
Bethenny Frankel has put her issues with Jill Zarin to the side in order to show support for Jill’s ailing husband Bobby Zarin.  The former friends and Real Housewives of New York co-stars haven’t spoken in years after a major falling out.  However, Bethenny recently swallowed her pride and put her drama with Jill on the back burner.  Instead, Bethenny showed support for the Zarin family and sent them a thoughtful gift.  In fact, Millionaire Matchmaker Patti Stranger dished about the situation on Heather McDonald’s Juicy Scoop podcast.  “Bobby’s dying. He doesn’t have a lot of time,” Patti said. “This is not something to play around with. Network antics aside, me and Andy [Cohen] have been texting and emailing, and this last week, Bethenny did send a basket of goodies to Bobby.”  Patti added, “At the end of the day, if you get sick—like Bobby—you need support, and we can all get sick.”  Patti also says she hopes that Bethenny and Jill can reconcile and move forward with their problems.  “I’m sick of the feud. I hope it ends,” Patti admitted. “[Bethenny and I] have a lot in common. She’s single. It’s not easy being a single woman. I don’t care how much money you have.”  Meanwhile, Jill’s husband Bobby continues to battle thyroid cancer and a brain tumor.  “It’s been a difficult year since his brain tumor diagnosis but ironically that’s not even the issue,” Jill previously told E! News. “His papillary thyroid cancer has morphed into something called anaplastic thyroid cancer. It’s very, very rare.”  Adding, “Right now Bobby’s okay, he’s stable. Our friends have been unbelievable in rallying around us.”  I’m so happy to hear that Bethenny sent Bobby and Jill a gift. I’m sure that the couple appreciates it so much. Perhaps this is the first step in Bethenny and Jill ending their feud.  Are you surprised Bethenny sent Bobby and Jill a gift? Do you think Jill and Bethenny can end their feud and be friends? Does Jill need all the support she can get as Bobby’s health deteriorates?  Follow AllAboutTRH On Instagram.  Follow AllAboutTRH On Twitter.  Like AllAboutTRH On Facebook.

    Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have babies on the brain again! Seven months after welcoming daughter Chicago, the couple are planning to have a fourth child, multiple sources reveal exclusively in the new issue of Us Weekly.  “[They] have one last embryo left,” one insider says, adding that the sex is male.  The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, 37, and the Grammy winner, 41, plan to have the embryo implanted in a gestational carrier “soon,” a second insider tells Us.  This will not be the first time Kardashian and West, who wed in May 2014, turn to surrogacy. They hired a gestational carrier for Chicago after the social media mogul suffered high-risk pregnancies with daughter North, 5, and son Saint, 2, due to preeclampsia and placenta accreta.  “Doctors said that it wasn’t safe for my — or the baby’s — health to carry on my own,” Kardashian wrote on her website in January, just three days after Chicago was born. “After exploring many options, Kanye and I decided to use a gestational carrier. Although I have used the term surrogate in the past, a gestational carrier is actually the technical term for a woman who carries a baby that she has no biological relationship to. A traditional surrogate donates her egg, is artificially inseminated with the father’s sperm and then carries the baby to term. Since we implanted my fertilized egg in our gestational carrier, our baby is biologically mine and Kanye’s.”  The reality star has long expressed her desire to have a big family. That said, she’ll likely draw the line at four kids. “I don’t think I could handle more than that,” she told Elle in April. “My time is spread really thin. And I think it’s important that in all couples, the mom gives the husband as much attention as the kids.”  For more on Kimye’s plans for baby No. 4, including whether they plan to hire the same surrogate, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now!

"Actor Alec Baldwin has denied that he ""punched anyone over a parking spot"" following his Friday arrest on an assault and harassment charges in New York.  In a pair of tweets dispatched from his Hilaria and Alec Baldwin Foundation Twitter account, Baldwin said that he realizes ""that it has become a sport to tag people w[ith] as many negative charges and defaming allegations as possible for the purposes of clickbait entertainment,"" but that ""no matter how reverberating the echos [sic], it doesn't make the statements true.""  Baldwin was charged with misdemeanor assault and harassment after he punched someone during what police officials described as a dispute near his home in New York City's Greenwich Village.  Baldwin is expected to appear in court on Nov. 26.  A representative for the actor had no comment.  1- Normally, I would not comment on something as egregiously misstated as today’s story.

Fortunately, no matter how reverberating the echos, it doesn’t make the statements true. — HABFoundation (@ABFalecbaldwin) November 2, 2018  Baldwin, 60, has faced legal trouble in the Big Apple in the past.  In 2014, after a New York City police officer issued him a summons him for riding his bike the wrong way on a one-way street, Baldwin allegedly said, ""I don't have identification. Just give me the f---ing summons” and “wrap this summons around your head.”  Andrew Kelly/Reuters  A police source added at the time that Baldwin “got arrogant and loud,"" which is why he was given his second summons for disorderly conduct.  Baldwin responded in a tweet of his own, naming the officer and declaring, ""New York City is a mismanaged carnival of stupidity that is desperate for revenue and anxious to criminalize behavior once thought benign.""  Meanwhile, President Donald Trump, whom Baldwin impersonates on ""Saturday Night Live,"" had a few words of encouragement for the actor, when told about the impending charge.  “I wish him luck,"" he said."	1
"""To anyone who has been affected by the reproductive coercion, we are deeply sorry. That is an extremely serious issue, and women's rights is something that is incredibly important to both of us. It is something that is very close to our hearts. We never expected a lighthearted interview we do poking fun at EACH OTHER and how WE chose together to get pregnant, a goofy moment in Barcelona with our two best friends and the anticipation of the start of our journey together as we went from two to three, to turn into something representing a very serious matter.""  The statement continues, ""However, if this somehow sheds light on a topic that definitely needs mainstream attention, then we are grateful for the unintended consequence. IT's a shame that outlets chose this as their way into a very serious discussion, as we are certainly not qualified to be the faces of this topic.

"According to Ashton Kutcher, Mila Kunis ""kicks [his] ass on character every day"" — and he wouldn't have it any other way.  During his acceptance speech for the Robert D. Ray Pillar of Character Award on Saturday, the That '70s Show actor spoke at length about what it means to be a role model and to demonstrate good character, first speaking about his twin brother before pivoting to his wife and two kids, 2-year-old Wyatt and 4-month-old Dimitri.  ""It's not whether you win or lose, it's how you learn from the mistakes that you make and how you perceive the world that's coming at you,"" he said. ""Because life doesn't happen to you, it happens for you. Every single time. And as long as you have love and kindness and optimism and a pursuit of something greater in your heart, you're the lucky one. So this award is for you. It is for my family, it's for all four of my parents, it's for my wife, who kicks my ass on character every day.""  ""I'm telling you, this morning, I woke up and she kicked my ass on character,"" he continued. ""I thought I was awesome because I got up early and helped with the kids before she woke up and I let her sleep a little bit and then she's like, 'Well, now you're gonna act tired? I do it every day.' But it was a character moment, right? Because she's right!""  Ashton went on to say that raising his children with Mila has also been the ""greatest lesson in character"" of his life, emphasizing what an ""amazing honor"" its been to be a parent.  ""When I had these kids, my wife and I had these kids and we got to share that amazing, amazing, amazing honor, my first response was, I wanted to call my parents and say, 'I'm sorry, because I never knew how much you loved me,'"" he said.

After getting canceled by Netflix at the beginning of June following the release of its second season, Sense8 is now getting a last-minute stay of execution in the form of a two-hour special. It will air in 2018, as announced through a letter from creator Lana Wachowski on the show’s Facebook page.  Death doesn't let you say goodbye. 2 hour finale episode in the works. Tell your cluster. Posted by Sense8 on Thursday, June 29, 2017  The news is particularly unexpected given that Netflix previously posted a response to the multitude of fan campaigns a week after the cancelation apologetically stating, “We've thought long and hard here at Netflix to try to make it work but unfortunately we can't.” The show was praised for its incredibly diverse cast of characters, but the multiple-location conceit meant that Sense8 was also one of the most expensive shows on television: some estimates were putting it at $9 million per episode, which may have contributed to the cancelation.  It’s unclear what exactly has changed in the intervening weeks to bring back Sense8 for a final episode, but fans of the show that were disappointed by season 2’s cliffhanger should at least take solace in the fact that there will be some kind of closure on the series.	1
Country artist Thomas Rhett and wife Lauren Akins had a year full of blessings, including officially getting to call Willa Gray their daughter. More here!  Life just one year ago was a lot different for country music star Thomas Rhett and his wife Lauren Akins. The couple had no children— but that was all about to change when they would welcome their first daughter, Willa Gray, home from Uganda in May.  Having children is something the couple has dreamed about and asked God for and now that their dreams are coming true they take every minute to gush about their two bundles of joy. On the 2018 Grammy Awards Red Carpet the two couldn’t stop talking about their girls with E! News!  Thomas Rhett said that it has been “amazing” to watch Willa be a big sister to newborn Ada James.  “She was jealous at first I think, but it’s so fun to watch her,” Thomas Rhett said. “She loves our little Ada so much.”  “It’s something we just hoped for for so long,” Lauren spoke of her eldest daughter. “She was very fresh off just coming to America, so it was something that we really wanted her to feel comfortable.”  Willa has become more comfortable with her little sister for sure! The video of the two of them meeting for the first time is heartbreakingly adorable!  “I think I was more nervous that she just wouldn’t feel comfortable but the second I was like, ‘Do you wanna give her a kiss?’ and she leaned over and kissed [Ada], I was like, ‘Thank you God,’” Lauren added on the 2018 Grammy Awards Red Carpet. “It couldn’t be sweeter.”  Having Willa become an official member of the family wasn’t easy though. TR and Lauren also opened up about the emotional aspect it took to officially call her their daughter.  “It is definitely the hardest thing we’ve ever been through,” Lauren shared with E! News. “But I think it needs to be hard because you have to fight for that baby just like you do. I’ve done both now — I’ve had one biological and I’ve had one through adoption. It’s a battle to bring your child home. And it just strengthens you as parents and as a team. It is hard but it’s so worth it.”  Since Willa Gray has been home the whole Akins clan has just been enjoying life together and accomplishing many milestones. From Willa Gray’s first birthday with her family to Christmas as a family of four, they’ve done it all and with big smiles on their faces!

Ryan Reynolds had a hilarious response to Wonder Woman beating Deadpool at the box office  Wonder Woman has undoubtedly been one of the movie highlights of the year.  Not least because it means DC have finally turned out a good movie, after the unwaftable stinkers that were Man of Steel, Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice and Suicide Squad.  Despite the critical panning those three film got, they still made a shedload of money - there is, after all, no accounting for taste. However, it was heartening to see that Wonder Womanhighest grossing superhero movies has broken into the top 10 of all time.  Patty Jenkins' film has taken a staggering $368 million, making it the highest-grossing film directed by a woman, while also surpassing Deadpool's $360 million, nudging it into 11th place in the superhero rankings.  Advertisement  Ryan Reynolds, star of Deadpool, marked Wonder Woman overtaking his movie with a classy (and only a little crass) post on Instagram.  The Merc May Be Filthier, but Her B.O. is Stronger. Congrats #WonderWoman #BoxOfficeBoss A post shared by Ryan Reynolds (@vancityreynolds) on Jul 10, 2017 at 6:08pm PDT  Nicely done.	1
It seems that Rihanna has decided to respond to the rumors that she is expecting a baby with boyfriend Hassan Jameel. In a typical Rihanna fashion, she laughed off the rumors.  According to an insider, the singer is not expecting, and she is not even trying to enter motherhood at the moment.  A person, who attended a big event with the couple, explained: “She is not pregnant lol. She was taking shots backstage last night and drinking at the afterparty.”  Another source spoke to Hollywood Life and added: “At this point, Rihanna feels like all she can do is laugh off all the pregnancy rumors, in addition to just ignoring them now. She is not pregnant, and she is not even trying to get pregnant either at this point.”  Rihanna on her way to 1OAK nightclub ? A post shared by badgalriri (@badgalririr8) on Jan 29, 2018 at 4:15am PST  However, there will be little Riri or Hassan in the future.  The insider shared: “Would she like children in the future? Yes, but definitely in the future, she is simply not ready to start a family… just yet. Rihanna loves children though, she is a natural mom, and she thinks Hassan will make an amazing father — he is really kind and patient, and a very loving person — but right now she is focused on her career first and foremost. Plus, Rihanna has not even met his family yet.”  Riri ??? A post shared by badgalriri (@badgalririr8) on Jan 28, 2018 at 8:50pm PST  After Rihanna performed at the Grammys, social media exploded because she appeared to have a baby bump.  One supporter said: “She makes me feel better for eating a whole bag of red vines. If RiRi thick, I’m thick too, darnnit. Is Rihanna Pregnant? Asking for a friend! She looks great thick.Waiting for her to announce that she is pregnant.”  Another commenter wrote: “So we just gonna ignore that fact that Riri looked a little thicker than usual in that skin tight dress she performed with DJ Khaled. She looks pregnantWhy does she keep holding her tummy??? Is she pregnant???”  Rihanna’s ex-boyfriend, Chris Brown, had an odd reaction to the rumors: “Chris always had high hopes for their future together, and even though there are only rumors that she could be pregnant with some other guy’s baby, he is still pretty upset and sad to hear about it. He feels like that should be his baby.”  Advertisement  Commenters say that Brown should move on.	0
    All Nick Cannon wanted for Christmas was to be with his family. The former America’s Got Talent host jetted off to Aspen on Sunday, December 23, to join his ex-wife Mariah Carey and their twins Moroccan and Monroe.  Cannon, 38, took to Instagram on Monday to share a photo Monroe took when he was dozing by a Christmas tree. “When your daughter catches the rare occasion of you sleeping!” the rapper captioned his picture. “Daddy, I thought you don’t ever sleep?’ #MissMonroe.”  That same night, Carey posted a snap of herself cozying up under a blanket with Moroccan.  Cannon and the five-time Grammy winner ended their six-year marriage in 2014, but remain close friends and coparents. (They always celebrate birthdays together!)  “The common denominator is we both want what’s best for our children,” the Drumline actor told Us Weekly in February. “You put them first and you step back and become selfless in making decisions and it’s pretty easy.”  Cannon added that as far as he is concerned, Carey can “do no wrong.”  Just like their famous parents, Moroccan and Monroe were born to perform. “They’re definitely entertainers,” Cannon told Us in July. “They’re hams!” But Moroccan might have a future career in tech: the comedian quipped that little boy tapped into his email and changed all the settings.  “I know none of the passwords,” he said at the time. “All of my emails say it’s coming from Moroccan and Monroe.”  Carey described Moroccan as a “technological genius” when she appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! in June and revealed that he ordered a dog online without her knowing.  Cannon is also dad of 22-month-old son Golden “Sagon” with model Brittany Bell.	1

"Shida Kaviani, Shirin Kaviani, Shideh Kaviani. Those names probably don't immediately ring any bells, but a mention of the sisters' popular and super affordable clothing brand, Naked Wardrobe, should do the trick. The label, whose Instagram page boasts over 1.1 million followers, was founded in 2012 on the desire to create basic wardrobe essentials—bodysuits, biker shorts, and figure-hugging dresses, all of which fall under the $100 price point—that not only ""look good, but feel good and makes customers happy, all at an affordable price."" In six years, Naked Wardrobe's initial collection has expanded to include luxe faux fur coats, sexy (thong) bathing suits, and other late-night-ready pieces.  With fast-fashion brands and influencers dominating our social feeds, loyalty is the hardest thing for a brand to obtain and the easiest thing for them to lose. But Naked Wardrobe doesn't seem to have that problem, especially when the Kardashian/Jenner sisters, Jennifer Lopez, Lady Gaga, and Beyonce (!) are pretty much the brand's unofficial brand ambassadors.    We caught up with the founders of Naked Wardrobe to get the scoop on how they got their start, the secret to running their cult-favorite brand, and how they've built their celebrity clientele.  Naked Wardrobe is six this year! How'd it all start?  Shideh: We started out of our parents’ house six years ago. It all started because we all have a shopping addiction. We have a passion for fashion and for ordering stuff online and having them be delivered to our door. Back then, when we first started doing e-comm, people were really hesitant to shop online. It just wasn’t the norm back then and social media was different. But social media allowed us to have this platform to really grow our business.    Did you all study any fashion in school?  Shideh: Yeah! I studied Fashion design at FIDM and I got a bachelors in business managemen,t so I definitely had some direction and insight when it came to fashion and the business side of things.  Shida: I studied communications and PR and I worked in PR. I got my feet wet at Capitol records and Warner Brother’s PR and learned the ropes in that aspect.  Shirin: I studied graphic design and I have a little bit of a computer science background. I work well with a computer—I’m a little bit of a geek—so an online shop was kind of the way to go for that and is what pushed us to launch one.  What was the initial reason you all launched Naked Wardrobe?  Shideh: High quality fashion at an affordable price. Either it was high quality and you had to pay like $100 for a t-shirt, or get something that was not as high quality and more on the disposable end for $15-$25. There weren't many affordable options then, and at that time, the recession was still impacting the economy. I felt like it was important to introduce a line that was really high in quality but still affordable for the masses.    Shirin: We’re aware that the majority of the world can’t afford $100 pieces and we wanted to make sure that if we bring out a line that you can wash x amount of times, it’s still not going to get damaged; that when you wear it you feel great and comfortable, the fabric feels amazing and that’s why a lot of celebrities gravitate towards it. Whether they wear it or someone who's interning wears it, we’re all the same in the end and it’s nice that everyone from different spectrums can wear the brand.  How long after you launched did business really start to pick up?  Shideh: When we first started, we really didn’t know where it would go. We thought we would be able to wear a bunch of free clothes that we were selling ourselves. But from the first day we launched, we started to bring in the revenue, and it’s just been growing ever since.  Walk me through the creative process.  Shideh: When it comes to designing, I want it to be something that’s comfortable, sexy, that people feel good in. My sister Shirin is really adamant about us creating trends and starting things an"	1

Medalion Rahimi should be used to the royal treatment. After all, she’s played princesses on two Shonda Rhimes shows. But, like her characters’ roads to the throne, Rahimi—who currently stars in her second princess role on Rhimes’s latest series, “Still Star-Crossed”—didn’t face an easy path to success.  As a first-generation Iranian American, Rahimi was bullied for her textured brown hair and light-red freckles, which are natural Iranian traits passed down from her mother and grandmother. And though they’ve become Rahimi’s most complimented features (just take a look at her Instagram), they were also the source of her darkest insecurities growing up. “It’s made me stronger as a person,” she says. “I feel like if people can just wait out adolescence, it does get so much better.”  “ If people can just wait out adolescence, it does get so much better. ”  Raised by two Iranian immigrants who fled Iran in the ’70s to escape a dictatorship, Rahimi spent her childhood crammed into a one-bedroom apartment in the San Fernando Valley with her parents and older brother. While her parents steadily worked their way up—her dad as a dentist; her mom as an attorney—Rahimi’s struggles continued in school.  “I had buck teeth, frizzy hair, freckles, and a retainer,” Rahimi says. “People called me Hermione sometimes, which I loved because I thought she was brave, but they meant it in sort of a mean way.” Along with calling her “metal mouth,” Rahimi’s classmates would make fun of her hair and say her freckles were a sign of disease. “It’s part of the reason why I’m so quiet,” she says. “It’s something I’ve learned to embrace, but it was definitely hard.”  As a result of the bullying, Rahimi withdrew into herself and made efforts to change her appearance. To hide her hair texture, she braided her hair every day before graduating to a straightener. She even tried shaving parts of her head and dabbled in keratin treatment. When she started using makeup, she did her best to mask her freckles.  Rahimi slowly started regaining her confidence at age 12, when she starred as Cha-Cha DiGregorio in a seventh-grade production of Grease—a role she auditioned for on a whim that sparked her passion for acting. “It was a place where I could have a voice,” Rahimi says. “I was such a quiet kid that performing became a time when people would listen to me.”  “ Performing became a time when people would listen to me. ”  After a push from a high school drama teacher, Rahimi went on to study theatre at the University of California, Los Angeles before finding an agent and nabbing small parts in the indie world. But she still felt plagued by the insecurities she faced growing up. “I would go to auditions with a full face of makeup and straightened hair, thinking that that’s what people were looking for,” she says.  It wasn’t until about four years ago, when Rahimi was 21 and dating a man who was raised with a different view of beauty, that her own perspective started to shift. “He grew up in Paris and women there don’t really wear makeup. They are a little bit naturale,” says Rahimi. “He told me to just embrace my natural hair.”  As a result, Rahimi grew out her natural hair, which was cut short and slightly damaged from the keratin, and toned down her makeup drastically. “I started getting so many nice compliments from women who had incredible hair who were like, ‘I want your hair,’” she says. “You’re telling me you want my hair? It was crazy. I noticed as soon as I stopped doing that was when I really started to book roles, too.”  Soon after, Rahimi scored her big break on Rhimes’s comedy crime-drama show, “The Catch,” playing Princess Zara Al-Salim, a headstrong modern-day Arabian princess. Though the part only lasted three episodes, Rahimi caught Rhimes’s eye, who cast her as a series regular in “Still Star-Crossed,” a multi-ethnic take on Shakespeare’s Romeo and Juliet. In it, Rahimi stars as Princess Isabella, one of five leads of color.  Though the show has faced 	1
"If the Grammy Awards proved anything on Jan. 28, they only solidified that Rihanna is kween and we all need to bow down. She always looks amazing, she's mega talented, and she has a badass attitude about life. Do not come for Rihanna or I will come for you. If RiRi is hanging out with someone, especially a potential boyfriend, you best believe fans will jump all over it... or so you would think. Her latest rumored relationship has managed to stay surprisingly low-key. Who is Rihanna dating? His name is Hassan Jameel and the two have been linked together for about seven months.  Back in June of 2017, photos were released of RiRi getting hot and heavy with Jameel in a hot tub. The photos have since been deleted, but people were mostly wondering who the heck this seemingly random guy with Rihanna was in Spain.  As it turns out, Jameel is extremely well-known throughout the world. As the Toyota heir, he's wealthy — like, really wealthy. For 80 years, Jameel's family has been, ""the sole owners of the right to sell Toyota cars in Saudi Arabia,"" according to COED. This results in his net worth sitting at a hefty $1.5 billion.  In addition, the 29-year-old also serves as the deputy president and vice chairman of his family's company, Abdul Latif Jameel. According to Daily Mail, this is one of the biggest companies in the entire world.  Money is great, but I don't think it matters to Rihanna one bit. With her own net worth at $36 million, according to Forbes, she can take care of her own damn self. This relationship is definitely rooted in good ol' fashioned chemistry. According to a source from Daily Mail, Rihanna is ""smitten"" with Jameel. The source said,  This relationship is the real deal. Rihanna has told friends she's in love with him and seems completely smitten. They've been spending a lot of time together away from prying eyes and are really serious. They're really enjoying each others' company.  Like I said earlier, all this info came to the surface back in June. After a quick obsession session, everyone moved on to other things. Rihanna, Jameel, and their potential relationship was swept under the rug, and I didn't know if we would ever hear from them again.  That is, until the 2018 Grammys. After Rihanna won her Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration with Kendrick Lamar and performed ""Wild Thoughts"" with DJ Khaled and Bryson Tiller, she went out to celebrate.  Kevin Winter/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  According to E! News, Rihanna and Jameel were both seen at the famous 1 OAK nightclub in NYC. Although they arrived and were photographed separately, sources claim the two were ""coupled up"" all night. A source said the two weren't afraid to flaunt a little PDA, and Rihanna ""seemed so happy"" with Jameel. The source told E!,  Rihanna and Hassan showed affection throughout the evening. It was cool because he can roll with Rihanna, he fits in great.  The source continued,  He was always making sure she was OK and had everything she needed. Rihanna was dancing and having a great time.  The two sound like a fabulous couple. Another eyewitness account of the two came from realtor and famous NYC and Miami socialite, Malcolm Edwards. He exclusively told E!,  Rihanna was sitting with her boyfriend Hassan at 1 OAK owner Richie Akiva's table. They weren't being overly romantic but definitely showed some PDA throughout the night. They were happy to see Diddy and his girlfriend Cassie when they showed up at the table. They hugged and kissed hello. The foursome laughed throughout the night and enjoyed music.  At the owner's table with Diddy... no biggie. Just a day in the life of Rihanna. The two being friends with other couples could prove that their relationship is getting serious. Hopefully, we'll be hearing more about Rihanna and Jameel in the near future.  Basically, if Rihanna is happy, I'm happy. It's so exciting the singer may have a new-ish man in her life to celebrate the good stuff. NOTHING BUT GOOD THOUGHTS AND WISHES"	0
Credit: Kanye West on Twitter  Kanye West Confronts Kim Kardashian’s Rumored Other Man — Report  by 0 Shares  Advertisement  Kanye West cannot take these cheating rumors. Yeezy, 39, is so fed up with the speculation Kim Kardashian is cheating on him, he reportedly went straight to the source and called his wife’s alleged other man, Marquette King.  A photo posted by Marquette King (@marquetteking) on Jan 4, 2017 at 8:27am PST  Credit: Kim Kardashian on Instagram  North West’s parents apparently got into an “explosive fight” last week after Kimmy, 35, was accused of cheating with football player Marquette. “Kanye called Marquette himself behind Kim’s back. He needed to know once and for all if this was true,” an insider tells RadarOnline.com. So, what did Marquette say?  The contents of the rapper and athlete’s convo is still a secret. But, it’s clear the “Stronger” performer may have wrecked his relationship even further by having the chat.  “Kim told Kanye to drop it, and he did not, and it caused even more drama between them!” the chatty pal claims. It’s possible Kim has already forgiven her husband for his supposed impulsive behavior, as another pal says the Kardashian-West marriage is on the mend after months of divorce rumors.  Credit: Instagram  A photo posted by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Sep 30, 2016 at 10:57am PDT  “Kanye and Kim are still in that very polite stage after a blow up,” a source tells People. Still, things are far from perfect for the duo following Kim’s Paris robbery, Kanye’s mental breakdown, and his controversial meeting with reality star-turned-president elect, Donald Trump.  A photo posted by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Sep 16, 2016 at 6:58am PDT  “They’re getting along better, but it’s still a difficult time,” the insider continues. The aforementioned issues aren’t the only strains on the famous pair’s love life.  “Kanye still doesn’t have closure about his mother, and I don’t know that he ever will,” the friend explains of Donda West’s death in 2007. When the anniversary comes along, it’s like the wound is reopened. Some years, he does okay in managing it … This was a year where things went off the rails.” At least Kim and Kanye’s latest appearance on social media proves they’re moving forward.	0
Travis Scott wanted Kylie Jenner to celebrate Thanksgiving with him in Houston but she said now. Now, we’ve EXCLUSIVELY learned these two fought over her decision to hide her alleged pregnancy from the public!  Travis Scott, 25, nearly had the perfect Thanksgiving. He was missing just one ingredient: Kylie Jenner! The 20-year-old Keeping up with the Kardashians star was invited to join Travis in his hometown of Houston, but she decided to kick it with her family at home (where she would be far from the public eye.) This, needless to say, left Travis with a bad taste in his mouth. “Travis is super supportive of Kylie and obviously wants her to do whatever she needs to do to take the best care of herself but he does wish she’d come out of hiding,” a source close to Travis EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com.  “It’s hard for him because he wants them to do normal stuff together, instead of just hiding out at her house,” the source tells HollywoodLife.com. The insider brought up that Travis and Cactus Jack Records hosted a turkey drive for Hurricane Harvey relief in downtown Houston on Nov. 23. “He was begging her to come out and do it with him, but she said no. She doesn’t want to be photographed at all right now. They had a bit of a fight over it. He’s proud of her and wanted her there by his side. He was disappointed she wouldn’t come.”  Oh no! Does this mean that Kylie and her alleged baby daddy are on the rocks? Thankfully, this was just a bump in the road, as the insider told HollywoodLife.com that “they made up” afterward. “He can’t ever stay mad at her for long but this whole thing of her wanting to say in hiding is an issue for him. He’s trying his best to be understanding but he does question this whole need for her to stay in hiding,” the insider added. “He doesn’t really get it.  Travis may need to “get it” soon, because Kylie reportedly doesn’t want to go out in public until her alleged baby is born. She wants to “disappear” and focus on her health and happiness during this reported pregnancy, and she reportedly won’t even address it until she gives birth. Kylie is also reportedly “horrified” with how her body has changed with pregnancy, and the last thing she wants to do is leave the house. Well, it seems Travis better not expect Ky to join him if he celebrates Christmas in Clutch City. Maybe next year?  What do you think Travis and Kylie should do, HollywoodLifers? Do you think he should be more understanding?	0

Instagram quickly outgrew its first impression as a fun app for kids and has become a serious content marketing, selling, networking and audience building tool for individuals and brands. It's one of the most popular social networking sites on the planet, with over 200 million active monthly members sharing 60 million images and 1.6 billion likes per day.  Just how awesome is it? Engagement rates for brands on most social networks are less than 0.1%, but Instagram blows them all away. The average Instagram engagement rate for brands in a 2014 Forrester study was an epic 58 times higher than on Facebook.  You can't argue with numbers like that. But that's just average. And as I advocate across all manners of online marketing, you don't want to be average! It's not a dream or a goal.  Sure, 58 times greater engagement than Facebook sounds great, but you can do so much better than that on Instagram. Whether you're a big brand or maybe just wondering how to become Instagram famous, I don't want you to strive for average; I want you to reach for the stars and become an Instagram unicorn. A digital unicorn is that magical, rare creature that outperforms all others by orders of magnitude.  And you're going to accomplish this by working these eleven amazing Instagram hacks into your social strategy. Check out these attention-getting ideas for your Instagram captions, hashtags, profile, and more, and see what to post on Instagram to get more followers and way more visibility and engagement too.  1. Cross-promote your dedicated hashtag.  That's nice that you created a #joesgarage hashtag for your company, but who knows to use it to share content about you? Make sure it's in your profile, but take the game offline and have it printed on your receipts, in print ads, on signage in your store and at relevant events.  If you're on radio and TV, direct people to use your hashtag. Integrate online and offline campaigns by ensuring it's listed on your other social profiles, on your website, and in your email blasts. Don't just hope people will find it.  2. Get creative with hashtagging.  When it comes to Instagram caption ideas, you need to look beyond the one-word, obvious hashtags. Sure, you want to use those, too, but mix it up and use hashtags to tell part of your story. Be funny, ironic, or outrageous--just don't be BORING. Collaborative workspace company WeWork is great at this, and they include a fun mix of Instagram content, too.  3. Participate in massively popular conversations.  For every post, use a mix of topically relevant hashtags such as #woodworking for a carpentry company, for example, as well as trending, super-popular hashtags wherever you can.  The really specific hashtags are like long-tail keywords in that they show more intent and help you find the right people, but the universally trending hashtags like #instagood, #tbt, #photooftheday or even plain old #fun get you in front of more people in general. You need both to make it on a social network as big and noisy as Instagram.  4. Make the most of your bio URL.  It's prime real estate on your Instagram profile... do you really want your bio to only link to your website homepage, now and forever? Yawn. Change it up at least bi-weekly and use that clickable link in your bio to drive traffic to your newest or most popular content.  5. Get descriptive with your captions.  A picture is worth a thousand words, but you can't skip the words entirely. National Geographic is fantastic at using storytelling alongside their Instagram photos to generate engagement and sharing. While traditional media brands have dropped like flies, NatGeo has thrived across digital and become one of the top brands on Instagram, with over 50 million followers.  Like the other Instagram hacks I've included here, this is something you'll want to commit to working into your strategy over time, so don't worry if it feels weird at first. Your writing will improve as you find your brand's Instagram voice.  	1
They famously coined the phrase 'conscious uncoupling' when they announced the end of their 11-year marriage in 2014.  But even though they're no longer husband and wife, it seems friendly exes Gwyneth Paltrow, 44, and Chris Martin, 40, remain the best of friends.  Sharing a photo on her Instagram page, the actress and her former spouse joined forces for a day out with daughter Apple, 13, and son Moses, 11, at the Museum Of Ice Cream in Los Angeles on Sunday.  Scroll down for video  Family affair: Friendly exes Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin enjoyed a day out with daughter Apple, 13, and son Moses, 11, at the Museum Of Ice Cream in Los Angeles on Sunday  Celebrating both Apple's birthday and Mother's Day, the family looked as though they were having a blast on their day out at the museum, billed as a 'place where flavours are mysteries and toppings are toys'.  The Coldplay frontman looked to be enjoying the company of daughter Apple and son Moses along with beaming ex-wife Gwyneth.  The youngster was bearing a remarkable similarity to her actress mother, proving the apple doesn't fall too far from the tree.  Alongside the snap, Gwyneth wrote: 'Best Apple's birthday/Mother's Day EVER at the @museumoficecream @autumncomm SO FUN #goopgo #dtla.'  Mini me: The family were celebrating celebrating both Apple's birthday and Mother's Day as they enjoyed their day out at the museum  Apple was pictured in a pink hoodie with leopard print leggings and UGG boots.  Moses donned an equally sporty look with a darker pink hoodie with navy and black tracksuit bottoms and black Jeezy trainers.  Chris looked laid back in black skinny jeans and a vintage white t-shirt.  He rocked up the look with a blue G-Shock watch and blue and white Air Jordan trainers.  Fashionista Gwyneth looked chic in a floral maxi skirt and fitted black vest.  In 2014, Gwyneth told readers of her website of her impending divorce after 11 years of marriage.  Divorce: Gwyneth and Chris broke the news of their marital split in March 2014 writing 'it is with hearts full of sadness that we have decided to separate'  Gwyneth and Chris broke the news of their marital split in March 2014, writing: 'It is with hearts full of sadness that we have decided to separate.'  They went on to explain that the split had been on the cards for 'well over a year' and that in many ways they were closer than ever.  She described the process as 'conscious uncoupling'.  'We have always conducted our relationship privately, and we hope that as we consciously uncouple and co-parent, we will be able to continue in the same manner,' the statement continued.  But since the couple's heartbreaking split it appears the family unit is stronger than ever.  Happy together: Since the couple's heartbreaking split in March 2014 after 11 years of marriage it appears the family unit is stronger than ever  According to the teachings of conscious uncoupling, humans simply aren't meant to stay married for so long.  They point toward the exponential increase in lifespan that humans have experienced in the last century or so: 'We’re living three lifetimes compared to early humans, perhaps we need to redefine the construct.  'Social research suggests that because we’re living so long, most people will have two or three significant long-term relationships in their lifetime.  'Our biology and psychology aren’t set up to be with one person for four, five, or six decades.'  Gwyneth has since moved on with Glee co-creator Brad Falchuk, 46, who she's been dating since 2014.  Chris has been dating actress Annabelle Wallis, 32, for the past 18 months, and enjoyed a brief romance with Hollywood leading lady Jennifer Lawrence, 26, in the summer of 2015.	1
"Rob Kardashian and Blac Chyna have reached a private agreement over custody of their 10-month-old daughter Dream Kardashian, while the Lashed salon owner will no longer pursue a domestic violence case against her ex...for now.  The two had split earlier this year after a one-year relationship. In July, Rob posted on Instagram a slew of naked pics of Chyna and a video of her kissing another man, which he said she sent him. He accused her of cheating, belittled her and threatened that she would never see their daughter again unless she stopped ""the alcohol and drugs and cocaine and X and E.""  Chyna responded on Snapchat by claiming Rob had ""beat"" her and obtained a temporary domestic violence restraining order against him. It does not involve Dream.

"All four of Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip's kids were pretty much raised exclusively by nannies. Shortly after their daughter Princess Anne was born, when their son Prince Charles was only three years old, both parents went on a six-month Commonwealth tour, leaving their kids behind with ""the help.""  When the couple came back, they greeted their attention-starved children not with hugs but with handshakes. Years later when Charles was sick at school, bedridden with Asian flu, his loving parents didn't even visit him."	1

    My good buddy Milo Ventimiglia who was nice enough to invite me to be on the show #thisisus #harleydavidson A post shared by Sly Stallone (@officialslystallone) on Aug 12, 2017 at 7:10pm PDT  Sylvester Stallone is ready for his close-up! The veteran actor reunited with his Rocky Balboa costar Milo Ventimiglia while filming scenes for season 2 of This Is Us.  Stallone, 71, took to Instagram on Saturday, August 12, to share photos from the set of the NBC drama as he began working on his one-episode role. He will play an actor who helps Kevin Pearson (Justin Hartley) adjust to fame on the set of a period war film directed by Ron Howard.    10 Most Devastating TV Deaths of 2016  Ventimiglia, 40, revealed on Jimmy Kimmel Live! earlier this month that he called the Rocky actor to see if he’d be willing to appear on This Is Us. Stallone shared a photo with the Emmy nominee on Instagram on Saturday, writing, “My good buddy Milo Ventimiglia who was nice enough to invite me to be on the show.”  Ventimiglia opened up about Stallone’s role in a recent interview. “It’s nice to know that the material attracts the greats even like Sly,” he told Entertainment Tonight. “And to know that he’d want to be a part and play with us, it’s a very good feeling, so we’re thrilled.”  On the THIS IS US set with Justin Hartley , this is a fantastic show and he is great to work with!#thisisus @justinhartley A post shared by Sly Stallone (@officialslystallone) on Aug 12, 2017 at 6:57pm PDT  Getting punched out by the amazing@chrissymetz On the set of THIS IS US #thisisus A post shared by Sly Stallone (@officialslystallone) on Aug 12, 2017 at 7:04pm PDT  Stallone also shared some behind-the-scenes snaps with other members of the cast. “On the THIS IS US set with Justin Hartley , this is a fantastic show and he is great to work with!” he captioned a picture with Hartley, 40.  The three-time Oscar nominee then posted a photo of Chrissy Metz playfully punching him in the face. “Getting punched out by the amazing @chrissymetz on the set of THIS IS US,” he wrote.  It is unlikely that Stallone and Ventimiglia will share the screen again, though. Ventimiglia’s beloved character, Jack Pearson, died prior to the present-day scenes on This Is Us.  Still, Stallone will play a “father figure” to Hartley’s character, creator Dan Fogelman said at the Television Critics Association press tour. “We needed a big star for this movie, and we’re really excited for the script,” Fogelman said on August 3.  This Is Us season 2 premieres on NBC on Tuesday, September 26, at 9 p.m. ET.	1
Does Meghan Markle Want 5 Kids? Prince Harry Has Some Thoughts  The royal newlyweds may still be basking in their honeymoon glow, but of course people are already wondering if Prince Harry and Meghan Markle want kids. When pressed by fans, the Prince has made it clear exactly how many kids is too many, but that doesn’t mean babies won’t be part of the couple’s future.  Prince Harry and Meghan Markle have already been forthcoming about wanting to have a family. During their first interview with the BBC after getting engaged, they were questioned about having kids and Prince Harry responded,”I think one step at a time and hopefully we’ll start a family in the near future.”  ADVERTISEMENT  The question is, exactly how many kids? With big brother Prince William having recently welcomed his third child, is a big family on the horizon for Prince William as well? It might be, but there’s a definitely a limit as one fan learned.  During the couple’s recent visit to Dublin, Prince Harry was greeting fans when one mom, Elaine Adam-Stewart, pressed him on their future plans. Adam-Stewart told the Prince that she and her redheaded husband have five kids and asked, “When are you and Meghan going to get going?” Recalling the moment to PEOPLE, Adam-Stewart said “He laughed and said, ‘five children?—too many,’.”  Five might be out of the question, but we can’t wait until Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis have a new cousin to play with.  —Shahrzad Warkentin  Featured Photo: Kensington Royal via Instagram  RELATED STORIES:  Does Meghan Markle Want Kids with Prince Harry?

"Stop what you're doing. Stop it right now. I have to show you something. Quick!!  It is these photos of a movie starring Liam Hemsworth, Priyanka Chopra, and Rebel Wilson. But these are not just any photos. They are bonkers photos.  They come from the New York City set of Isn't It Romantic, a romantic comedy coming out on Valentine's Day 2019. According to Variety, it's about a ""a cynical young woman who doesn’t believe in love and then wakes up one day to discover that her life has become a romantic comedy.""  Per The Hollywood Reporter, Adam Devine and Liam Hemsworth star as the lucky guys in Wilson's love triangle, ""with Devine playing a character who is stuck in the friend zone and Hemsworth the hunky object of Wilson’s affections."" As for Chopra, she will portray ""yoga ambassador Isabella,"" apparently—which, okay!  But back to these photos. They are as tinged with movie magic as you'd expect for a meta romantic comedy.

After suprising speculation that The Weeknd is dating Justin Bieber’s ex, Yovanna Ventura, HollywoodLife.com has EXCLUSIVELY learned what Justin thinks of the whole situation. Find out if he’s upset here!  The Weeknd, 27, was recently seen getting cozy with Justin Bieber‘s ex, Yovanna Ventura, 21, and we have the real answer on whether or not it’s bothering Justin, who is now reportedly dating The Weeknd’s ex, Selena Gomez, 25. “Justin couldn’t care less about The Weeknd dating Yovanna,” a source EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com. “Justin’s got his eye on the prize, which of course, is Selena. Justin is determined not to make the same mistakes that he’s made in the past, so he’s reigning in any insecurities and keeping his jealousy in check. Justin is also allowing Selena to set the pace when it comes to their relationship, instead of strong arming her as he’s done previously. Justin’s so grateful to be given another shot at dating Selena, and he’s doing everything in his power to not mess it up. Justin thinks it’s serendipitous that Selena’s come back to him at the time he’s decided to take a career break, because it means he can totally focus on her and they can spend some real quality time together. Selena is the love of his life and Justin is determined not to let her slip through his fingers yet again.” See pics of The Weeknd and Justin with Selena here!  Justin dated Yovanna for a bit back in 2014 and during that time, he seemed pretty smitten with the gorgeous brunette. He’d post photo after photo of her on his social media until one day it all just stopped when they split. Although their relationship seemed intense while it was going on, it’s been three years since they hooked up so it would make complete sense if Justin was over it by now.

"American actor  For other people named Robert Wagner, see Robert Wagner (disambiguation)  Robert John Wagner Jr. (born February 10, 1930) is an American actor of stage, screen, and television, best known for starring in the television shows It Takes a Thief (1968–1970), Switch (1975–1978), and Hart to Hart (1979–1984). He also had a recurring role as Teddy Leopold on the TV sitcom Two and a Half Men and has a recurring role as Anthony DiNozzo Sr. on the police procedural NCIS.  In movies, Wagner is known for his role as Number 2 in the Austin Powers trilogy of films (1997, 1999, 2002), as well as for A Kiss Before Dying, The Pink Panther, Harper, The Towering Inferno and many more.  In 2018, Wagner was named a person of interest in an ongoing investigation into the mysterious drowning death of his wife, Natalie Wood, in 1981.[1]  Early life [ edit ]  Wagner was born February 10, 1930, in Detroit, Michigan. He is the son of Hazel Alvera (née Boe), a telephone operator, and Robert John Wagner Sr., a traveling salesman who worked for the Ford Motor Company. His paternal grandparents were from Germany[2][3] and his maternal grandparents were Norwegian. Wagner has a sister, Mary. He graduated from Saint Monica Catholic High School in 1949.[4]  Wagner became interested in acting, and after an unsuccessful screen test directed by Fred Zinnemann for his film Teresa, Wagner was represented by Albert R. Broccoli.[5]  He made his uncredited film debut in The Happy Years (1950); was signed by agent Henry Willson and put under contract with 20th Century-Fox.[6]  20th Century Fox and Columbia [ edit ]  ""I started off as an ingenue,"" recalled Wagner. ""I was 19 years old. I was the boy next door. But you always felt you could work your way up, that you could have a better part in the next picture. {Head of Fox} Darryl Zanuck was always placing me in different positions.""[6]  Wagner's first film for Fox was Halls of Montezuma (1951) a World War Two film. Wagner had a supporting role, with Richard Widmark as the star. The studio then had him perform a similar function in another war movie, The Frogmen (1951), again with Widmark; the cast also included another young male under contract to the studio, Jeffrey Hunter, with whom Wagner would often work. Let's Make It Legal (1951) was a comedy where Wagner again supported an older star, in this case Claudette Colbert.[7]  Wagner first gained significant attention with a small but showy part as a shell-shocked soldier in With a Song in My Heart (1952), starring Susan Hayward as Jane Froman.[7]  ""You were part of 20th Century Fox,"" he said. ""You felt proud of being part of the organization. When I wasn't working, I was on the road, going out and selling movies or dancing on the stage and meeting the public. They never let you rest.""[6]  Fox started to give Wagner better roles. He was the romantic male lead in Stars and Stripes Forever (1952), a biopic about John Philip Sousa starring Clifton Webb. He supported James Cagney and Dan Dailey in John Ford's version of What Price Glory (1952) and supported Webb again in Titanic (1953). He was in a minor Western, The Silver Whip (1953) with Rory Calhoun.[7]  Leading man [ edit ]  Fox gave Wagner his first starring role in Beneath the 12-Mile Reef (1953). Reviews were poor but the movie was only the third ever to be shot in CinemaScope and was a big hit.[8]  Also popular was a Western, Broken Lance (1954), where Wagner supported Spencer Tracy for director Edward Dmytryk, appearing as Tracy's son. Fox gave Wagner the lead in an expensive spectacular, Prince Valiant (1954). While popular, critical reception was poor and Wagner later joked his wig in the movie made him look like Jane Wyman. He was teamed with Jeffrey Hunter in a Western, White Feather (1955).[7]  Wagner was borrowed by Paramount for The Mountain (1956), directed by Dmytryk, where Wagner was cast as Spencer Tracy's brother, having played his son just two years earlier in the same director's Broke"	1

Although it’s been announced the royal couple will officially reside in Kensington Palace when they are married, Megha and Harry are planning to spend at least ‘four months’ in the US.  After all, the American starlet is really close to her mum, Doria Radlan, and Harry will do anything he can to make his new bride happy.  As an active humanitarian, Meghan is also planning to not only make positive changes in the UK, but stateside as well.  And as a wedding present to themselves, they are spending an impressive US$16 million to make their dream come true.  Sources say the pair have ‘fallen in love’ with this stunning Italian-style property with dramatic views over the Pacific Ocean.  It has eight bedrooms and eight bathrooms, a large swimming pool, hot tub, waterfalls and koi ponds and is just steps from a private beach.  ‘There’s tonnes of space for entertaining,’ discloses a pal. It also has its own cinema, a state-of-the-art gym, floodlit tennis court (perfect for when sporty Kate comes to stay) and a two-storey guest house.  ‘It’s everything Harry and Meghan could want – and it’s perfect for when they have kids.’  The lovestruck young royal is splurging with the millions he received in inheritance from his mum Princess Diana when he turned 30, in 2014.  And actress Meghan is chipping in some cash too.  ‘They are planning on spending $1 million refurbishing the house to their own tastes,’ explains the pal.  Even before the pair got engaged they decided that they were going to split their time between London and LA.  ‘They toyed with the idea of getting a house in Beverly Hills, but thought it would be much more fun to have a place by the beach,’ they continued.  ‘They plan on spending three or four months a year in Malibu. It means that Meghan gets to see her mum and friends a lot.  ‘In fact, they are trying to convince her mum to move into the guesthouse, so she gets the run of the place when they are away,’ says the source.  ‘Harry has had the cash sitting in his bank account for more than three years now and he always intended to spend it on property.  ‘He knows his mum will approve of the purchase.’  Malibu is home to dozens of celebrities, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Britney Spears, Halle Berry, Mel Gibson and Orlando Bloom.  ‘It’s not grand like the houses Harry is used to in London, but he is mesmerised by the thought of living right next to the sea and somewhere so glamorous and exciting.  ‘Meghan thinks it’s funny because she is the exact opposite. She is used to the Malibu lifestyle, but has to pinch herself that she now gets to live in a palace and is getting married in a castle!’  William is said to be ‘a tad jealous’ that Harry and Meghan are getting a pad in California.  Royal duties for the future king of England would prevent the first-born prince and Kate from spending too much time away from the mother country.  Instead, William and Kate will divide their time between multiple estates across the UK, and use Harry and Meghan as an excuse for the odd cheeky escape from royal duty.  ‘He knows it’s not something that he and Kate could get away with – but they plan on visiting them a lot!’ the source says.  The insider also says that Harry and Meghan will still make London their main home.  ‘But Meghan plans to do a lot of charity work in the US and she and Harry want to have a base in LA so they can host fundraisers and invite Hollywood movers and shakers to contribute. But, also, that Malibu beach house is just a cool place to hang out and get away from the pressures of royal life,’ the source added.  For the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!	0
"Despite being nominated for Vocal Duo of the Year, Faith Hill and Tim McGraw were noticeably absent from the Academy of Country Music Awards on Sunday. Now, we know where they were: in their ""favorite place,"" as Tim captioned a photo with ""his girl"" posted on Monday.  In the Instagram, the couple can be seen canoodling on the water in their bathing suits, likely in the Bahamas, where they own a beautiful vacation home.  The husband and wife appear to be as happy and in love as ever, but of course, internet trolls took issue with the image. In the comments, haters cruelly called the couple ""too thin,"" ""unhealthy,"" and even asked if Tim might be battling an illness or if Faith might have an eating disorder.  ""I've got to say Tim you look really bad. Are you ill?"" asked one person. Another wrote, ""for family and close friends- I'd be concerned and ask if they are ok.... I had a family member who had ED and was hospitalized and very ill.... I don't want that to happen to anyone.""  Fans came to their defense, reminding people that it's ""really NONE of your business,"" and besides, Faith has ""always been thin,"" and that Tim ""is running everyday. And off the alcohol. ""  It's true that Tim has said he quit drinking in 2008 and turned to exercise instead.  ""I got to a point in my career, where it was either time to give up, not try to be the best you can be moving forward or try to be the best that you can be,"" The Boot quoted him as saying in 2016. ""I was at a crossroads in my life on all fronts: I wanted to be healthy, I wanted to be around for my kids, I wanted to be a better husband and a better father, I wanted to take care of myself mentally and physically, and I wanted to get the most out of my career that I could get out of my career.""    Recently, Tim's health made headlines when the country star collapsed on stage due to dehydration. ""I've gotta cut short my workouts,"" the singer said.  Thankfully, positive words about Tim and Faith's strong marriage, great music, and the beautiful moment that was captured drowned out the negative ones."	0

Kanye West is working on new music. We got a taste of what’s coming this weekend, when two full-length tracks (featuring Migos, Young Thug, and ASAP Rocky) plus one snippet surfaced online.  In a recent appearance on Ebro in the Morning, Chance The Rapper noted that Kanye is working with Francis from Francis and the Lights on Ye’s next album. Kanye has also reportedly been working with Pusha T.  According to a previous report from TMZ, Kanye has been doing this work “holed up” somewhere in Wyoming for inspiration. But, according to a new interview with Def Jam CEO Steve Bartels, Kanye may actually be working on the new project in Utah. He's somewhere out west, it appears, but no one seems to know exactly where.  Here is the interaction between Variety and Bartels.  Variety: Let me ask what’s up with several of your artists. Word was that Kanye West was recording by himself somewhere in Utah—is that real?  Bartels: I don’t know if that’s real or not, I read the same things you do. When we talk we don’t really get down to the granular of where he’s going and how he’s flying there, we keep it much more on a broader level. Kanye is working, that’s been widely reported. He’s always very focused, and our relationship with him is that we always have great respect for him and when he’s ready to do something or talk about something, we’re there for him, we totally support his vision and his focus, and that’s where we leave it. I check in with him from time to time just to see how he’s doing. What’s great about our relationship is that I always know when it’s go time—because he wakes me up. [Laughter]  POST CONTINUES BELOW  Bartels did confirm Kanye is working on new music. He was not totally sure of the timeline for the release, however.  “You never know,” Bartels said, when asked if the new music would arrive this year. “He’s always working, so maybe so. It’s never something we’re pushing—it’s always led by the creative side.”  Probably a good approach from Bartels—let Kanye do his thing, and when the project’s done, he’ll let you know. He'll give you a call at 3 a.m.  Bartels also spoke on another Def Jam artist, Justin Bieber, who is quietly killing it right now.  “The remarkable thing about him right now is that he could be having the song of the summer without it being his own record—both the DJ Khaled [‘I’m the One’] and Luis Fonsi [‘Despacito’] records are massive right now, and we’ve got another one coming,” Bartels said. “We’re doing a new release on Friday with Bieber and David Guetta called ‘2U.’ We’ll be working on in conjunction with Warner France—we’ll be taking care of it here. It’s a massive record, and it’s another song that’s gonna compete for song of the summer even though it’s starting later than the other two.”  POST CONTINUES BELOW  Bartels has spent 30 years in the music business (he started as a DJ, and he’s been the Def Jam CEO since 2014), so he knows what he’s doing and how to handle artists. He also spoke on Bieber growing up in the spotlight, Iggy Azalea’s new music, and whether the upcoming releases from Vince Staples and 2 Chainz will step on each other.

    Nearly two years after Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pitt, the former power couple have reached a new temporary custody agreement over their six children for this summer, Us Weekly confirms.  According to court documents obtained by Us, the Superior Court of Los Angeles County determined that “not having a relationship with their father” would be “harmful” to Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 9. The court said that the kids “are safe with their father” and that it is “critical that each of them have a healthy and strong relationship” with both of their parents. However, Maddox is essentially free to go with either parent because of his age.  Jolie, 43, and Pitt, 54, were ordered to arrange a phone call between them, their children and two psychologists “to explain the summer schedule,” the documents state. The Fight Club actor will have physical custody of the minor children (all but Maddox) for four hours a day from June 8 to 17 in London, where the Maleficent actress rents a house. Pitt must spend time with each child at least twice during the 10-day period with one of the psychologists present. Jolie will not be present during her estranged husband’s custodial time.  The Moneyball actor will have custody of the minor children for 10 hours each day from June 27 to July 1 with the other psychologist present. He also has custody for four hours a day from July 8 to 14. Upon his return to Los Angeles, Pitt will have custody of the kids from July 21 to 29. He is responsible for returning them back to Jolie in London on July 29, in addition to paying for their transportation. He will have custody again from August 11 until the estranged couple’s next court hearing on August 13.  In addition, the Tomb Raider actress must provide Pitt with “each of the minor children’s personal cellphone numbers so that [he] may text them,” according to the documents obtained by Us. She cannot monitor the texts.  Jolie and Pitt separated in September 2016. In light of the latest arrangement, a source tells Us, “This [divorce] has been a longstanding back-and-forth, and hopefully now there will be greater collaboration for the benefit of the kids. The kids have always been a priority for both parents and hopefully everyone will comply with the court order going forward. Brad will be wherever he needs to be for the kids.”  A spokesperson for Jolie responded to the release of the custody agreement in a statement to Us on Wednesday, June 13: “This misleading leak is not in the best interests of the children. From the start, Angelina has been focused only on their health and needs, which is why it was so important that this last court hearing be conducted privately. It’s deplorable that someone, for their own selfish reasons, leaked selective portions of the confidential and sealed court record to create an inaccurate and unfair picture of what is really happening.”	1

What's the difference between these two moments? For one thing, I think the audience was supposed to feel uncomfortable with Betty's performance. Betty gets on stage because she feels that she has to in order to ultimately protect her boyfriend, whereas Blair did it because she was feeling sexy and powerful. Earlier in the episode, Toni Topaz (Vanessa Morgan) even calls out the Serpent tradition as sexist and misogynistic. It's quite possible that this scene was not supposed to be titillating at all, but an example of how vulnerable a situation Betty was putting herself in at the time.	1

Prince William and Kate touch down in private plane with George and Charlotte for royal tour The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will spend the day in Warsaw before visiting Gdansk on Tuesday  The royal tour of Poland and Germany has officially begun! Prince William and Kate, and their children Prince George and Princess Charlotte, have touched down in Warsaw for the start of their five-day visit. The Cambridges were the picture of happiness as they disembarked from their private jet at Warsaw airport and walked the red carpet, ready to kick off their European tour.  Kate, 35, was her usual elegant self in a pristine white coat by Alexander McQueen. She carried Charlotte in her arms and expertly navigated the plane steps in her favourite nude high heels, while William held onto three-year-old Prince George, who at first seemed reluctant to disembark from the plane. This is William and Kate's first official joint trip to Poland and Germany; the Duke, also 35, made an official visit to Germany last summer.  CLICK TO VIEW FULL GALLERY  VIEW GALLERY  Kate carried Princess Charlotte in her arms as she arrived in Poland  Many are viewing the royal trip, taken at the request of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office, as another Brexit diplomacy tour, helping to maintain and strengthen the UK's relations with Europe as it leaves the EU. Earlier this year, the Duke and Duchess spent two days in Paris where they met former French President Francois Hollande.  VIEW GALLERY  The little girl was adorable in a red floral frock  Shortly after touching down, the family were escorted to Belweder Palace, about a 20-minute drive away from the airport, where they were greeted by Poland's President Duda and his wife, First Lady Agata. Leaving George and Charlotte at home in the palace with their nanny Maria Borrallo, William and Kate headed to the Warsaw Rising Museum, which is dedicated to the uprising of 1944 which saw the Polish resistance army attempt to liberate Warsaw from German occupation.  VIEW GALLERY  The family are spending two days in Poland  William and Kate's royal tour itinerary revealed!  On Monday, William and Kate will also meet young local entrepreneurs at a reception, followed by a garden party held in honour of the Queen.

George and Charlotte will be seen on a number of occasions, most likely as they arrive and depart from both countries, while William and Kate will have jam-packed days scheduled.	1
S.B. “And hopefully it’ll be successful. When you get down to it, the only way we get to make movies is by making someone some money. If this film doesn’t perform, then it’ll be another political statement. I don’t want that. What would be nice is that if this works, it works because it was a good movie, and that people forget that it was a group of eight women. And then maybe this group of eight women will take on a ninth person, and we’ll be able to do it again. But it all depends on how it performs.”	0
    The real family feud. Khloé Kardashian is speaking her mind about sister Kourtney’s phone addiction in a promo for the Sunday, March 4, finale episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.  In the clip, the two sisters — along with middle sis Kim — are aboard a boat during their trip to San Francisco’s Alcatraz prison when the 33-year-old Strong Looks Better Naked author loses her patience with her oldest sibling.  “What the f—k are you here for?” Khloé fumes as she calls Kourtney out for taking a phone call. “You’re like a waste of space in my meter right now.”  “I’m looking at everything,” the 38-year-old reality star responds, which ultimately just sets Khloé off even more. “You’re annoying as f–k now when we’re together,” Khloé replies. “This is what you do, you’re on your phone the whole time. You’re just not present.”  Meanwhile, Kourtney tries to defend herself asking, “I had a 10 minute conversation with Sarah and that’s offensive?” To which both of her sisters respond, “Yeah.”  Khloé — who is pregnant with her first child — continues to rant: “Yes, because we’re only here once. When are we ever gonna go back to Alcatraz? You know what, actually, I’m not doing this today,” the reality star says between banter with Kourtney. “Because last time in Costa Rica I looked crazy because I’m always complaining to get you guys to have fun. I’m not going to be crazy — you be the f—cking b—ch you [are].”  And Kourtney ended the bickering with a low blow: “F—ck you, you whore. You pregnant whore.”  As previously reported, Us Weekly broke the news in September 2017 that Khloé is expecting her first child with boyfriend Tristan Thompson — a baby boy — this spring. She later confirmed her pregnancy in a sweet Instagram post in December 2017.  Keeping Up With the Kardashians airs on E! Sundays at 9 p.m. ET.	1

Justin Bieber is said to have left behind his American bulldog puppy Karma with a dog trainer in Canada... and hasn't picked her up since February  'This is like taking your kid to school and not picking it back up,' he said.  Bieber's father Jeremy had originally asked Dvernichuk, of Ontario, Canada, to look after Karma for a few weeks and get her trained before taking her to America.  However, the singer has failed to return to get the dog and is said to have not responded to calls to take her back.  He also claimed that the singer has not paid for Karma's upkeep.  Adorable: Karma the puppy - who was named by one of his fans - came into Bieber's life last Christmas  In September, the dog trainer took to his Facebook page, writing: 'Karma is gonna bite you in your ass biebers.'  He posted his comment along with a YouTube video news report about the singer getting his dog back in December 2013.  He later added on his Facebook page: 'More pictures of Karma' up to date pictures...the best behaved American bulldog i've ever had the honor to train...but its time for her to go.'  The Baby hitmaker first got his puppy back at the end of last year for Christmas, picking her up from Ruffin's Pet Centre in Stratford, Ontario.  His dad then asked Bieber's army of fans to come up with a name for her, and they soon settled on Karma.  At the time, Bieber Senior wrote on Twitter: 'So we're gonna let one lucky #belieber name @justinbieber's new puppy.... Follow and find out how it can be you).'  BFFs: Bieber and Mally appeared to be best pals for a while, but Justin soon grew tired of the monkey  He later updated his page with the winner, writing: 'so we have got a name selected for the newest Bieber. Big thanks to @justinfredos the Belieber who chose it "".Karma"" (sic).'  This isn't the first pet that the international superstar has left behind after a brief period of time.  In December 2012, he gave away his pet hamster, Pac, to a random screaming fan at a Jingle Ball concert, making her promise she would 'take care of him'.  Sadly the teenage super-fan didn't turn out to be a very good surrogate parent to Pac, and he went to 'little hamster heaven,' in March 2013.  In June last year, Bieber's Capuchin monkey was seized by German customs officials after the singer brought it on tour to Munich with him without the right vaccination and import paperwork.  He had the opportunity to retrieve 20-month old Mally, but failed to collect him on time and missed a deadline to send the documents, according to customs spokesman Thomas Meister.  Ownership of the animal was then transferred to Germany and he was taken first to a Munich animal shelter and now lives in Serengeti Park near Hanover, which later billed Biebs $8,000 to cover vaccinations, accommodation and transport.  The Munich shelter has previously criticised Bieber for keeping such a young monkey as a pet, saying it shouldn't have been taken away from its mother until it was a year old. Experts say Capuchins also need to be kept in groups, not alone.  A representative for Justin Bieber declined to comment on the matter after being approached."	0
"The US mag story everyone is talking about Star magazine  According to a cover story in US magazine Star today, Jen has allegedly been ""caught out"" planning a get together at the posh US ski destination with her ex Brad, amid the collapse of his marriage and published claims that her own union to actor Justin Theroux is supposedly on thin ice.  ‘They’ve been growing closer ever since Jen reached out to Brad after his split from Ange,’ a source told Star. ‘Jen has been a real source of comfort and strength for Brad, and during their long talks, they realised just how strong their bond still is.’  The publication goes on to claim that the duo have arranged to meet up on a skiing break. While she will be accompanied by close friends, it seems there is room for Brad.  ‘When Jen mentioned that she was planning to go skiing with friends in Aspen after New Year’s, a light bulb went off in Brad’s head,’ claims Star’s source. ‘He said he could fly over in his private jet and meet up with her there.  ‘He pointed out that they could even hit the slopes together, since no one would recognise them in their ski masks, goggles and helmets. Jen thought it was genius.  The magazine claims that Jen has booked a $10,000 a night chalet featuring multiple fireplaces and hot tubs.  ‘The trip is going to be a blast,’ claims the source, who adds, ‘I imagine Brad and Jen will steal private moments to they can have some emotional heart-to-hearts.’  Reps for both Brad and Jen have denied Star’s story, and Jen has long said how happy she is with husband Justin."	0
"George and Amal Clooney famously stepped out for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's royal wedding back in May 2018. But why didn't the Hollywood couple make it Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank's nuptials?  When Harry and Meghan tied the knot, George and Amal had one of the best views of the couple in St. George's Chapel. Sitting in the left choir with Meghan's friends and family, the Clooneys made a big impact at the wedding, and it was thought that they'd also be putting in an appearance at Eugenie and Jack's big day.  However, George and Amal were noticeably absent from the second royal wedding of 2018, which was attended by celebs including Demi Moore, Liv Tyler, Kate Moss and Naomi Campbell.  WPA Pool Getty Images  Despite not attending the wedding, George Clooney knows Princess Eugenie's husband well. Brooksbank became the UK's brand ambassador for Casamigos in 2016, which is a tequila company Clooney co-founded with Cindy Crawford's husband, Rande Gerber. While Gerber and Clooney sold their tequila company for $1 billion in 2017 (per People), it's thought that Clooney and Brooksbank are still friends.  It's now been revealed that Amal was unable to attend Princess Eugenie's wedding because she was giving a talk at the Pennsylvania Conference for Women on the same day:  Ouzounova/Splash / SplashNews.com Splash News  It's unclear why George couldn't make it to Princess Eugenie's royal wedding, but it could have something to do with the actor's current business ventures. Just this week it was announced that Clooney had signed a new TV deal with Paramount. The actor has recently been directing episodes of his new Catch 22 adaptation for the studio, with the series now in post-production.  Despite the Clooneys being absent, Brooksbank previously revealed to the Daily Mail that they'd still be serving tequila at the royal wedding: ""I’m in charge of drinks, and we’ll be serving Casamigos,"" he told them."	1
"Your life just got exponentially better and more stylish now you've signed up for our newsletter. Fabulousness awaits!  It seems Julia Roberts and Danny Moder may be headed for divorce. When the actress took the part of a worker at a secret government facility on Homecoming, an upcoming political thriller on Amazon, she knew just who she wanted as her co-star: her old pal Dermot Mulroney.  She lobbied for him to join the show, and on March 8, it was officially announced that Dermot, 54 — who starred with Julia in My Best Friend's Wedding and August: Osage County — would play her character's boyfriend.  Julia and Dermot. (Photo Credit: Getty Images)  She was thrilled. Her husband? Furious. ""Julia's reunion with Dermot hasn't gone down well with Danny,"" an insider tells Life & Style. ""Even though Julia's reminded him that Dermot is happily married with children, Danny's jealous.""  It's just one of many issues causing problems in Julia and Danny's marriage. The cameraman and cinematographer ""is at the end of his rope,"" the insider tells Life & Style. ""Julia and Danny are constantly quarreling. Their 15-year marriage is on the rocks, and they could even split.""  Julia and Danny have been drifting apart for years. ""Her controlling ways, their different approaches to parenting, and his desire to have his own career, and be the man of the house have all contributed to arguments,"" says the insider. But recently, things have gotten worse. ""They have been living separate lives,"" the insider notes  Julia, Danny, and their three kids in August 2015. (Photo Credit: Getty Images)  Instead of focusing on repairing his marriage to Julia, 50, Danny, 49, ""has been devoting his time to the kids [twins Hazel and Finn, 13, and son Henry, 10], friends, and jobs away from his wife."" When he's home, the insider says, he often stays across the street from their beachfront compound, in a house they bought in 2016 that was originally meant for guests or nannies. The rift is only continuing to grow. ""Julia is a super-protective parent, which has caused friction with Danny, who believes in being more relaxed,"" explains the insider.  But when it comes to other men, he's anything but. When Julia called hunky survivalist Bear Grylls ""a man's man"" after they completed a charity trek across Africa together in 2017, ""that really got under Danny’s skin,"" says the insider. Danny was also seething after his wife turned into what he called a fawning ""sports groupie,"" the insider says, when they spent time with British and Spanish soccer stars at meet-and-greets in 2016 and 2017.  Danny's insecurity extends to his career, too: He hates being seen as Mr. Julia Roberts. ""For a long time, Danny viewed Julia's success as his own failure. It triggered a fear that he was not good enough, and the fact that Julia controls everything at home made it worse,"" explains the insider. ""Feeling insecure and competitive with your partner is no way to live.""  Though they love each other, friends fear they can't go on like this much longer. ""Julia and Danny's marriage is hanging by a thread,"" says the insider. ""Unless they can come to terms with their issues, they're headed for divorce.""

"Nearly two months after Demi Lovato's apparent overdose, her mom, Dianna de la Garza, is breaking her silence.  As for how Demi is doing, Dianna told Newsmax TV, “She's happy. She's healthy. She's working on her sobriety, and she's getting the help she needs. That in itself encourages me about her future and about the future of our family.""  Dianna got permission from Demi before appearing on the news channel where she opened up about her reaction to the apparent overdose. She said, “It's still a really difficult thing to talk about. I literally start to shake a little bit when I start to remember what happened that day.""  Demi’s assistant was the one who called Dianna, who “was in shock” over the news. She added, “I didn't know what to say. It was just something that I never, ever expected to hear, as a parent, about any of my kids.""  After learning that Demi was conscious but not talking, Dianna “knew at that point that we were in trouble.”  Dianna and Demi’s sisters Dallas and Madison rushed to Cedars-Sinai Hospital to see Demi. She shared, “Dallas and Madison and I jumped out of the car at the emergency room and ran into the emergency room to be by her side. She just didn't look good — at all. She was in bad shape. But I said to her, 'Demi, I'm here. I love you.' And at that point she said back to me, 'I love you, too.'""  De la Garza said she relied on faith to get her through. ""From that point on, I never allowed myself to ever think that things weren't going to be okay,"" she said. ""I prayed, of course, all the way to the hospital, and my faith is strong. I think that was one of things that got me through the next couple of days when she was in critical condition. We just didn't know for two days if she was going to make it or not.""  Dianna also showed her appreciation to the doctors and fans, pointing out, “I just feel like the reason she's alive today is because of the millions of prayers that went up that day when everybody found out what was happening. I don't think she would be here if it hadn't been for those prayers and the good doctors and Cedars-Sinai. They were the best. I couldn't have asked for a better team of people to save her life."""	1

"Aaron Carter, 28, (pictured in 2009) filed for bankruptcy in 2013 but says he's not broke  Aaron Carter made more than $200million before he even turned 18 years old, he says.  So when he filed for bankruptcy in 2013 and his financial status was broadcast around the world, it was more than a little humiliating for the pop star.  But he wants the world to know he's not broke.  'I'm not broke. I mean, I don't make all the money in the world right now, but I'm doing the best that I can,' said the 28-year-old.  'I do a lot of shows and I write a lot of music.  'I'm rebuilding my life.  'Over the last 10 years, my story's been really difficult,' he told Oprah on 'Oprah: Where Are They Now - Extra.'  'No one has any idea what happened to me.'  Aaron, the younger brother of Backstreet Boy Nick Carter, shot to fame at age seven.  For the next decade, Aaron toured and made music, all while being managed by his parents.  'I hadn't taken a break. It was almost like 10 years that I had not stopped working for my family,' he says.  Aaron said his finances were better than his boy band brother before the age of 18.  'No disrespect to my brother, but when Nick was 18 years old and I was 10 years old, I was just kind of starting to make lots of money.  'I made over $200million in my career before I even turned 18 years old.  Aaron Carter (pictured, right with his brother Nick in 2000) started singing after Nick became a global phenomenon with the Backstreet Boys  The now-28-year-old says his parents Robert and Jane Carter (pictured with him in 2001) mishandled his millions of dollars when he was a kid and didn't leave him enough money to pay his taxes when he turned 18  'We had this massive compound, with, like, 12 houses on it.  'It was worth over $10million, and I had paid a lot of that money.  'I had done a lot of that stuff, and I never got any of those returns back or anything like that… Even at this point, I've never even owned my own home.'  Aaron claims his parents mishandled his money and neglected his finances.  'There was a lot of neglect on my parents' part,' he says. 'They didn't do a lot of things right.'  Aaron owed $4million in tax liens when he turned 18. He was only given $2million when he became an adult, despite the Coogan law - which is designed to safeguard a portion of child performers' earnings - stating he should have been given about $20million.  Aaron (pictured in 2013) says filing for bankruptcy was embarrassing as it became news and everyone assumed he was broke  Aaron (seen in 2012) says he doesn't blame his parents for their mistakes and has an album due out some time this year  Owing twice as much money as he had, he filed for bankruptcy.  'I was like, ""I don't want to do it because it's embarrassing"", and people are going to be like, ""Aaron Carter's broke"", and all this stuff,' Aaron said.  Aaron says he doesn't blame his parents for their financial mistakes and is now trying to put his life back together. It is not clear what happened to his missing millions."	1

This week on Hollywood Medium, Country music star Brett Eldredge is pretty sceptical about the whole idea of contacting the dead.  However, when he sits down with Tyler his mood seems to change as the medium starts to describe contact with a strong older man, someone who the whole family turns to. A practical man who is good with his hands and has a knack with cars.  This latter point really nails it for Brett as he tells Tyler he did have a grandfather who ran a gas service station for 40 years. He used to teach them how to maintain cars and how to do tasks like changing a tyre.  Talking to the camera Brett says: “I kept saying to myself he’s making this up he’s making this up, but he just hit that…pretty amazing.”  He goes on to say that Tyler “gave him chills and it was a good feeling”.  Also on this episode, Shanola Hampton is given a reading as a gift from her co-star Amy Smart and makes a very deep connection with her late mother.  Brooke Burn also looks to Tyler for some answers about a double tragedy and Tyler finds out something disturbing about Linda Blair’s dog rescue.  Sign up now for your TV newsletter!

He is the recipient of three Golden Globe Awards and two Academy Awards, one for acting in Syriana (2006) and the other for co-producing Argo (2012). In 2018, he was the recipient of the AFI Lifetime Achievement Award.[2]  Clooney made his acting debut on television in 1978, and later gained wide recognition in his role as Dr. Doug Ross on the medical drama ER from 1994 to 1999, for which he received two Primetime Emmy Award nominations. While working on ER, he began attracting a variety of leading roles in films, with his breakthrough role in From Dusk till Dawn (1996),[3][4] and the crime comedy Out of Sight (1998), in which he first worked with director Steven Soderbergh, who would become a long-time collaborator. In 1999, he took the lead role in Three Kings, a well-received war satire set during the Gulf War.  In 2001, Clooney's fame widened with the release of his biggest commercial success, the heist comedy remake Ocean's Eleven, the first of what became a trilogy, starring Clooney. He made his directorial debut a year later with the biographical spy comedy Confessions of a Dangerous Mind, and has since directed the historical drama Good Night, and Good Luck (2005), the sports comedy Leatherheads (2008), the political drama The Ides of March (2011), and the war film The Monuments Men (2014).

"They make much of being devoted sisters.  But Kim Kardashian didn't hold back when she attacked Kourtney and pregnant Khloe's dress sense during a trip to Japan, calling them 'f***ing clowns'.  In a new clip from Sunday's upcoming episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians she sat her sisters down and told them: 'So I gotta be real with you guys. You look like f***ing clowns.'  Kim Kardashian tells Kourtney and pregnant Khloe 'you look like f***ing clowns' as she attacks their dress sense in KUWTK  Clowns? Kim attacked her sisters outfits during their Japan trip  'Oh!' replied her sisters, in obvious shock.  Kim was unrepentant. 'I'm not f***ing kidding. This is not like a tourist thing where it's Halloween, dress up like a f***ing Japanese geisha.'  Defending herself, Kourtney said: 'I thought my hair looked good last night and I thought my outfit was fun for Japan.'  Can you believe her? Khloe and Kourtney looked bemused at Kim's remarks  'You can be cooler': Kim didn't hold back when blasting her sisters  But Kim wasn't having it. 'Your outfit would have been great if you didn't have like blue eyeshadow.  'You have to tell the glam people. Everyone just thinks ""Let's go full Japan"" and probably the people that live here make fun of people like that.'  While her sisters had at first smiled at Kim's words, they grimaced as she added: 'I am literally cropping myself out.'

Kim then decreed: 'I'm not telling you who to be or what to wear or anything. But I'm telling you who to be and what to wear. It could be time for a fashion overhaul so that you stay young and relevant.'  While Kim's comments may seem mean, she has said far worst in the past.

Swift's nightly choices have run the gamut from fan favorite ""All Too Well"" to career throwback ""Teardrops on My Guitar.""  While most of Swift's performance is based on the main stage, she makes her way back to two smaller B-stages, giving more fans a chance to see her up close. There, she performs ""Shake It Off,"" ""Dancing With Our Hands Tied,"" ""Blank Space"" and ""Dress"" -- as well as the surprise song of the night on acoustic guitar.

In honor of her milestone birthday, she is the cover girl on InStyle where she gets candid about specific aspects of joy. Roberts has been married to her husband, Danny Moder for 15 years and they have three children together, Phinnaeus, Henry, and Hazel.  During the interview, she admitted three keys to joy she’s fortunate to have: “Marry the right person, give birth to a redhead, and have great girlfriends.”  The redhead is oldest son Phinneaus, who is called Finn. He and twin sister Hazel are 12 years old.  Roberts is also transitioning from the big screen to television as she’s producing and starring in Amazon’s upcoming project Homecoming, which is based on the popular podcast by the same name. She admits to being nervous about the differences as she’s never done television before. She talks about how the quality of television has almost surpassed film in many ways: “I don’t want to go against my peoples, but it sort of is. There’s a lot of really good content and a lot of diversity.” The series begins filming next year.  As a woman in this industry, she does feel an interesting bit of introspection about the fact that everyone seems to be asking her about turning 50. Despite loving her birthday and the blessings of a new year, she can’t help but think so many people are making a big deal out of it because she is a woman.  “Did anyone ever go over this with George Clooney or Brad [Pitt] before their 50th birthdays?” She joked.  Advertisement  It turns out that they do. The Today Show made a big deal of Pitt’s 50th back in 2013.	1
Justin Bieber's father might have been the one marrying his longterm girlfriend Chelsey Rebelo on Monday in Jamaica, but it looks like the 23-year-old singer and Selena Gomez were the most-loved up on the day.  During the wedding reception in Montego Bay, Bieber and Gomez were spotted kissing and cuddling, stealing moments away from the other guests to be alone, before changing into beachwear, lounging around the resort and sipping cocktails.  Backgrid  For the nuptials, Bieber was seen walking down the aisle in a white collared short sleeved shirt, pink shorts, and a colour coordinated bow tie.  Meanwhile, Selena wore a peach floral wrap dress and her long brown locks pinned up into a loose undo.  His mother-in-law Chelsey later posted a photograph of the nuptials with the caption: 'Yesterday was the most amazing day ever. I married my best friend! I love you!'  The day before the big day, Selena and Justin were spotted by eagle-eyed fans having a cuddly moment together on the beach. In the snap, the Texan beauty can be seen putting an affectionate hand on the back of the 'Sorry' singer's neck.  Over the weekend, People reports Bieber made a three-hour detour flight to pick up his girlfriend in Texas to fly to Jamaica.  'Justin picked up Selena in a private jet, and they arrived first thing in the morning to Montego Bay. They spent the day with Justin's family at a resort catching up and getting ready for Jeremy and Chelsey to get married,' says a source.  Hours later, the 'Bad Liar' songstress was seen posing for selfies with Bieber's cousins.  'Selena was very comfortable with Justin's family. She was hugging some of them and seemed right at home,' a source told the publication.  'She and Justin ate lunch together and packed on the PDA. They were kissing and hugging throughout the morning. He rubbed sunscreen all over her back and they enjoyed the pool and being outside.'  The white (and pink) wedding comes days after the couple spent Valentine's Day in Beverley Hills together following their pre-Valentine's Day weekend trip to Laguna Beach.	1
"Howie Mandel wasn't invited to the royal wedding — but he has no hard feelings.  In fact, he doesn't really have any feeling about Meghan Markle at all, since he doesn't even remember her from their Deal or No Deal days.  Though Meghan, 37, was a model on the game show that Howie hosted, the 63-year-old told Dr. Oz this week that he had no recollection of working with her, and it came as a surprise when he learned the Duchess of Sussex was on the show.  Nope! Howie Mandel said this week that he wasn't invited to the royal wedding  Blending in: The 63-year-old also admitted he didn't remember Meghan Markle  Rising star: Meghan worked as a 'suitcase girl' on Deal or No Deal at the start of her acting career, between 2006 and 2007  Beautiful ladies: The two definitely met, though it doesn't seem like the future Duchess made an impression on Howie  In a preview clip of an episode of The Dr. Oz Show set to air on Thursday, Howie dishes as best he can on Meghan — which is to say, he doesn't really dish at all.  'I was not invited to the wedding,' he says, answering Dr. Oz's question.  When prodding to share what he recalls of working together — Meghan was on the show briefly in the mid-2000s — Howie didn't have much to tell.  'What do I remember? I'm going to be totally honest with you. Nothing. I don't remember Meghan. I don't,' he said.  Gesturing to a photo of Meghan as a briefcase girl, Howie said, 'I saw that picture when she became the Duchess or when she got engaged.  'I saw that picture and they went, ""She was a Deal or No Deal model,"" and I go, ""Really? Really? What number?"" Then that picture, put up that picture again, as I was trying to remember, what number was she? There's no number even on her case. So, how do you know she was actually a model?  'I think she's just a young lady with a lot of baggage,' he joked.  Working the camera: The now-37-year-old was one of 26 women who had to carry a suitcase that was filled with a monetary amount, ranging between one penny and $1 million  Exciting: Her go-to briefcase number was 24, and she knew how to nail the necessary excitement for players who eliminated small dollar amounts  Surprise! Meghan appeared on the show ten years before she met Prince Harry, and said in 2013 that she did it in order to 'make ends meet' while auditioning for other roles  Meghan carried briefcases with more than one number during her time, but it was most frequently the number 24.  Speaking about her more, Howie had some generic, nice things to say.  'She's a wonderful, beautiful, young lady and I'm so happy for her. All I want for each and every person, they don't even have to be on my show to be successful and healthy,' he said.  When asked about Meghan at a Television Critics Association event in August, Howie joked that she was 'slightly duchessy' before praising all the women who held up the briefcases on the show.  'Not everybody will have the opportunity to meet royalty, but these are all accomplished people that have something substantial — they’re not just standing there holding a case,' he said.  'They have careers, they have hobbies, they have families, they’re entrepreneurial—they’re all people. So, when somebody like Harry meets somebody who just happened to be on our show, there’s a lot to offer.'  Revealed: Chrissy Teigen, 33, said she was on Deal or No Deal when Meghan was, and had only nice things to say about her  No big: Howie doesn't seem to crushed about not getting an invite  Diva?He did, however, joke that she was 'duchessy' earlier this year  'Definitely working on Deal or No Deal was a learning experience, and it helped me to understand what I would rather be doing,' she said  Meghan, meanwhile, reflected on her time on the show in a 2013 interview with Esquire.  'Definitely working on Deal or No Deal was a learning experience, and it helped me to understand what I would rather be doing,' she said, adding that it was 'in the category of things I was doing while I was audition"	1

Selena Gomez checked into a treatment center, and RadarOnline.com has the exclusive details about her latest rehab stint.  Justin Bieber’s 25-year-old girlfriend spent the last two weeks of January in a New York area treatment center and a source explained that those close to her were afraid of a drug relapse.  “Selena’s inner circle is afraid she is back on drugs and racing toward a breakdown,” the insider told Radar.  PHOTOS: Selena Gomez & Ex Justin Bieber’s ‘Tense’ Reunion Two Years After Split  The singer’s party lifestyle was enabled by her boyfriend, the informant claimed.  “The label just gave her another huge advance which, mixed with Justin’s resources — he’s covering her security and transportation — has led to some pretty heavy partying…even for her.”  Gomez cut off her mother, Mandy Teefey, in the middle of her latest breakdown.  PHOTOS: Selena Gomez & Justin Bieber Caught On Sweet Church Date After Intimate Reunion  “Selena changed her number again in an effort to avoid Mandy. Mandy is now speaking to Selena through Justin and his mother,” the insider snitched to Radar.  Another source revealed Gomez sought treatment for “depression and anxiety.”  “Selena doesn’t want to fall back into her old ways,” the insider said. “She wants to be proactive about staying healthy.”  PHOTOS: Selena Gomez & Justin Bieber’s Nasty Jabs At Her Ex The Weeknd  As Radar previously reported, Gomez checked into rehab in 2016 to battle her demons.  An insider revealed that Gomez had begun using a potentially deadly cocktail of “Lunesta, Ambien, Klonopin and Xanax” before loved ones staged a desperate intervention and checked her into rehab.  “Everyone close to her is worried because she seems to be back to old behavior,” said the source of Gomez, who also did a previous stint in treatment back in 2014.

"Janet Jackson called the police asking for a welfare check on her 1-year-old son, Eissa Al Mana, who was in the care of his father at the time. A watch commander with the Malibu County Sheriff's Office told ET that Jackson called shortly before 10 p.m. on Sunday and asked them to check on Jackson's son, who was staying with his father at the Nobu Hotel. The baby's father is billionaire Wissam Al Mana, Jackson's estranged husband.  Jackson's brother, Randy Jackson, told ET that Janet called 911 after a nanny told her that she was frightened by Wissam's behavior, which she thought was aggressive. Randy said that the nanny was so scared she locked herself in a bathroom so she could call the singer.  Janet Jackson and Wissam Al Mana married in 2012. They had their son on Jan. 2, 2017 and broke up three months later. They said they would be co-parenting their child.  Jackson announced in 2016 that she was delaying her ""Unbreakable"" tour to plan a family with her husband. The singer, who was 49 at the time, said, ""My husband and I are planning our family, so I'm going to have to delay the tour. Please, if you can, try to understand that it's important that I do this now. I have to rest up; doctor's orders. But I have not forgotten about you.""  In November, a source told ET that the couple were committed to parenting together, but had no plans of reconciliation.  ""All Janet wants to do is move forward and be the best mother to her son and to be happy,"" the source added at the time."	1
If you’ve been following along on Instagram, then you know that Team LC took a trip to New York this past week for Fashion Week. We’ve covered Fashion Week in the past and it’s always been a blast. This season, Lauren had her own runway show for her limited edition LC Lauren Conrad Runway Collection. It was the first time Lauren has ever had a show at NYFW, and it was literally a dream come true for all of us! The collection was even more beautiful than we could have imagined, and we were so proud of all the hard work that Lauren put into it. Being there to share in the experience had to be one of our favorite moments since we launched LaurenConrad.com almost five years ago.  So today we wanted to give you a behind-the-scenes peek at Lauren’s runway show in the form of a fun little Photo Diary. We hope you’ll feel like you were right there alongside us!  We arrived in New York a few days before the show to prep. Lauren spent the week leading up to the show doing model castings, fittings, walk-throughs of the space, and more. You can’t beat that NYC skyline, can you?  Here we are living that hotel life, and flipping through Lauren’s October Cosmo cover story of course…  The night of the show everything was a buzz. Here are just some of the hundreds of fresh blooms that decorated the runway…  Meanwhile the models were getting into hair and makeup backstage…  Lauren’s makeup artist Amy Nadine designed the soft and pretty makeup look you saw on all the girls, and Kristin Ess created the beautiful braided hair concept…  And let’s not forget the rose gold manicures…  There were charts backstage to help the dressers get each model into the correct looks…  And Team LC had backstage passes to see how everything was coming together so beautifully…  Before the show began Lauren did a first look at all the models…  She was pretty excited for the show to start (we all were!)…  The show itself was a dream… And when Lauren walked out on the runway at the end, we were all so proud of her. Lauren worked tirelessly on this collection, and it turned out beautifully! (We immediately started shopping the collection on our phones.)  After that, it was time to celebrate! We had a big team dinner at Beauty & Essex with all of Lauren’s friends and family…  Where we sipped on these delicious cocktails…  The next day Lauren did The Meredith Viera Show (you can tune in next month)…  And here’s a close-up of her LC Lauren Conrad Runway Collection outfit…  We hope you enjoyed this behind-the-scenes look at Lauren’s runway show.

"Wearing a crown isn't as easy as it looks — just ask Britain's Queen Elizabeth II.  In a rare interview for the documentary ""The Coronation"" on the Smithsonian Channel, Her Majesty discussed the ""disadvantages"" of wearing one.  The 91-year-old monarch noted the Imperial State Crown, which she wore during her coronation ceremony on June 2, 1953, is so heavy ""your neck would break off.""  ""Fortunately, my father and I have about the same sort of shaped head, but once you put it on, it stays. I mean, it just remains itself,"" Her Majesty said of the diamond-encrusted crown that King George VI also wore during his coronation on May 12, 1937. ""You can't look down to read the speech, you have to take the speech up. Because if you did your neck would break, it would fall off.""  Queen Takes Train 175 Years After 1st Royal Ride  Queen Elizabeth and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, marked the 175th anniversary of the first train journey by a British monarch with a train trip from Slough to London’s Paddington Station. (Published Tuesday, June 13, 2017)  She then added, ""So, there are some disadvantages to crowns, but otherwise, they're quite important things.""  Queen Elizabeth II Gives Rare Insight Into Her 1953 Coronation  The Queen also revealed how ""horrible"" it was to ride to the ceremony at Westminster Abbey in the four-ton gold coach.  ""It's not meant for traveling in at all. I mean it's only sprung on leather. Not very comfortable. It can only go at walking pace. The horses couldn't possibly go any faster. It's so heavy,"" the Queen said.  Still, the monarch rode in the Gold State Carriage for nearly five miles that day.  This is the first interview the Queen has given throughout her six-decade reign. In fact, she's the only member of the royal family who has never sat down for a formal interview.  ""The Coronation"" will air in the U.S. on Jan. 14 at 8 p.m. ET on the Smithsonian Channel. It was made in partnership with the BBC and Australian Broadcasting Corporation and is part of the Royal Collection Season, a collaboration between the BBC and Royal Collection Trust.  © Copyright E!

"After several months of the couple trying and failing to keep their relationship on the down-low, we now know that Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx are dating.  We still don't know exactly how long the actors have been together, but it seems they're moving very quickly.  Despite the fact that Foxx doesn't even tell his friends about Holmes (The man is seriously committed to maintaining his privacy.), sources say the relationship is already very serious.  In fact, sources are now claiming that there's a very good reason Holmes and Foxx decided to finally go public with their relationship last week.  According to Australian tabloid NW, Holmes and Foxx are expecting a child together.  Insiders tell the magazine that the pregnancy was planned, and Katie is roughly three months along.  ""Katie had always wanted to have another baby and knew her biological clock was ticking - and, at long last, it's happening!"" says one source.  Noting that Holmes described the pregnancy as ""perfect timing,"" the insider adds:  ""Katie's always wanted a sibling for Suri and now she'll have a little sister.""  We'll hold off on offering out congratulations until the news comes from a source that's slightly more credible than a random Australian tabloid.  That said, we wouldn't be surprised if it turns out there's some truth to these reports.  After all, Katie and Jamie are both devoted parents, and sources close to the couple have confirmed their relationship is very serious.  Plus, after the experience of having a child with Tom Cruise, we imagine Katie would like to find out what child-rearing is like when you're not under 24-hour surveillance from a cabal of cult leaders.  Just kidding, Scientologists! Please don't sue us!  Anyway, sources say that in the years after her split from Cruise, Katie pretty much holed up and devoted herself thoroughly to being a mom.  These days, she's loosening up a bit, and her loved ones credit Foxx with teaching her how to relax and have fun.  “She was a homebody,” says one insider.  “It’s great to see her out and having fun, and I bet Jamie has played a big part in that.”  Hopefully, the knowledge that everyone will now be scrutinizing her midsection in search of a baby bump won't stop Katie from continuing to go out and enjoy herself."	0
"Congrats to Bobby Cannavale and Rose Byrne!  The couple has welcomed their second child together, according to multiple reports.  Byrne confirmed she was pregnant in an interview with Australia's Jones magazine in August.  ""I'm a little tired but feeling good,"" she told the publication at the time, after a photo shoot with her brother, George Byrne. ""Everyone was very sweet on set today, and you always get a little bit more attention when you're pregnant, which is fabulous.""  RELATED: Rose Byrne and Bobby Cannavale Expecting Baby No. 2  Cannavale, 47, and Byrne, 38, who have been dating since 2012, are already parents to nearly 2-year-old son Rocco.

    Real Housewives of Atlanta star Kim Zolciak and her daughter Brielle Biermann are causing quite the stir on social media this week.  Celebrity Babies of 2017  Early on Wednesday — five days after Zolciak came under fire for telling Brielle to flash a breast on Snapchat — the 20-year-old took to Twitter with an announcement.  “OMG!!! i’m so excited my mom is PREGNANT with baby number 7!!!! Brielle wrote in a now-deleted tweet. When a fan asked when Zolciak is due, Brielle responded, “in the spring sometime.”  Brielle then shared the news on Instagram with the caption: “OMG!!! i can’t wait to meet the little nugget. it’s been so hard keeping this a secret!!! woo!! #lucky7.”  A few minutes later, Zolciak, 39, shut down the story on Snapchat. “Brielle’s lying!” she said. “She’s lying!”  But it’s not a totally farfetched story. Just last month, Zolciak told Us Weekly that she and NFL husband Kroy Biermann talk about expanding their family.  Stars Who Got Their Start on Reality TV  “I would love to have another little boy,” she told Us. “I am just obsessed with my boys.” The Don’t Be Tardy star added: “I’m about to be 40 so I would like to hurry up if we’re going to do it, but I definitely think about it a lot.”  And during an October appearance on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, Zolciak revealed she missed breast-feeding and snuggling a newborn. “I have baby fever so bad,” she admitted. Kroy, 32, was on the same page. Quipped the dad: “Never say never.”  Meanwhile, Zolciak cleared up the breast flashing incident in a statement to Us Weekly on Tuesday. “The private snap that everyone is freaking out about was supposed to be private,” she wrote. “But I accidentally sent it to everyone.”  Zolciak also wants the world to know she didn’t confirm Khloé’ Kardashian’s pregnancy.  “The conversation we were having was with my friend Chloe, AGAIN not Khloe Kardashian,” Zolciak said. “Everyone needs to stop putting words in my mouth and making it out to be something that was never confirmed nor talked about.”	1
"Jerry O'Connell is admittedly a little bummed that he didn't get the co-hosting job with Kelly Ripa, but he wasn't surprised.  The actor sat down on KTLA and revealed that he knew he wasn't going to land the gig even before Ryan Seacrest was named co-host. Still, he has nothing but kind words for the Live! show, Seacrest and Ripa, too.  ""I co-hosted the Live! With Kelly, now Live! With Kelly and Ryan show… I love her. It's just, there's really nothing like it. It just happens right there. The prep time is not a lot,"" he said. ""There's something super fun about it, and I've said it before and I'll say it again, doing it with her, Kelly's the best!"""	0
"Ben Affleck made his arrival into the Big Apple looking comfortable in a pair of jeans, grey T-shirt and navy blue jacket on Saturday.

Unless you’re a morning person bestowed with the gift of waking up gracefully and unperturbed, chances are high your a.m. routine may be more of the rushing variety. What’s the harm in just a few more glorious moments of slumber, after all? Well, for one, the state of your hair, which is usually a dead giveaway of a hurried, harried morning. Though model-off-duty strands are having a moment right now, there’s a fine line between artfully tousled and tousled by your pillow; luckily, you don’t have to sacrifice finesse the next time you press snooze (for the third time). Ahead, you’ll find seven quick and easy hairstyles that will take three minutes or less to execute—leaving more time for your sweet, sweet dreams.  Keep scrolling to see them all!  Triple Twisted Pony  Twist Me Pretty  Give your go-to low pony a chic update with this twisted, teased variation. Divide your hair into three sections—left, middle, and right—and then twist the middle section toward the right, pinning it in place. Twist the left section toward the right and pin in place, and then twist the right section toward the left and pin in place over the other two sections. Give it a little tease, and be on your way.  The Half-Up Knot  Treasures and Travels  It doesn’t get easier than this knotted half-updo. Take one two-inch section of hair on either side of your head and gather them together in the back. Twist the sections together as one, twist it into a knot, and then tuck the ends under and pin them in place.  Undone Braid  Refinery 29  A genius way to wear your curly hair down and out of your face, this hairstyle involves melding two french braids into one.  Braided Half-Crown  Barefoot Blonde  Braid a two-inch section of hair on either side of your face, and secure each end with a mini hair elastic (a spritz of Oribe Texturizing Spray, $46, won’t hurt either). Then, just cross each braid over the other and tuck the ends out of sight. Pin everything in place, and flaunt your princess-worthy hair just like Barefoot Blonde.  Double Mini Buns  Hair Romance  This easy hairstyle is perfect for medium-length curly hair. Split your hair into two sections, and curl each one into a mini bun. Pin them in place, and breeze out the door.  The Pineapple  Diversity in Film and TV  We’ve reported on the pineapple hairstyle before as a way to keep natural curls springy while you sleep, but it’s also a chic (and quick) way to wear your hair up during the daytime.  Cool-Girl Chignon  Justin Coit  Created by our own resident hair expert, Jen Atkin, this low bun is the cool girl’s version of a classic chignon.  Barette Bun  The easiest way to step up your hair game when you’re short on time? Add a hair accessory. We’re partial to this matte black barrette, or a diamond-studded phrase like the Kitsch X Justine Marjan Rhinestone Glam Bobby Pin ($29).  The Double-Knotted Pony  Les Èclaireuses  Before you start, know this: This hairstyle works best on those with fine, thin strands.

"British acting royalty Matt Smith and Lily James have become quite the hot couple of the acting scene ever since going public with their relationship back in 2015, but how did Lily James and Matt Smith meet, exactly? Well, despite making their first public appearance as an official couple at the Cinderella premiere in Milan three years ago, the love between the Doctor Who and Mamma Mia: Here We Go Again stars actually began to blossom a year prior.  The pair were first introduced back in 2014 whilst working on the set of Pride and Prejudice and Zombies, as Grazia reports, and speculation of a romantic relationship between Smith and James first emerged after the Mirror reported they were spotted together at the 2014 Cannes Film Festival. Shortly after the festival, rumours which hinted at a budding relationship between the actors only intensified after being photographed together once again, this time in London, as the Daily Mail reported.  These outings were the first time Smith and James had been romantically linked to anyone after the break up of their previous relationships with actress and model Daisy Lowe and actor Jack Fox, respectively, however it appears both have clearly moved on as they enjoy their third year together — which in celebrity terms, could be considered a lifetime.  Kevin Winter/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  Since they began dating the couple have enjoyed continued success in the world of acting, seen recently in Smith's Emmy Award nominated portrayal of Prince Philip in The Crown, and James' role in the Oscar-winning Darkest Hour. However, it's the recent juicy engagement rumours surrounding the two that have really got fans talking.  After displaying a huge diamond ring, as Metro reported, which just so happened to be placed on her engagement finger at the 2018 BAFTA Awards, speculation of potential nuptials was sent into overdrive. And boyfriend Smith added more fuel to the rumour-mill fire whilst speaking on BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs when he revealed he was open to the idea of having children, and soon. The 35-year-old said ""I am thinking about kids quite a lot. I’d like a lot of them.""  Kevin Winter/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  However, those rooting for a fairytale wedding in the near future were left disappointed after James briefly addressed the engagement rumours in an interview with Porter Edit. When discussing the supposed ""engagement"" ring she showed off on the BAFTAs red carpet, Lily said ""I’m just not very superstitious about rings. It’s stupid, probably, but I just put rings on any finger... I mean, Jesus. That ring’s worth one million pounds…""  Although I wouldn't dust off your wedding hats just yet, the current lack of any plans to tie the knot isn't to say there won't be wedding bells in the future. In a recent interview with Marie Claire, James expressed the possibility of herself and Smith buying a home together when she said, ""We want to get somewhere"", and continued ""That's going like, 'Can we go furniture shopping?' We bought a rug...and I love getting flowers and making things look nice.""  So, even though marriage might not be on the cards just yet, the prospect of an engagement between this couple sounds like it could be well on the way. Though for now it sounds like they're having lots of fun together. In James' interview with Porter, she also explained how she nearly missed Glastonbury for her Mamma Mia audition, with the clash causing a ""real argument"" between the couple. At least it all worked out for the best."	1

On February 1, Beyoncé announced she was pregnant with twins via an Instagram photo and a complete maternity photoshoot. The Internet lost its mind; the photo became the record-breaking most-liked post on Instagram, and Twitter took off with memes and GIFs. Though the fanfare following her birth announcement might have been the biggest Hollywood has seen, Bey is joining a group of famous mothers of twins, which will now also include Amal Clooney. One of said mothers, Jennifer Lopez—who has nine-year-old twins Emme and Max with ex-husband Marc Anthony—is here to offer some advice to her fellow star, per Page Six.  “Nothing can prepare you for twins,” she cautioned at the premiere of her NBC series Shades of Blue. “I certainly was not prepared. I would say, ‘Stay calm.’ ”  Her advice is simple but sound. Zoe Saldana, whose twin sons Cy and Bowie Perego-Saldana are two, shared a story with E! News in January that proves raising twins is no task for the faint of heart. She said bedtime alone is a bilingual whirlwind.  “One is more into talking in Spanish. The other is expressing himself more in English,” she added. “One is like, ‘No quiero! No quiero!’ And the other is like, ‘I don't wanna!’ You're like, ‘It's time to go to sleep,’ and they’re both yelling at you all these things. And when they start fighting, they just look like two lads at a pub fighting over like the wrong girl, too. It's like, ‘Ugh!’ It's just vicious. ‘You guys are only two; this is horrible.’ ”  After Celine Dion gave birth to her twins Nelson and Eddy Angelil in 2010, she shared those early days in a special interview in her home on the Oprah Show. Still in her pajamas as she rocked her newborns, the new mother shared her secret to parenting multiples.  “Me, I’m extremely fortunate because I have a lot, a lot, a lot, a lot of help,” the singer said as her mother and sister joined the room to tend to the sleepy babies and allow Dion to pour her morning coffee.  Fortunately for Beyoncé, Tina Knowles Lawson seems to already be on board in the role of proud grandmother.	1
National Treasure is a 2004 film that follows Benjamin Franklin Gates, a man whose family has a history of searching for a near-limitless treasure, one his father (and just about everyone else) believes is a mystery. When he finally discovers a real clue, he must protect it, the treasure, and a precious national document from his former partner.  The greatest adventure history has ever revealed. taglines  Dialogue [ edit ]  [In 1974 John Adams Gates tells the story of a mysterious treasure to a young Ben Gates] John Adams Gates: OK, here we go. It was 1832, on a night much like this. Charles Carroll was the last surviving signer of the Declaration of Independence. He was also a member of a secret society known as the Masons, and... he knew he was dying. He woke up his stable boy in the middle of the night and ordered him to take him to the White House to see Andrew Jackson because it was very urgent that he speak to the President. Ben Gates: Did he talk to him? John Adams Gates: No. He never got the chance. The President wasn't there that night, but Charles Carroll had a secret. So he took into his confidence the one person he could: my grandfather's grandfather, Thomas Gates. Ben Gates: What was his secret? John Adams Gates: A treasure! A treasure beyond all imagining. A treasure that had been fought over for centuries by tyrants, pharaohs, emperors, warlords. And every time it changed hands, it grew larger. And then, suddenly, [snaps his fingers] it vanished. It didn't reappear for more than a thousand years when knights from the First Crusade found hidden vaults beneath the Temple of Solomon. You see, the knights who found the vaults believed that the treasure was too great for any one man, not even a king. They brought the treasure back to Europe and took the name... the Knights Templar. Over the next century, they smuggled it out of Europe and formed a new brotherhood known as the Freemasons, in honor of the builders of the Great Temple. War followed. By the time of the American Revolution, the treasure had been hidden again. By then, the Masons came to include George Washington, Benjamin Franklin, Paul Revere. They knew they had to make sure the treasure would never fall into the hands of the British, so they devised a series of clues and maps to its location. Over time the clues were lost or forgotten, until only one remained. And that was the secret that Charles Carroll entrusted to young Thomas Gates. Charles Carroll: Charlotte. Ben Gates: Who's Charlotte? John Adams Gates: Oh, not even Mr. Carroll knew that. Now, look here, Ben. The Freemasons among our Founding Fathers left us clues [takes out one-dollar bill] like these. The unfinished pyramid, the all-seeing eye. Symbols of the Knights Templar, guardians of the treasure. They are speaking to us through these. Patrick Gates: You mean laughing at us. You know what that dollar represents: the entire Gates family fortune. Six generations of fools... chasing after fool's gold. John Adams Gates: It's not about the money, Patrick. It's never been about the money! Patrick Gates: Come on, son. Time to go. You can say your goodbyes.  [Sadusky and Ben discuss the reward for finding the treasure] Agent Sadusky: Just like that? Ben: Just like that. Agent Sadusky: You know that you've just handed me your biggest bargaining chip. Ben: The Declaration of Independence is not a bargaining chip. Not to me. Agent Sadusky: Have a seat. So what's your offer? Ben: Oh, how about a bribe? Say, ten billion dollars? Agent Sadusky: I take it you found the treasure. Ben: It's about five stories beneath your shoes. Agent Sadusky: Hm. You know, the Templars and the Freemasons believed the treasure was too great for any one man to have, not even a king. That's why they went to such great lengths to keep it hidden. Ben: That's right. The Founding Fathers believed the same thing about government. I figure their solution will work for the treasure, too. Agent Sadusky: Give it to the people. Ben: Di	1
George Clooney and Amal Clooney are not headed for a split, despite a bogus tabloid report alleging that distance is taking a toll on the couple’s marriage. Gossip Cop can exclusively debunk the supposed marital drama. We’re told there’s no truth to it.  Earlier this week, George and Amal celebrated her 40th birthday with a 24-hour getaway to Big Sur, California, but according to OK!, the spouses bickered throughout the entire trip. A so-called “source” tells the magazine, “They had an explosive fight just before they left, and they may have even cut the trip short because of it.”  © Gossip Cop (Getty Images)  The outlet’s questionable insider claims the couple’s relationship has been negatively impacted by time apart and busy work schedules, further contending that the actor has been “holed up” at their house in England working on his upcoming Hulu series, “Catch-22.” “George has felt a tremendous amount of pressure with his new project,” adds the suspicious source. “Amal started resenting his mood swings. She doesn’t see work stress as an excuse to act out.”  The seemingly phony tipster goes on to say that George is also having trouble adjusting to fatherhood and caring for twin babies, and he’s frustrated with “seeing how well [Amal] balances work and home life.” The “insider” adds, “George doesn’t want this to end in divorce. He and Amal are both hoping they can get back on solid ground.”  But Gossip Cop checked in with a source close to the Clooneys, who exclusively assures us there’s no truth to the tabloid’s account of the couple’s marriage, which we’re told is going strong. The actor and human rights lawyer never fought during her birthday trip either. Also, George gushed about his wife during a recent interview on David Letterman’s new Netflix show, “My Next Guest Needs No Introduction.” Regardless, Gossip Cop can confirm that OK!’s article is entirely fabricated.  It’s worth noting, Gossip Cop frequently calls out the publication for pretending to have insight into George and Amal’s marriage. In December, we busted the magazine for wrongly reporting that the spouses were expecting another set of twins just six months after the birth of their baby boy and girl. Naturally, this latest article alleging the Clooneys are having marriage problems fails to mention what happened to the new twins. Simply put, it’s all fiction.

"Gabrielle Union gets real about rape, relationships in her new book  Gabrielle Union wasn't wrong about needing more vino.  In We're Going to Need More Wine, out Tuesday, Union gets real about everything from losing her virginity to anxiety and her career.  Here are a few key takeaways:  1. She has personal stories on rape and breast cancer  There are reasons why Union advocates for victims of sexual assault and is an activist for women's reproductive health, and they're deeply personal. In More Wine, Union opens up about her violent rape at the hands of a gunman while working in a Payless shoe store when she was just 19. The emotional essay delves into the paranoia and fear she experienced post-attack, but also focuses on the safe space of the UCLA Rape Crisis Center where she found a community of survivors.  The final essay in the book focuses on her friendship with childhood friend Sookie Martinez, who died after her stage four metastatic breast cancer diagnosis. She explained that her friend's diagnosis is part of why she's an active supporter of Planned Parenthood and its breast health care. In a tear-jerking moment, she describes asking her friend what she wants her legacy to be, to which Martinez responds, ""I want you to tell people that fear can kill you. I was afraid, and it killed me."" Cue sobbing.  2. She has some great (and sad) relationship stories  Union lays it all out in the open when discussing her first marriage to former NFL player Chris Howard. She says she found out Howard was cheating on her the day after he proposed, saying she threw her engagement ring at him but went on to marry him anyway. Claiming he became ""a prolific cheater"" as their marriage progressed, Union says she participated in a ""sting"" operation when a woman Howard was having an affair with threatened to go public. It's not surprising this chapter of the book is called ""Crush-and-Burn Marriage.""  She also divulges details about crushes and sexual experiences throughout her life, including losing her virginity in a guy's parents' bedroom and dating former NBA player Jason Kidd when they were in high school.)  3. There's an amazing Prince anecdote  Union has an entire essay dedicated to a series of stories about her experiences with the late, great Prince, and they're just as incredible as you would imagine. Her first invite to a Prince soiree resulted in her casually conversing with Mariah Carey, Mary J. Blige and Whitney Houston, and later talking to ""Mr. Prince"" about tuna casserole.  She credits Prince for unwittingly connecting her with her future basketball hubby Dwyane Wade, and providing inclusive spaces for creatives of all creeds and colors.  ""I grieve the vital connector who brought so many communities together, long after he recorded those radio hits everyone knows by heart,"" she writes.  4. She gets real about her blackness and color-ism  From being called racial slurs in middle and high school to facing issues about her hair, Union doesn't hold back with vignettes of navigating being black. She includes instances of being called ""pretty for a black girl,"" of on-set hairstylists frying her strands because they didn't understand styling black hair, and a condescending experience with a Friends director well into her film career.  She also recounts dropping ""Black Bombs"" of truth on her stepsons Xavier, Zion and Zaire Wade, telling them how to behave at sleepovers with friends or when hanging out with girls so their actions aren't misconstrued.  5. Her relationship with Dwyane Wade isn't always perfect  Even though Union and Wade look picture perfect together, their relationship has its ups and downs. Union discussed her battle with IVF treatments, revealing she had ""eight or nine miscarriages.""  ""For three years, my body has been a prisoner of trying to get pregnant,"" she writes of the struggle to conceive with Wade.  Their prenup was also a little messy, according to Union, but it's not as simple as who gets the couch when ther"	1

"Serena Williams is a three-time winner of the French Open women's singles title  French Open 2018 Venue: Roland Garros, Paris Dates: 27 May-10 June Coverage: Daily live radio and text commentaries on BBC Radio 5 live, the BBC Sport website and app.  Serena Williams pulled out of the French Open before her fourth-round match with Maria Sharapova because of an injury that affected her serve.  The 23-time Grand Slam winner recently returned to tennis after giving birth to her first child, but looked in good form in her opening matches.  ""I've had issues with the right pectoral muscle to the point where I can't serve,"" said the 36-year-old.  ""I'll have a scan. I won't know about Wimbledon until I get the results.""  Williams said she first felt the problem during her third-round win over German 11th seed Julia Gorges on Saturday.  She played in a doubles match with sister Venus on Sunday, saying she wanted to try to manage the problem before her match with Sharapova.  ""I tried lots of taping and support to see how it felt in match circumstances,"" Williams said.  ""It is hard to play when I can't physically serve. I've never had this injury before, I've never felt it in my life and it was so painful.  ""I don't know how to manage it.""  Williams said she will have an MRI scan in Paris on Tuesday and will stay in the French capital at least until the extent of her injury is clear.  Sharapova said she was ""looking forward"" to playing Williams and ""disappointed"" the American had to withdraw.  ""I wish her a speedy recovery and hope she returns to the tour soon,"" she added.  The 31-year-old Russian, a two-time winner at Roland Garros, will play 2016 champion Garbine Muguruza. The Spaniard was 2-0 up in the opening set of her match against Lesia Tsurenko when the Ukrainian retired hurt.  Rivalry was set to be renewed  The possibility of Williams facing Sharapova had been grabbing attention since the draw was made at Roland Garros 10 days ago.  And the meeting of the two former champions, both making comebacks at Roland Garros this year, was set up when Williams beat Gorges shortly after Sharapova beat Czech sixth seed Karolina Pliskova.  Williams has recently returned after giving birth to daughter Olympia in September, while 28th seed Sharapova is back in the draw after being refused a wildcard last year as she returned from a 15-month drugs ban.  The pair have had a frosty relationship since they first met on court in 2003, although Williams said in her pre-match news conference on Saturday that she did not have any ""negative feelings"" towards the Russian.  There has not been much of a rivalry on court in recent years, Williams having won 19 of their 21 meetings. Both of Sharapova's wins came in 2004 - including that year's Wimbledon final.  Six matches in six days takes its toll - analysis  Tennis correspondent Russell Fuller at Roland Garros  Williams had been in astoundingly good form in the first week, but footage of the final set of Sunday's doubles - which she and sister Venus lost 6-0 - showed Serena rolling in a number of slow first serves.  The three-time champion chose to play doubles as well as singles because she knew she needed matches under her belt. But six matches in six days - after just four in the previous 16 months - appears to have taken its toll. A pectoral injury is most commonly associated with overuse.  Tuesday's MRI scan will reveal more, but if there is no serious damage, then Wimbledon may still be very much within Williams' sights. There are still four weeks to go, and not being able to play a grass-court warm-up event beforehand should not be a concern: only twice in her career has she done so."	1

Speaking to the Press Association during the London premiere for the heist film, Viola admitted that the industry has been slow to depict women accurately on screen.  She revealed: 'I think we are in a zeitgeist where people want to make more films about women because it's the hip thing to do. I don't want it to be a hip thing, I want it to actually be a change. I don't want it to be a hashtag.  'I feel very much attached to the idea that whatever woman I'm presenting, it should be a woman that is reflective of the women that I know in my life', Viola added.

Wait a minute. Kylie Jenner just said that she lives with her bestie, Jordyn Woods, instead of with her baby daddy, Travis Scott. Does this mean there’s trouble in paradise?  Gasp! Are Travis Scott, 27, and Kylie Jenner, 20, on the rocks? Probably not, but what the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star said while filming a makeup tutorial for Vogue raised some eyebrows – pun intended. “I test out most of my stuff on Jordyn [Woods, 20] because we live together,” Kylie said, revealing that she shares a home with her BFF instead of her BF and baby daddy. “ So I’m like, ‘Jordyn, I need you.’ Everyone that comes in my house has tinted red arms from swatches and shadows.”  Actually, Kylie didn’t make it clear whether or not Travis lives with Kylie and Jordyn. Considering that Kylie owns a 13,000-square-feet home with eight bedrooms, 11 bathrooms (one she reportedly paid $12 million for in 2016, according to House Beautiful), it’s not beyond reason to think her boyfriend has a space of his own. To be sure, fans better keep an eye on Travis’s arms. If he’s walking around with “tinted red” stripes, then it’s clear his “roommate” got a hold of him for some makeup experiments.  Kylie and Travis seem to be going strong, as they’re one of Hollywood’s “Most In Love Couples” at the moment. It’s easy to see why. While Kylie has decided to keep baby Stormi out of the spotlight, it is hard for her to keep her love for Travis a secret. She was spotted boarding a private jet with her daughter, flying off to a romantic getaway with Travis. A month before that, the two found a babysitter so they could take in a NBA Playoffs game. They two didn’t need a kiss cam – they were spotted smooching in the front row!  Will it be long before Kylie and Travis take the next step? After seeing Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson get engaged after just a few weeks of dating, Kylie is ready for Travis to get down on one knee. “Kylie is a bit jealous of Ariana,” a source EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com. “She is now pressuring Travis to pop the question ASAP and she wants a massive ring too.” Well, if Travis proposes, does that mean he’ll finally move in with Kylie (if he hasn’t already?)	0

We’re told that the controversial former star — who left in 2012 after doing battle with former pal Bethenny Frankel — has filmed multiple appearances for the upcoming season, including scenes last month at the Angel Ball and on Thursday night at a charity event in Midtown.  But insiders say that it isn’t — as of yet — a full-time comeback. Zarin starred on the first four seasons of the Bravo show. She popped up again earlier this year when the cast attended the funeral of her husband, Bobby Zarin.  Bravo didn’t comment and Zarin didn’t get back to us.	1

"An intimate crowd of approximately 40 people got an incredible surprise Saturday night when Taylor Swift performed at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe. Swift joined country songwriter Craig Wiseman on stage for a acoustic performance, reports The Tennessean.  The Bluebird is a Nashville landmark known for hosting some of country music's best songwriters and musicians, and the occasional megastar. On Saturday, Wiseman casually invited Swift to join him on stage at the venue where she used to play before her rise to fame.  Swift took the stage and talked to the audience about her early days, when she moved to Nashville at just 14 to learn more about songwriting. The singer played ""Shake It Off"" as an example of how catchy three chords can be. Swift also played ""Better Man,"" a Grammy-nominated song she wrote for Little Big Town. She said she appreciated hearing a song she wrote played by someone else.  ""When I would play writers nights ... I didn't have the experience of a writer writing something and then it going out into the world and you earing it from someone else's perspective until recently,"" Swift said, reports The Tennessean. ""Little Big Town gave me the opportunity to feel that way ... to be at the Bluebird and play a song you've maybe heard on the radio. I will always be forever grateful to them for that.""  Swift closed off her surprise performance with a song she said Wiseman did not ""get"" when she first wrote it at 17. The pop star said that after Wiseman told her he didn't get it, the two worked on another song instead, but when Swift when home, she finished writing the original song.  ""This is the song I almost wrote with Craig Wiseman,"" Swift told the crowd. ""It's called 'Love Story.'""  ""Love Story"" became an eight-time platinum hit.  The Tennessean reports that Swift's performance was filmed for a documentary on the 35th anniversary of the Bluebird Cafe. Swift got her first break there, when Big Machine Label Group's Scott Borchetta saw her play the room when she was an 8th grader. He offered her a record deal."	1
Yikes! These stars just didn’t bring their A-game to the CMA Awards red carpet! Kellie Pickler took a feathery risk and it didn’t pay off; and there’s more where that came from! See the fashion flubs from country’s biggest night!  Someone call the fashion police, because we have some red carpet culprits! While some stars showed up and showed out at the 2017 Country Music Association Awards in Nashville, there were others who missed the mark. Sadly, the always-stunning Kellie Pickler just didn’t do it for us tonight. She hit the red carpet in a long sleeve mini dress that was covered in feathers. She certainly took a risk, but it didn’t exactly pay off. Another star who was close to missing the worst dressed list was Brittany Snow. Her makeup and auburn hair looked flawless, and so did the the deep blue color of her dress. However, Brittany’s gown just looked awkward because of its oddly placed waistline, which is one of her best features! See our worst dressed picks in our attached gallery!  Then, a dynamic duo hit the carpet — Amanda Shires and Kelly Bueno. However, it was too bad they weren’t a lethal combination in the fashion department. The two stars rocked pink tanks that read, “Mama wants to change that Nashville sound,” and knee-length, black pencil skirts with fishnet stalkings. While we love when stars make powerful statements, between the tanks, pencil skirts and fishnets, we weren’t sure what was happening. So, we’re going to have to call this one a major fail.  Moving on to the next fashion faux pas, we have to add Ashley Campbell and Carly Pearce to the list. Ashley hit the CMA Awards red carpet in a layered, white gown with a plunging neckline, that gave us major summer vibes. And, her open-toe black stilettos just didn’t mesh well with her color scheme. Pearce, on the other hand, opted for darker colors of black and blue on the red carpet. However, he see-though dress with a plunging neckline and visible undergarments was just way too much for the formal event. Maybe next time, ladies!  Although these stunning stars didn’t perform in the fashion category, they have some epic performances to look forward to during tonight’s show! Garth Brooks, Faith Hill, Reba McEntire, Lady Antebellum, Luke Bryan, Pink, and many more country crooners will all take the stage. And, be sure to keep tabs on who takes home the coveted CMA Awards, with our full winner’s list — right here!  HollywoodLifers, who was your pick for worst dressed?	1

"Kim Kardashian and Kanye West were seen in a family portrait shared on social media on Tuesday.  The power couple were sitting with all three of their kids, North, five, Saint and Chicago, 11 months, during Saint's Tarzan themed birthday party.  This is the first portrait they have shared since their Easter family photo in April.  Family photo: Kim Kardashian posed with her husband Kanye West and her children North, five, Saint, three, and Chicago, 11 months for Saint's third birthday bash  The last one: This is the first portrait they have shared since their Easter family photo in April  Kim gave birth to North the year before she and Kanye held a sumptuous wedding in Florence, making him her third husband.  She then brought Saint into the world the year after her wedding, and little Chicago was born via surrogacy in January of this year.  Kim's own mother is the legendary family 'momager' Kris Jenner, and her father is the late O.J. Simpson lawyer Robert Kardashian.  Kris, who spells her name the same way as Kim's second ex-husband, had four children with Robert - Kourtney, Kim, Khloe and Rob Kardashian.

So I don’t know what really has completely changed my world, besides her, of course.'  Said Kylie: 'But I feel like it’s only gotten better. You’re less selfish - and I actually enjoy changing diapers. It’s really satisfying. To make her clean again. And I don’t know, the whole thing is really…it’s like such an amazing experience.'

On the eve of Venom‘s digital release (Blu-ray and DVD on December 18th), Sony Pictures has unleashed a never-before-seen deleted scene of Eddie Brock unleashing his inner demon.  Coming to us by way of Twitter (h/t CBM), this is by no means the full deleted scene, and has instead been edited so that fans are left wanting that little bit more. Nevertheless, it offers a pretty good look at the sinister symbiote being triggered by a car alarm – much to the amazement of a young kid, who can do nothing but gawk at Venom as the inky-black monster makes short work of the doomed automobile.  Feast thy eyes:  This particular snippet is one of three deleted/extended scenes set to be included on the Venom Blu-ray – the other two concern Eddie and Venom’s ride to the hospital, while the third is said to offer up an extended version of the post-credits scene at San Quentin. Could that mean that we’ll get a better look at Woody Harrelson’s Carnage? Who knows?  What we do know, however, is that a Venom sequel is nigh on certain, after Sony’s budding franchise-starter blew past all expectations on its journey to $850M worldwide. To put that eye-watering cume into perspective, that’s higher than Wonder Woman and both Deadpool movies, proving that, while critics came down hard on the standalone adventure, there was still a big, big appetite for the sinister symbiote.  Exactly where things go from here is another question entirely, but we understand Sony’s Marvel Universe is working towards new spinoff projects for Kraven, Silk, Silver and Black, and Morbius, the latter of which will star Jared Leto as the undead anti-hero. Color us intrigued.	1
"Playboy's frisky, playful bow-tied bunny logo is a cultural icon that is instantly recognizable. It evokes images of the decadent, pleasure-seeking lifestyle shown in Hugh Hefner's Playboy magazine. The success of the magazine led Hefner to open a chain of nightclubs, the Playboy Clubs. Early members received a distinctive key with the bunny logo on its grip (in 1966 they switched to a plastic key card). Possession of a Playboy Club key became a status symbol. And one of the chief attractions at the Playboy Clubs was the Bunnies. Bunnies greeted keyholders and their guests at the door. They served food and drinks, checked coats & hats, sold cigarettes and other Playboy merchandise. Whatever their position, they created a fun and welcoming atmosphere.  Playboy Bunnies were in the vanguard of the sexual revolution. It goes without saying that they were beautiful, but a Bunny also had to be a cheerful ""people person."" Bunnies worked hard, but if they were successful they could earn above-average pay and generous tips . A select few Bunnies went on to become Playboy models or even Playmates (centerfold models). Many went on to careers in diverse fields: modeling, acting, business, law, medicine, government. The same outgoing and hard-working traits that made them good Bunnies led to success at other jobs. Most also became wives and mothers. (Did you know that Jon Bon Jovi's mother was once a Playboy Bunny?)  If you want to recapture that aura, get one of our bunny costumes. They're patterned after the original design worn by the actual Bunnies in the Playboy Clubs. The classic ""Bunny Suit"" was a strapless satin corset in any color. It included Bunny ears of the same fabric, black pantyhose and dyed-to-match satin pumps. All Bunnies wore a white collar with a black bow tie, white cuffs with Playboy cufflinks, and a large, fluffy white bunny tail. Complete your Bunny look with glamorous makeup and a great hairstyle.  Then polish your Bunny skills. Practice the Bunny Stance: with your feet together, arch your back and tuck your hips under. Three-inch or higher heels will help. The Bunny Perch is easier--just lean against the top of a chair back. Your man will love it even more if you serve him a drink by doing the Bunny Dip! The Bunny Dip was a move invented by an early Bunny to prevent wardrobe malfunctions while serving drinks. To do it, position yourself beside and a bit ahead of the seated guest, facing the same way. Starting from the Bunny Stance, bend your knees and lean backwards, keeping your body straight. This gives your guest a good view of your assets as you place his drink in front of him. It may take a bit of practice to master this move while keeping your balance and avoiding spills. Above all, be charming and flirtatious!"	1

"With Thor: Ragnarok now out on Digital HD, many people are experiencing the film from the comfort of their own homes. Including star Chris Hemsworth, who is using the opportunity to indoctrinate his children!  The actor posted a video to social media featuring his kids watching the film on an iPad, proud that he's ""brainwashing"" them into becoming Marvel- no, THOR fans. Check it out in the video below.  To be fair, this is a marked improvement from the last update about Hemsworth's kids and their fondness for superheroes. He previously told E! that they preferred a different god from the DC Comics' pantheon.  ""They want to be Wonder Woman, both my sons and my daughter,"" Hemsworth said. ""Yep, that's alright, I love Wonder Woman, it's cool. Different universe, but that's ok.""  The kids also seem much more engrossed now that they're watching the finished product, because they were ""wildly unimpressed"" when they visited him on the set of the new film.  ""They were like, 'This is so boring! We thought you fought monsters for a living and you don't. You just pretend, and so we're going to wreck stuff,'"" he said. ""And that's what they did. They ran around and broke things… If they see the movie and they see all the special effects, which make me look cool, then I'm the hero. But once they saw behind the curtain, it ruined it.""  It looks like they just needed some time to process, because they're just as engrossed in the battle between the God of Thunder and Surtur as many viewers were when the film premiered in theaters.  Who knows if Hemsworth will drag his kids to another Marvel Studios set in the future. With Avengers: Infinity War set to release in a couple of months and his filming completed on the untitled sequel, he's candid in admitting to Channel 7's Sunrise that he's ""done"" with the role unless something compelling comes along.  ""We felt like we reinvented the last one in a big way,"" he said of Taika Waititi's Ragnarok. ""We might have a conversation if there's another great script that comes along. But at the moment that's it.""  Thor: Ragnarok is now available on Digital HD, and will premiere on Blu-ray and DVD on March 6th."	1
"The Kardashians want to protect themselves. In response to being stalked, Kendall Jenner is looking to buy a gun to defend herself. In a new clip from Keeping Up With the Kardashians, the model and sister Khloe Kardashian try to explain to Kim Kardashian why they want to carry guns.  ""Kendall and I were talking earlier and she just feels really unsafe. She says she has literally a different stalker outside of her house every few days. She's a single girl who lives alone, like someone's already broken into her home, what if she was there?"" Khloe says.  Kim, who is the mother to two (and soon three) small children, isn't an advocate of guns in the home. ""Well, that's what you have security for,"" she says in the preview. ""I'm not comfortable with it. I wouldn't want my kids around it. I wouldn't want sleepovers going on here, with the kids here and I know there's a gun.""  Despite her own experience being violently robbed in Paris, Kim insists that she wouldn't want to carry a gun. When asked if being armed that night would have saved her, Kim insists that she was outnumbered. ""I would not shoot these, it was three against one, or six, you know, or seven, I didn't know about. There was no way I was gonna get out of there, I'm not like, Laura Croft.""  Last year, Kendall was stalked by a man and she testified against him in court. ""This is not how I want to be living...I really don't feel safe in my own house...I'm already the kind of person who's on edge,"" she said while on the stand. Her stalker was arrested in August after she found him waiting in her driveway in the Hollywood Hills.  [Photo: Getty Images]"	1

Aaron Carter has reportedly left rehab after two months of treatment.  The I Want Candy hitmaker checked into a treatment facility in September to 'improve his health and work on his overall wellness,' and E! News reports he has left the centre after completing a two month program.  Aaron, 29, appears to already be back making music as he took to Instagram on Thursday to share a snap of himself looking at his computer from inside the recording studio.  Scroll down for video  Checked out: Aaron Carter has reportedly left rehab after two months, and appears to already be back making music as he shared a snap of himself in the studio on Thursday  He captioned the black and white image: 'focused', as fans wished him well in the comments section and begged him to release more singles.  Earlier this month, the star shared a shirtless before and after picture as he revealed he was happier, healthier and determined to get back into the studio.  He captioned the image: 'This is my before and after pics. I went from 115 to 160 pounds in two months I feel amazing. 2018 I’m ready for you!! My new Music is on its way!'  Aaron also looked happy and healthy last week when he volunteered to serve food to the less fortunate in a Los Angeles food bank on Thanksgiving.  Healing: Earlier this month, the star shared a shirtless before and after picture as he revealed he was happier, healthier and determined to get back into the studio  It has been a tumultuous year for Aaron, who was arrested in July on suspicion of driving under the influence and marijuana charges, and came out as bisexual a month later.  The younger brother of Backstreet Boy Nick Carter checked into rehab on September 22, with his representatives announcing the star was working on 'coming back stronger than ever before'.  A statement at the time read: 'Aaron has decided to enter a facility to improve his health and work on his overall wellness.  'He is going to do this privately and focus all his attention on being the best person and performer possible. He is grateful for the support and love from his fans and looks forward to coming back stronger than ever before.'  The entertainer then told his fans on Twitter: 'Only I can change my life ... no one can do it for me.'  Giving back: Aaron also looked happy and healthy last week when he volunteered to serve food to the less fortunate in a Los Angeles food bank on Thanksgiving  Aaron temporarily left the facility in early October to address 'several legal and personal matters,' which he did not discuss further.  However, the singer returned to complete his treatment program later that same month.  Speaking about his re-admission into the rehab centre, his publicist revealed that after taking care of his personal life, he was keen to complete his treatment.  He said in a statement: 'Aaron has taken care of the legal and financial matters that required his attention and returned to the wellness facility to complete his program.'  Ups and downs: It has been a tumultuous year for Aaron, who was arrested in July on suspicion of driving under the influence and marijuana charges, and came out as bisexual a month later  Making a change: The younger brother of Backstreet Boy Nick Carter checked into rehab on September 22, with his representatives announcing the star was working on 'coming back stronger than ever before'  Aaron's decision to enter rehab came after he previously admitted he was 'concerned' about his 'overall health.'  He explained: 'I'm concerned about my overall health because people tell me I look like I have AIDs or I look like I have cancer or I look like I'm dying.'  In April of this year, the former teen heartthrob revealed why he had lost so much weight recently when he told fans he had suffered from a hiatal hernia which affects his appetite.  'By the way y'all wanna know why I'm so skinny?' he asked his 600,000 followers at the time. 'It's because @ 19 I was diagnosed with a hiatal hernia, I didn't choose that. Be 	1
DJ Khaled can’t seem to figure out how to say Jenna Dewan Tatum‘s name, so he made someone else say it at the 2018 iHeartRadio Music Awards held at The Forum on Sunday (March 11) in Los Angeles.  The DJ co-hosted the show and had to introduce Jenna and Eve to the stage.  “Our next presenters are lions. LIONS! Where my girl at? Hold on, where my girl at?” Khaled said before grabbing a crew member. He added, “I can’t say this name right.”  The crew member then said, “Here is Jenna Dewan Tatum” and Khaled cut him off and said, “Thank you, thank you, thank you. And make some noise for Eve!”  Also pictured inside: Jenna‘s stylist Brad Goreski hitting the red carpet.  FYI: Jenna is wearing a Zuhair Murad Couture dress, Stella Luna shoes, and Jennifer Fisher jewelry.	1

So it seems that Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx have finally decided to go public with their romance which the two have managed to keep under wraps for years now. The ongoing denials by each star certainly had the masses scratching their heads seeing as the duo were often seen in one another’s company on getaways and at various locales in Los Angeles.  Reasons for Katie and Jamie not going public earlier are rumored to be due to a contract that was signed by Holmes during her swift divorce proceedings with her ex-husband Tom Cruise. The contract was said to have included a five-year dating clause which meant that the Dawson’s Creek star was not allowed to date publicly for this duration. Well, that was back in 2012, so the five years are up, which leads onlookers to believe that the contract was a real binding agreement.  Additional claims, since Jamie and Katie were spotted walking in Malibu holding hands, have been made regarding Cruise’s reaction to his ex and former co-star coming clean about their relationship. The action star is reportedly “furious” and “envious” about the relationship between Holmes and Foxx and feels a sense of betrayal over it all, as International Business Times states.  A said source indicates that Tom is bothered by the romance and that “Katie is so happy with someone else,” adding that “Tom would love to find his own true love, someone he can share the rest of his life with too. “  ‘Katie Holmes finally goes public with new man Jamie Foxx, I’m questioning why she ever agreed to marry Tom Cruise’https://t.co/NWx1Ogo3ml — The Sun (@TheSun) September 10, 2017  Loading...  It’s been no secret that Cruise’s relationship with the Church of Scientology has caused both of his marriages to fail and if the star is to find love again, it must be with the approval of the faith. As for Tom being “furious,” this seems a bit far-fetched seeing as the actor was snapped looking as happy as can be, even after news broke that Katie and Jamie are, in fact, an item.  Tom Cruise is pictured for the first time since ex-wife Katie Holmes confirmed her relationship with Jamie Foxx https://t.co/BqKD4cDrxm — Daily Mail Celebrity (@DailyMailCeleb) September 6, 2017  As The Sun indicated, Cruise recently landed in London and fans awaiting the Hollywood heartthrob were greeted with an ear-to-ear smile from Tom, who also gave an enthusiastic thumbs up. The actor had recently been injured while filming the latest installment for the Mission Impossible franchise, yet looked much better and entirely unaffected by the Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx reveal.

Sam Claflin, who bared his abs in movies like “The Hunger Games” and “Me Before You,” says he can identify with stories he’s read from actresses who say they have been body shamed on set.  “I read in an interview recently and I think it’s absolutely true: men have it just as bad,” the actor told The Sunday Morning Herald. “Well, not just as bad but they get it bad and it’s never talked about.  “I remember doing one job when they literally made me pull my shirt up and were grabbing my fat and going ‘you need to lose a bit of weight’. This other time they were slapping me. I felt like a piece of meat,” he said.  Also Read: Chloe Grace Moretz Is 'Appalled and Angry' Over Her Movie's Body-Shaming Poster  The actor, who will next appear in “My Cousin Rachel” opposite Rachel Weisz, said he continues to stay “insecure” about his body and sometimes won’t eat for weeks to get the body producers are looking for.  “I’m not saying it’s anywhere near as bad as what women go through but I, as an actor approaching each job, am insecure — especially when I have to take my top off in it — and so nervous,” he added. “I get really worked up to the point where I spend hours and hours in the gym and not eating for weeks to achieve what I think they’re going for.”  The 30-year-old said actors are held to different standards these days.  “In the ’50s and ’60s, it was never an issue,” he said. “James Bond never had a six pack. He had a hairy chest. Marlon Brando​ in ‘A Streetcar Named Desire’ had an incredible body but he was by no means ripped to within an inch of his life. There’s a filter on society that this is normal but actually it’s anything but normal.”  See Video: Emma Thompson Recalls Defending Hayley Atwell From Body-Shaming Movie Producer  This isn’t the first time Claflin has spoken out about his body. In December, the actor clarified that in a particular photograph, his face was photoshopped onto a male’s body.  Celebrities that have spoken out about body shaming include Chrissy Metz, Amy Schumer, Daisy Ridley, Lady Gaga, Demi Lovato and Emma Stone. Even Vin Diesel fell victim to the shaming: After photos surfaced of Diesel with a “softer” physique than fans are used to, the actor said, “I do think it’s wrong to body shame. Trolls on the Internet — there are all kinds of atrocities they commit on the Internet.”	1
Are Vanderpump Rules couple Brittany Cartwright and Jax Taylor getting their own wedding spin-off on Bravo?  During a new joint interview, the engaged couple let it slip that they are, at the very least, in talks to have their wedding televised on their own series.  When asked about their plans for a bachelor and bachelorette party, Jax let it slip that only one of his bachelor parties (he’s having two) will be on-camera. Brittany then corrected him, stating that it’s not certain yet that their wedding festivities will be televised.  “There’s going to be two bachelor parties,” said Jax to E! News Daily Pop. “There’s going to be one for all the guys, we’re going to go on a ski trip in Aspen, I think next month. That one’s going to be off-camera. And then the on-camera one is going to be in Miami.”  “Well, we’re hoping on-camera. We don’t know. We haven’t been picked up yet,” added Brittany.  While the couple has yet to announce their official wedding date, having their bachelor/bachelorette parties in January would point to a winter or spring wedding. And since Vanderpump Rules usually films during the summer months (filming on the latest season started in July), it’s hard to imagine they won’t be getting their own spin-off to document their big day.  Additionally, as most fans of Pump Rules are aware, a wedding spin-off would not make the first for Brittany and Jax as they had another spin-off last year titled Jax And Brittany Take Kentucky.  While Brittany and Jax continue to move forward with plans for their wedding, Brittany, who got engaged to Jax this past June, is opening up about how she moved on from Jax’s fling with Faith Stowers and learned to trust him again.  “I see him every single day making efforts and he’s completely changed the way he treats me, the way he talks to me, the way he listens to me. Every single thing about our relationship is better,” Brittany revealed to Us Weekly. “I know how much he’s wanting the wedding and how much he’s wanting to marry me, how much effort he’s putting into the wedding, just as much as me. I don’t know, whenever you know somebody as well as I know Jax, you can just tell.”  According to Brittany, she’s “very big on forgiveness” but often struggles to forget about Jax’s past infidelity.  “It is hard, trust me, and there are still days, sometimes, when you can’t help but think of horrible things from the past,” Brittany explained. “But for the most part, we’ve moved mountains in this relationship. I feel like we’re almost starting over, but we’ve grown so much. He does things before I even ask him now. Even just helping around the house. I can just tell in our everyday lives that he’s changed.”  Vanderpump Rules season seven premieres on Monday, December 3 at 9 p.m. on Bravo TV.

    It’s official! WAGS Miami stars Ashley Nicole Roberts and Philip Wheeler are married. The newlyweds tied the knot during a romantic beachside wedding in Curacao on Sunday, May 14, Us Weekly can exclusively confirm.  The Atlanta Falcons linebacker, 32, and reality star exchanged vows at sunset before some 100 guests.  “I really wanted to pick a place that no one I knew had been before … so it would be an experience not just for me and Phil, but for everyone,” Roberts told Us of the location ahead of their big day. “The island is close to Aruba, but closer to Venezuela and South America and it’s only a two-hour flight from Miami. It was perfect.”  The bride wore two dresses for her big day: During the ceremony she opted for a Milady-designed mermaid gown, which featured bling everywhere, and for the reception, she changed into a Lena Bernisha-designed dress with a detachable train.  “I wanted to be able to dance the night away,” Roberts told Us.  Their beach-glam wedding also featured lots of candles and gold touches.  “Everything is very formal beach glamour, it’s a beach wedding, but still very glam,” Roberts told Us of her vision. “Lots of bling, candles everywhere and gold touches.”  The couple got engaged during a November 2016 episode of the hit E! show.  Season 2 of WAGS Miami premieres on E! on June 29.	1
"Dakota Louis Meyer (born June 26, 1988)[1] is a United States Marine. A veteran of the War in Afghanistan, he was awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Battle of Ganjgal on 8 September 2009, in Kunar Province, Afghanistan. Meyer is the second-youngest living Medal of Honor recipient, the third living recipient for either the Iraq War or the War in Afghanistan[2] and the first living U.S. Marine in 38 years to be so honored.[3]  Early life and education [ edit ]  Meyer was born and raised in Columbia, Kentucky, the son of Felicia ""Killy"" Gilliam and Michael Meyer.[4][5] In 2006, after graduation from Green County High School, he enlisted in the Marine Corps at a recruiting station in Louisville, Kentucky and completed basic training at Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island.[4]  Military service [ edit ]  Meyer in Afghanistan  Meyer deployed to Fallujah, Iraq in 2007 as a scout sniper with 3rd Battalion, 3rd Marines. He gained national attention for his actions in Afghanistan during his second deployment in Kunar Province with Embedded Training Team 2-8.[6][7]  On 8 September 2009, near the village of Ganjgal, Meyer learned that three Marines and a Navy Corpsman, who were members of Meyer's squad and his friends, were missing after being ambushed by a group of insurgents. Under enemy fire, Meyer entered an area known to be inhabited by insurgents and eventually found the four missing servicemen dead and stripped of their weapons, body armor and radios. There he saw a Taliban fighter trying to take the bodies. The fighter tackled Meyer, and after a brief scuffle, Meyer grabbed a baseball-sized rock and beat the fighter to death.[8] With the help of Afghan soldiers, he moved the bodies to a safer area where they could be extracted.[9] During his search, Meyer ""personally evacuated 12 friendly wounded and provided cover for another 24 Marines and soldiers to escape likely death at the hands of a numerically superior and determined foe.""  Four U.S. servicemen died in the ambush:  1st Lt. Michael Johnson, 25, of Virginia Beach, Virginia  Staff Sgt. Aaron Kenefick, 30, of Roswell, Georgia  Gunnery Sgt. Edwin Wayne Johnson Jr., 31, of Columbus, Georgia  Hospital Corpsman Third Class James R. Layton, 22, of Riverbank, California.  A fifth man, Army SFC Kenneth W. Westbrook, 41, of Shiprock, New Mexico, later died from his wounds.[10]  Meyer stands at attention after receiving the Medal of Honor from U.S. President Barack Obama during the Medal of Honor presentation ceremony in the East Room of the White House , Washington, D.C., 15 September 2011.  On 6 November 2010, the Commandant of the Marine Corps, General James Amos, told reporters during a visit to Camp Pendleton, California that a living U.S. Marine had been nominated for the Medal of Honor. Two days later, Marine Corps Times, an independent newspaper covering Marine Corps operations, reported that the unnamed person was Meyer, citing anonymous sources. CNN confirmed the story independently two days later.[11]  On 9 June 2011, the Marine Corps announced that two other Marines on Meyer's team in Ganjgal would receive the Navy Cross, the second-highest award for valor a Marine can receive. Capt. Ademola D. Fabayo and Staff Sgt. Juan J. Rodriguez-Chavez were recognized for their roles in retrieving the bodies of the fallen Marines and Corpsman. Before Meyer began searching for the missing servicemen on foot, Rodriguez-Chavez drove a gun truck into the kill zone with Fabayo manning the truck's machine gun.[12]  When President Barack Obama's staff called Meyer to set up a time for the president to inform him that his case for the Medal of Honor had been approved, they were told Meyer was working at his construction job and were asked to call again during his lunch break.[13]  Meyer was awarded the Medal of Honor in a ceremony on 15 September 2011.[14] When a White House staffer contacted Meyer to arrange the ceremony, Meyer asked if he could have a beer with the pr"	1
"Last month, Elle King mysteriously posted a message to Instagram saying she had ""skipped out on my wedding. I married Rock&Roll instead"" -- a post alluding that she had split from Andrew ""Fergie"" Ferguson, who at the time was believed to be her fiance.

Throughout September and October, more than 30 new shows will be clamoring for space on your DVR. What’s worth a look, and what would you be totally fine to overlook?  TVLine in recent months has endeavored to guide you with First Impressions, full-on reviews, sneak peeks and other forms of “Ready your remote!” content, but sometimes you simply want to hear about the good and the sad.  To that end, each TVLine editor binged on scads of shiny new screeners to suggest three freshman shows that are at the top of the class and one that is (perhaps!) fated to flunk. Making things “interesting” this particular year was a poor crop of pilots, which led to a smaller assortment of shows earning placement on our “Watch!” lists — and yet one noob practically swept the “Skip!” category.  You already voted on which new shows you are most looking forward to, led by The Gifted and Young Sheldon. See what we have to say, then share your game plan for the about-to-arrive fall TV season.	1
The Bachelor's Lauren Bushnell split with beau Devin Antin after a year of dating.  The 28-year-old reality star began dating Devin in July of 2017, two months after ending her relationship with fiance Ben Higgins, whom she met on season 20 of The Bachelor.  Lauren and Devin met on Tinder and struck up a friendship before she competed on the ABC reality dating game show.  Splits: The Bachelor's Lauren Bushnell split with beau Devin Antin after a year of dating; (pictured March)  'I don’t think I’ve shared before but I only met up with one person from the app and it was him,' the beauty wrote during an Instagram Q&A with fans in October 2017.  'We hung out for a while but more as friends but always got along really well.  'Fast forward two years later when I moved back to L.A. we hung out to catch up and things just kinda happened after that.' she explained.  The former flight attendant also said that her last relationship with Higgins made her more aware of walking down the aisle.  Beginnings: Lauren and Devin had met on Tinder and struck up a friendship before she competed on the ABC reality dating game show; (pictured August)  She told the fan: 'I’ve learned a lot of things in the last couple years and this is a big one. Marriage is such a special and sacred thing that should never be rushed.'  When asked if she planned on marrying Antin, the star gushed.  'I do see a future with him,' she said.  'But I want to be 1000 percent sure before I get engaged and even more sure before I get married. And for me that takes time.'  Time was not on Antin's side as the two have now gone separate ways.  'I’ve always been someone who maybe jumps into things a little too quickly and I fall really fast,' she told UsWeekly on August 6.  'And I always had this idea that I was going to be married by this age, kids, and this was going to be my plan … and now, I mean I’m almost 29 but I don’t really have a timestamp on anything anymore, which is nice.'	1
"Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will say their ""I dos"" in just one day, but before they take their trip down the aisle, TODAY took a moment to check in with a few of their special wedding guests.  Markle's ""Suits"" co-stars Sarah Rafferty, Gina Torres and Rick Hoffman have had the chance to really get to know the former actress over the course of seven seasons on their hit show, and on Friday, they opened up about the bride-to-be.  ""I hope nothing but the best for her,"" Torres told TODAY. ""This is an incredible step in her life, and to bear witness to that is extraordinary.""  But they've all had a while to get used to the idea. Long before Markle and her betrothed told the world about their romance, she told her ""Suits"" pals about it.  Trending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service  ""I got the news early, and I was like, 'You've got to be kidding me,'"" Hoffman said. ""It was like both of us in the trailer, just kind of like, 'Oh! You're dating a prince?!' You know, I was just like, 'Take it slow, be careful — don't let him hurt you.'""  That last bit was deadpan humor, but Torres said they were all serious when it came to keeping tight-lipped about the happy news.  ""We knew she was excited, and there was reason to keep it close to the vest,"" she added.  Of course, that's just the sort of thing anyone would do for a friend — especially one so close.

We were with each other for longer than we went to college or high school with our friends. We became family in a way — we're still family. So this is a wonderful family affair.""  Hoffman is grateful to have her in the family, too, since years before Markle's own wedding plans, she helped him out in a pinch at another wedding.  ""I'll give you an idea (of how great she is),"" he said. ""So I was in a relationship that didn't work out, and I had to go to a wedding in Paris. ... I was dateless, and Meghan was like, 'Do you want me to come with you?' I was like, 'Yeah, that would awesome.' We had the producer schedule our schedules off. Meghan and I had the best week.""  But their time together on ""Suits"" is now over. Markle and her on-screen other half, actor Patrick J. Adams, left the show at the end of last season.  ""'Suits' continues, and (their characters) Mike and Rachel are really still there — their spirits are still there,"" Rafferty said.  ""They were really the major artery of the show, and now we have to sort of regenerate another artery,"" Hoffman added.

"Evan Bass and Carly Waddell's wedding, filmed during a halt in production, airs on Tuesday. The pair talk to THR about ""the absurdity of going on TV to fall in love.""  Paradise is back and so is one of Bachelor Nation’s favorite couples — but it didn't always look that way.  Bachelor in Paradise alums Evan Bass and Carly Waddell are set tie the knot on ABC Tuesday when the fourth season returns for the second half of its two-night premiere. The two chose to say “I do” in Mexico, returning to the beaches where they first fell in love on last year's Paradise. Chris Harrison officiated their intimate ceremony at the Vidanta Nuevo Vallarta resort near Puerto Vallarta in June.  But the state of their televised wedding hit a snag when production on the series shut down. After a June 4 sexual encounter between two castmembers who had been drinking, Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson, a producer filed a misconduct allegation and studio Warner Bros. Television suspended filming on June 11 to investigate. Filming eventually resumed two weeks later, but Bass and Waddell's nuptials took place June 17, when the fate of the season was still up in the air.  Bass and Waddell now tell The Hollywood Reporter that the fate of their wedding, however, was never a question.  ""We were always going to get married,"" Bass tells THR of the ceremony happening amid the investigation. ""Obviously if production was shut down, then it wouldn’t have aired, but the most important thing for us was to get married in Paradise.”  Bass, 34, and Waddell, 31, met and got engaged during the summer of 2016 on the third season of Paradise. Bass, an erectile dysfunction specialist, was introduced to viewers on JoJo Fletcher's season of The Bachelorette. Waddell, a singer-songwriter on Chris Soules' season of The Bachelor, also appeared on the previous season of Paradise.  Now, the couple remains one of a handful of success stories to emerge from the franchise — and they now have their first child on the way.  When they returned to Mexico amid the summer saga, they both had to block out the production shutdown to keep their TV fairytale going. “We were sort of in that wedding glow,” Bass explains. “It felt like we were in a bubble. It was all about the wedding. I think everyone was super respectful of the fact that this was our big day. It was all about us.”  Waddell, who wore a dress by Israeli designer Idan Cohen, shared her favorite moment: Bass’ face when he first saw her walking down the aisle. “His jaw was on the floor.”  Bass added, “It felt so full-circle. A year earlier Carly was puking a few hundred feet away from where we were getting married on our first date.” The pair sealed the deal with a set of Neil Lane rings.  Other Bachelor franchise alums present at the ceremony helped to ensure that the behind-the-scenes drama didn't tarnish their big day. ""Nobody wanted to bother us with stuff that would take us away from our wedding,"" Bass says. Wells Adams, who is the bartender on the current season and appeared on their cycle of Paradise, was one of Bass’ groomsman and texted him during the shutdown to offer his support: “Wells was like, ‘I don’t care man. I’m there.’”  The morning of their wedding, Bass published a column on THR pleading with ABC to not cancel the show. With the investigation still ongoing, WBTV and ABC were unable to offer any details on if the show would return.  Looking back, Bass admitted that there was doubt in his mind that he pushed aside about whether filming on the show — and potentially the series — would ever resume. “I felt through sheer willpower that I could make it come back to life,"" he now says. ""I trust everyone that’s a part of the show. I felt like we knew it would come back.""  In the wake of the season four investigation, the amount of alcohol consumed on set became a hot topic. As a result of the controversy, Paradise kept tabs on the cast's drinking when they returned to set — something Harrison will discuss with the cast"	1
Mariah Carey, making a mess of things with diva behavior? As improbable as it seems, “The House” actor Cedric Yarbrough says that it really happened.  Yarbrough took to Facebook on Wednesday to detail how the singer “ruined” an intended cameo featuring her in the film.  “Yeah, a real funny cameo was SUPPOSED to happen in the new film #TheHouse with the superstar Mariah Carey. But it was ruined by superstar Mariah Carey,” Yarbrough wrote. “The film takes place in a suburban home but is made into a ‘Casino’. Why not have Mariah be an act in the casino? Funny idea.”  Also Read: Mariah Carey Blames 'Everybody' for New Year's Eve 'Chaotic Mess'  Yarbrough went on to say that Carey “eventually” graced the set with her presence, “after waiting for her for 3-4 hours!” And when the porpoise-ranged songstress arrived, Yarbrough recalled, she scuttled a stunt that had been cooked up in her absence.  “While we waited the director & team had the idea of doing a stunt that Mariah’s body double would do now & bring in Mariah to match it. They do the stunt. All goes well,” Yarbrough wrote. “When Mariah finally showed up she refused to match the stunt. ‘Darling, I would never do it that way…'”  Yarbrough added that Carey “requested a large fan for her hair to be blown around and a camera that would be above her, basically a crane shot.”  Also Read: Mariah Carey Sues 'Deceitful' Promoter Over Canceled Argentina, Chile Concerts  The actor went on to call Carey “borderline abusive.”  “This lady was unprofessional & borderline abusive to our director, who tried his best to appease her every wish. In the acting community, it’s not very good form to ‘tell’ on your fellow actors,” Yarbrough added. “They could be having a bad day, going through some personal things, & maybe Mariah was, I don’t know. But I do know that our crew didn’t deserve that, our director didn’t.”  As unsettling as Yarbrough’s account was, the actor wrote that he hadn’t even divulged the worst of it.  Also Read: Mariah Carey NYE Sabotage Claims Are 'Bullsh-t,' Jenny McCarthy Says (Audio)  “This kind of behavior just isn’t cool. I’m not even going to tell you the worst part. (i will if i see you in person & if i deem you ‘cool’),” Yarbrough wrote. “For you young actors, be on time, know your homework, but be courteous and respectful. For us old heads, the same. This kind of behavior should be called out for what it is. I miss ‘I had a vision of love’ Mariah. Be a damn professional.”	1

"Jennifer Garner has penned a heart touching message after visiting children affected by Hurricane Harvey in Huston, Texas, on Friday (8 September).  The Miracles from Heaven star has said that ""children look for light"" even though terrifying things have happened to them after the most powerful hurricane hit the Lone Star State in more than 50 years.  Garner has said that she has been ""inspired by the huge hearts in Texas"" with people from all walks of life coming together in this time of crisis.  Garner, who is on Save the Children's Board of Trustees, posted the moving message on Instagram after visiting the children the foundation is taking care of after Hurricane Harvey hit Texas. She also visited Hilliard Elementary to distribute donations to families with young children in need.  ""Today I was inspired by the huge hearts in Texas. There is a generosity of spirit that gets lost in political rhetoric, but-- people come together in a time of crisis. You know what's beautiful? Children look for light,"" Garner wrote alongside photos of her with her fans that she shared on the photo-sharing application.  She added, ""Terrifying things have happened to these kids in the past couple of weeks, but they don't want to dwell on those stories. They want to tell you that their neighbor's puppy was found. That they saved their mother's life by throwing her a rope when the flood water overcame her and now she's ok. That they all celebrated when power came back on. We have to protect our kids and we have to learn from them.""  ""Jennifer was there for a day visit with children and families benefiting from Save the Children's response,"" a representative for Save the Children told E! News.  ""Our emergency response team has been on the ground in Texas since before the storm hit, working to meet children and families' immediate needs.

The 33-year-old former reality star and fashion designer took to Instagram Story on Friday to share a video of herself singing along to the MTV show's theme song, ""Unwritten"" by Natasha Bedingfield, while her 11-month-old son, Sonny, listens.  In the clip, Port is driving in her car and belting out the lyrics, ""Feel the rain on your skin, no one else can feel it for you. Only you can let it in. No one else, no one else, can speak the words on your lips.""  She then takes a moment and tells her baby boy, ""Sonny, this is momma's song.""  The video comes eight years after the reality show, which ran for six seasons, aired its final episode on July 13, 2010. Port, however, left The Hills after season four to star in her own spin-off, The City, which aired from 2008 to 2010.  Since then, the Los Angeles native tied the knot with Tim Rosenman in November 2015, and they welcomed their son, Sonny, on July 27, 2017.  ET caught up with Port earlier this year, where she revealed that she's down for a Hills reboot -- minus the ""fake drama.""  ""I'm down to get back together with everybody,"" Port said, days after Kristin Cavallari shared on Spencer Pratt and Heidi Montag's podcast that she'd be open to a reunion. ""I feel like it would have to depend on what it was.""  Hear more of what she said in the video below.

October 2017  During an interview with Piers Morgan, Cattrall says she will not do another Sex and the City movie and that she was never really friends with her Sex and the City co-stars.  When asked by Morgan if there will ever be more Sex and the City, Cattral said, “Not for me. That was part of turning 60. That was a very clear moment of how many years do I have left and what do I want to do with it? What haven’t I done? I feel that the show was the best when it was the series and the bonus was the two movies.”	0
Gateway Episode: “Chapter 1: Not If, How”  More than a decade ago, Bill Simmons cross-pollinated sports and pop culture and launched The B.S. Report at ESPN, the predecessor of The Bill Simmons Podcast. Early on—The B.S. Report predates Marc Maron’s WTF by two years—Simmons grasped that an uninterrupted, long-form interview scarcely existed in the media wasteland. He took note of the diminishing returns of what celebrities and athletes were willing to say and the disgust fans had for sound bites and puff pieces. Now, he routinely books guests who won’t, or don’t always, open up elsewhere: Kevin Durant, an NBA champion and typically a man of few words, for instance, showed up this year for a series of fascinating, raw interviews. Simmons’s talk with The Atlantic’s Ta-Nehisi Coates is also a must-listen. The host steers the conversation toward sports to get them chatting, and then everything you want to hear from America’s writer-in-residence comes out in unexpected, new ways.  Gateway Episode: “Ta-Nehisi Coates on Storytelling, Challenging Obama, and the Kaepernick Situation”  The Every Little Thing host Flora Lichtman will make her obsessions your obsessions. The show follows her train of thought, taking listeners through unexpected twists and turns where they find out flamingos can drink boiling-hot water, robust mite communities live on our faces, and why no one ever sees a living armadillo (it has to do with a phenomenon known as eye shine). Lichtman has a fantastic sense of humor and a charming curiosity that seduces listeners into the topic du jour. The show is perfect politically neutral entertainment for conversations with the in-laws or for work parties. While no one—maybe not even Lichtman—can predict what the next subject will be, after a few episodes, listeners get a sense for the quirky world she’s created and how she moves through it. Every Little Thing embodies the old maxim that the best ideas are the ones we can’t forget.  Gateway Episode: “Rapture Chasers”  The experience of This Is Actually Happening is different from most of what you’ll hear elsewhere. Every other week, people who have experienced a massive disturbance in their life tell their stories uninterrupted, no questions, no music. A male model becomes the target of the Japanese mafia in one show, and in the next, a victim of incest talks about how advocacy changed her life. They are all of the most articulate ilk, people who have done the hard work of thoughtful introspection and, without asking anything of the listener, they share themselves and what they’ve learned. This creates an intimate connection with the speaker, perhaps the closest thing listeners have to trying on another person’s consciousness. Each show title starts with “What if … ” (with titles like “What if you were a white supremacist?”) to tell the listener exactly what to expect, but others are more rhetorical (“What if you went to the dark side?”). Others still are so specific (like “What if you spent 15 hours on the edge of sanity?”) that you’ll want to know how exactly that question was posed in the first place.	1

In a statement, the New Zealand-born designer said she does 'not think that her wedding dress was a copy of any of our designs', adding that she has the 'greatest respect for Clare Waight Keller'.  Emilia, 34, described the Duchess of Sussex as looking 'absolutely beautiful' on her wedding day and said she has the 'utmost admiration and respect for her'.  It comes after she the designer previously suggested to the Mail that Meghan's wedding gown was 'identical to one of our dresses'.  Designer Emilia Wickstead has backtracked on her claim that Meghan's £200,000 Givenchy gown looked 'identical' to one of her own designs  In the statement shared on Instagram, Emilia said: 'I am extremely saddened by commentary that has appeared in the press and on-line over the past few days.  'Her Royal Highness, the Duchess of Sussex looked absolutely beautiful on her wedding day and I have the utmost admiration and respect for her.  'I do not think that her wedding dress was a copy of any of our designs. I have the greatest respect for Clare Waight Keller and the House of Givenchy — a huge source of inspiration to me.'  She added: ' I wish Their Royal Highnesses, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex a wonderful, happy and love filled life together.'  The New Zealand-born designer described Prince Harry's bride as looking 'absolutely beautiful' on her wedding day  In a statement posted on Instagram (above), Emilia, 34, said she does 'not think that her wedding dress was a copy of any of our designs'  Emilia is one of the Duchess of Cambridge's favourite designers, and was worn by Meghan on Anzac Day in April.  But following the wedding, she remarked on the similarity between Meghan's stunning Givenchy gown and one of her own off-shoulder designs.  She told the Mail: 'Her dress is identical to one of our dresses. Apparently a lot of commentators were saying, “It’s an Emilia Wickstead dress.”’  Emilia added: 'If you choose a simple design the fit should be perfect. Her wedding dress was quite loose.’	1

"Meet Golden Missy, a rescued seal named after Missy Franklin  Olympics Dispatch: A Day in the London Life of Gold Medalist Swimmer Missy Franklin When I was fourteen years old, I was selected to participate in the “Duel in the Pool: USA vs. Europe” competition. The event was held in Manchester, and that was my very first time visiting the U.K. I remember I loved all the people, the accents, and the food. This trip, however, is my very first time in London. For starters, I absolutely love the Olympic Village—the rooms are great, and we are all allowed to take home our Olympic-themed comforters. There is also an amazing cafeteria that is like a Costco with the cuisine of every possible country represented. I stayed healthy, of course, and focused on more familiar food during the competition (mainly British and American fare) but after my last race on Saturday night, I hit the sushi bar and took a trip to McDonald’s for a McFlurry. Overall, London has put on a fantastic Olympic Games. Yes, the facilities are wonderful, but the people have really made the trip. Whether you’re in a shop, riding the tube, or at the Olympic Park, everyone is so friendly and helpful. Now that the competition has wrapped and I have a little downtime, I have a few other things on my agenda, including a double-decker bus tour and a ride of a river boat down the Thames. I also told my parents that Big Ben is a must! People often ask me what life is like for an Olympian—here is my diary detailing a typical day at the Games . . .      9:30 a.m. Wake up at my parents’ rented flat in London and grab breakfast from a little place across the street.    10:30 a.m. Get picked up for media interviews with my mom and dad.    11:30 a.m. Arrive at Olympic Park.    12:00 p.m. Join other Olympic gold medalist swimmers Dana Vollmer, Katie Ledecky, Nathan Adrian, Matt Grevers and Brendan Hansen for the Today show. It is so great to see them all again!    1:30 p.m. Head to mall for an interview with Olympic swimming legend Amy Van Dyken. Stop by the Village on the way there to check to see if my ticket request for gymnastics went through. Fingers crossed!    2:30 p.m. Finally time for lunch. I am starving!    4:00 p.m. Head to the BBC and Canadian Television studios for some more interviews.    5:30 p.m. One of the last interviews of the day, with Piers Morgan. It is so nice to meet him in person. They asked me to wear all my medals, but I don’t think anyone realizes just how heavy the medals actually are.    6:30 p.m. Head home with my mom and dad. We eat dinner with my cousin Darryl.    9:00 p.m. Watch a movie with my cousin and Skype with friends back home.    1:00 a.m. Bedtime! It’s been a long but fun day. I’m definitely looking forward to seeing the city with my family this week. Read the full article in Vogue.  Young Olympic swimmers have to decide future WASHINGTON - As I watched Melissa ""Missy"" Franklin touch the Olympic pool wall Friday in a brilliant display of teenage athleticism, I could only think of that old slogan: ""You've come a long way, baby!"" It was 40 years ago when another Melissa, full of teenage enthusiasm and competitive juices, knifed through the water at another Olympics to capture the same 200-meter backstroke event and gave the cause of U.S. women's swimming a huge boost. Melissa Belote was just 15, a Springfield, Va., high school sophomore, when she landed in Munich in 1972 for an Olympics that was to bring both triumph and tragedy. Mention those Olympics, and competing visions of terrorists and murdered Israeli athletes and swimmer Mark Spitz's unparalleled seven-gold performance will flash through the minds of people old enough to remember. What they most likely won't recall is the young lady with the big smile who cooled down the rest of the world's ""phenoms"" with two individual gold medals and a third in the relays, all record-setting performances in both the 100- and 200-meter backstroke, as well as the 400-meter individual-medley relay."	1
"Bachelorette Becca Kufrin hasn't been shy about her strong feelings for contestant Garrett Yrigoyen. The 29-year-old medical sales rep received Becca's first impression rose in Episode 1, and since then, he's been a fairly quiet but valid candidate in the race for Becca's heart. Garrett has been vocal about his short-lived first marriage throughout the season, and the possibility of him getting engaged again caused his family some anxiety at last week's hometown date. With his family's wise warnings in mind, Becca and Garrett's fantasy suite date was romantically intense...as in, the date literally ended in a tent.  While Blake Horstmann has agonized over the thought of the other men falling in love with Becca, Garrett has played the part of the happily oblivious guy who's just pleased to be there. Going into fantasy suite week, Becca admitted she had fallen in love with two men and was falling for a third, but anyone keeping up on the season could tell that Blake and Garrett had her heart split into two. Her only concern with Garrett was whether he would challenge her consistently throughout life, while Garrett was worried about becoming engaged again only for the relationship to fail.  Meanwhile, a date with Garrett usually means a pretty carefree day, but this week's date fell on a Thai national holiday. If your nightmare is floating down a lazy river with people splashing you from all angles, you probably wouldn't have enjoyed Becca and Garrett's bamboo rafting activity, but they seemed into it.  Anna Marie's BachelorTV on YouTube  When they put aside their paddles and sat down for a serious chat, Garrett revealed that Becca helped him reach a new level of communication with his family on his hometown date. The time seemed to alleviate Becca's worries about sending Jason home and only confirm that her connection with Garrett is worthwhile.  The date's nighttime portion also took an emotional turn when Garrett told Becca, ""I love you, and I hope you're the last woman I have to say that to."" Going into the fantasy suite date, the fear of being engaged was almost paralyzing, but the day's experience soothed his nerves and his tendency to overanalyze. Becca could relate to his fears because of her time with Bachelor Arie Luyendyk, who, as we all saw, bounced around real answers to questions and resorted to ""I love that""'s.  Of course, Becca was totally into Garrett's devotion. She willingly embraced his very Chris Soules-esque farming background on his hometown date, so it's safe to say that she could be in it for the long haul with Garrett.  Paralleling her own fantasy suite date with Arie, Becca and Garrett retreated to a tented treehouse for the night. Hopefully this doesn't foreshadow a future like Becca had with Arie, but fans on Twitter picked up on the startling similarity right away.  The freaky coincidence of date locations might not have sat well with fans, but Becca and Garrett were totally ready to commit to a life of glamping after that special night in the trees. Well, to each their own, I guess. Enjoy your tent, you crazy kids!  The Bachelorette returns on Monday, July 30, at 8 p.m. ET on ABC."	1

But in a bid to shape up the 28-year-old turned to twice-daily fitness classes.  Revealing all in an interview with Women’s Health, the High School Musical babe said she routinely attended SoulCycle.  She explained: “Put me on a bike in a room with loud music, and I’m happy. It’s like dancing without the stress of worrying if you look good.  “I’m really competitive when it comes to fitness. I like being around people so I can compete.”  Along with her dedicated fitness regime, Vanessa stuck to a high-fat, low-carb which helped to maintain her energy levels throughout the day.  The brunette beauty confessed that her strict diet meant she slimmed down quickly.  Vanessa said: “Since I got back to eating like this the last month or so, I’ve lost 10lbs. That’s a lot for my [5’1”] height.”  Now she’s maintaining her super toned physique with frequent yoga classes.  (Image: SPLASH)  She added: “I looked in the mirror and was like, ‘Who am I?’ It was definitely a journey back to myself, and yoga helped.  “I don’t consider it fitness. It’s more like therapy for me.”  Meanwhile Vanessa isn’t the only celeb to share a weight loss secret.  Ed Sheeran recently opened up about how he dropped 3.5st after gorging on pizza and beer.  To beat the bulge, the hitmaker asked his hockey player girlfriend Cherry Seaborn for fitness advice.  So the stunning blonde devised a diet plan and workout regime for him to follow.  Ed explained: “I did 10 minutes a day without fail – intervals of 30 seconds sprinting and 30 jogging.  “The key is to not miss a day, so you don’t have to do an hour.”	1

"Filling in for Jimmy Kimmel, McCarthy promised the audience she would address a subject ""the mainstream media doesn't want you to hear about.""  Melissa McCarthy is no stranger to playing zany characters — she was a scientist who believed in ghosts in Ghostbusters and Sean Spicer on Saturday Night Live, after all. But as the comedian was filling in as guest host for Jimmy Kimmel on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Thursday night, she might have played her strangest character yet: a conspiracy theorist who doesn’t believe in gravity.  Telling the audience that the mainstream media is hiding the truth behind the theory of ""gravitivity,"" McCarthy argues that the theory's originator, Sir Isaac Newton, also created the Fig Newtons cookie brand. Jennifer Aniston interrupts her lecture to remind her that people cannot fly, only to be forced into a harness by McCarthy and raised into the air so that the conspiracy theorist can prove her point.  McCarthy filled in on Thursday night for Kimmel after his son had heart surgery. Other guest hosts this week have included Chris Pratt, Tracee Ellis Ross and Neil Patrick Harris.  Check out the full segment below."	1
"Kourtney Kardashian reportedly split with her model boyfriend Younes Bendjima after nearly two years of dating, though Bendjima doesn't appear to be too heartbroken — as the paparazzi has captured him hanging out with friends on a beach in Mexico.  Kardashian, 39, apparently ended the relationship with Bendjima, 25, and the former couple have already unfollowed each other on social media, according to TMZ.  A source told People the breakup ""didn't end well.""  TMZ shared photos of Bendjima reportedly getting cozy with Jordan Ozuna, a former Hooters waitress, during his vacation. However, Bendjima denied anything was going on between the pair.  KKHLOE KARDASHIAN EXPLAINS HER 'PREGNANCY LIPS'  ""They really want me to be the bad guy,"" Bendjima wrote on an Instagram story Tuesday, including a screenshot of a Daily Mail article about his ""rebound"" girl.

""I'm not attached to this 'life' so you can't touch me,"" he continued. ""I know who I am where I'm from and where I'm going and that bothers you ... only one opinion matter the one of my Lord.""

Rule number one to achieving supple, expensive-looking skin? Never skip moisturizing. Well, it’s probably not rule number one, but moisturizing your skin is just as important as cleansing, whether you drink copious amounts of water, eat your fruits, and exercise—or not. What’s great finding the best skin-saving moisturizer is that everyone pretty much falls into one or more of the following skin-type categories—oily, dry, combination, or normal—and there are a wealth of moisturizing serums and creams that cater to each group. But today, we’re here to talk about oily skin.  Believe it or not, oily skin needs just as much hydration as normal, dry, and combination skin. “It's a misconception that people with oily skin do not need to use moisturizers. Stripping the skin of oil can interrupt the skin barrier and cause unwanted irritation. So it’s important to find a moisturizer that does not add additional oil to the skin, but is hydrating,” Dr. Lian Mack, MD, board-certified dermatologist, told ELLE.com. “Consumers should be looking for products that are both oil-free and non-comedogenic (meaning it does not clog pores or cause acne), and that hydrates the skin with water-loving ingredients like hyaluronic acid.”  Good thing lightweight, oil-free moisturizers are just a click away. Ahead, shop the best drugstore, luxury, and derm-approved face creams to keep your skin hydrated, not greasy.	1
"Project Runway is an American reality television series that focuses on fashion design. The contestants compete with each other to create the best clothes and are restricted by time, materials and theme. Their designs are judged by a panel, and one or more designers are typically eliminated from the show each week. During each season, contestants are progressively eliminated until only a few contestants remain. These finalists prepare a complete fashion collection for New York Fashion Week, which determines the winner.  Project Runway was created by Eli Holzman and was hosted by supermodel Heidi Klum. It has a varied airing history, with Bravo originating the first five seasons, followed by Lifetime for eleven more, before it was announced on May 14, 2018 that the series is tentatively returning to Bravo for the seventeenth season in the wake of The Weinstein Company's bankruptcy, pending TWC asset winner Lantern Entertainment's acquisition of the former TWC assets.[2] The show won a Peabody Award in 2008 ""for using the 'television reality contest' genre to engage, inform, enlighten and entertain.""[3] On September 7, 2018, it was confirmed that Heidi Klum and the show's mentor Tim Gunn would not be returning for a 17th season on Bravo as they both signed a deal to helm another fashion competition show on Amazon Video.[4]  Format [ edit ]  Project Runway uses progressive elimination to reduce the initial field of 12 or more fashion designers down to three or four before the final challenge. Each non-finale challenge (the scope of one episode) requires the designers to develop one or more pieces of new clothing to be presented at a runway show. The challenges range in creative diversity to test the designers' ingenuity while maintaining their personal fashion design aesthetic. These challenges may include creating a garment from non-traditional materials, such as: apartment furnishings (Season 3), recyclable materials (Season 3), items from a grocery store (Seasons 1 & 5), edible food items (Seasons 1, 4 & 10), plants and flowers (Season 2), using their own clothes that they happened to be wearing (Seasons 2 & 9), designing clothing with materials from a party store (season 8) ; or designing for a certain high-profile person (such as actress Brooke Shields, figure skater Sasha Cohen or Miss USA Tara Conner); or designing for a corporate fashion line (e.g., Banana Republic; Diane von Fürstenberg; Macy's; or Sarah Jessica Parker's Bitten); or centered on a specialized theme (such as ""cocktail party"", ""wedding gown"", ""female wrestling outfit"", or ""prom dress"").  The first several seasons were filmed in New York City, at The New School University's Parsons The New School for Design. They shop for materials at a fabric store in New York's Garment District (usually at MOOD Designer Fabrics) – unless the challenge requires otherwise (e.g., denim jackets and jeans from Levi's, confectionery and souvenirs at the Hershey's Store in Times Square, or fabric at Spandex House in Season 4). The designers live together, grouped by gender, at Atlas New York (an apartment building near Parsons) during Seasons 1–3 (back again at Season 5) and at New Gotham during Season 4. Along with the network change to Lifetime, the location changed from New York to Los Angeles for Season 6 only (permanently returning to New York for Season 7.) While on the show, the designers are prohibited from leaving the apartments without authorization, making unauthorized communication with family or friends, or using the Internet to research designs. Designers are also forbidden to bring pattern books or similar how-to materials with them during the show, or risk being disqualified from the competition (as was the case of Keith Michael in Season 3 and of Claire Buitendorp in Season 16).  The designers are given a budgeted stipend to select and purchase fabric and notions, and then provided a limited amount of time to finish their designs (the shortest being 5 hours and t"	1
Childish Gambino, aka Donald Glover, met a special Girl Scout who used his song, “Redbone,” to sell cookies in a viral video on “The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” Wednesday night.  >> Read more trending news  Charity Joy went viral last week when the Duluth, Georgia, girl and her father, Seymore Harrison Jr. creatively remixed Glover’s song to sell Girl Scout cookies.  Late-night host Stephen Colbert was so impressed with the video -- which has more than 4.5 million views -- that he invited Charity Joy, 6, and her father onto the show, where they got to meet Glover.  Girls Scout Cookie Sales Get a Bump Thanks to Singing Six-Year-Old  “I never was like, ‘I’ll make this, and then one day a little girl will sell Girl Scout cookies to it,’ Glover said. “It’s pretty great. A lot of people sent (the video) to me. I was really touched.”Before they got to meet, Colbert asked Glover for his thoughts on the video.  Related: Georgia dad, daughter sing their way to more Girl Scout cookie sales  Charity Joy had to sell 113 more boxes of cookies to meet her goal, and Glover bought them all.  Colbert then brought out a basket full of Thin Mints -- Charity Joy’s favorite -- and helped the Girl Scout, her father and Glover hand out boxes to the audience.

Now bargain brides can look like Pippa as £170 royal wedding replica goes on sale  Debenhams recreate Pippa's bridesmaid and evening dresses  ‘Lady-in-Waiting' list created to meet demand  Flower girls and black take on Kate's dress also available  It was the bridesmaid's dress that launched a star. When Pippa Middleton stepped onto the red carpet to pick up sister Kate's train at the royal wedding, the world let out a collective gasp.    With many pontificating on its suitability for a maid-of-honour - many thought it was too bridal for a supporting role - it's no surprise that the dress that so caught the imagination of the public is now the most requested in bridal ateliers - but it's brides, rather than bridesmaids who are besotted.    In response to the demand, department store Debenhams has released its own collection in homage to the royal wedding, and to Pippa in particular.    Inspired: A replica of the dress worn by Pippa Middleton for the Royal Wedding in April is to go on sale at Debenhams for just £170  Desirable: Pippa's Alexander McQueen bridesmaid's dress won her the adulation of the masses - now they can get their hands on a version at Debenhams    But while Pippa's bespoke Alexander McQueen gown cost a staggering £20,000, Debenhams' limited edition version is a snip at just £170.    So great is the anticipated demand that the retailer has taken the unusual step of creating a ‘lady-in-waiting list’ to allow customers to reserve the departments store’s homage to Pippa Middleton’s figure-hugging bridesmaid gown ahead of its launch later this year.  Such is the demand for all things Pippa, the retailer will also stock a £99 version of the emerald green Alice Temperley evening gown that Pippa wore to the evening reception at Buckingham Palace.    Green with envy? The department store has even created a replica of the emerald Alice Temperley gown worn by Pippa for her sister's evening wedding reception  In homage to Kate is a black lace sweetheart cocktail-length dress - inspired by her magnificent Alexander McQueen wedding gown.  There is even a flower girl dress cinched with wide gold ribbon that echoes that of the bridal party, to go on sale for just £48 to £52 depending on age .  Russell Fish, head of occasionwear design at Debenhams said: 'Like everyone we were glued to our tellies for the wedding and have been huge Kate and Pippa fans ever since.  Royal style: In homage to Kate's magnificent Alexander McQueen wedding gown, Debenhams will sell a black lace cocktail-length dress  Small wonders: Completing the Royal Wedding-inspired line is a flower girl dress, to sell for just £48 to £52 depending on age  'We taken the best of the dresses and added our designer twist. Now you can get the Middletons’ look at High Street prices.'  Alain Mehada, chief personal shopper at Debenhams' Oxford Street flagship, added: 'Both men and women everywhere were instantly talking about Pippa, so naturally brides-to-be will want to emulate her classic look – both for themselves or their bridesmaids.	1

Taylor Swift, Katy Perry. Photo: Getty Images  It’s been quite the month in Katy Perry news: She gave a boy his first kiss on American Idol and has been embroiled in a legal battle with a group of nuns over property in L.A. But amid all of that, Perry is still giving the people what they really want — reasons to believe she dislikes Taylor Swift.  When a contestant on American Idol apologized to Perry for saying that he loved Swift and looked up to her as a musician, Perry said, “I love her, as a songwriter, as well.” Then she made a face most accurately described as “¯\_(ツ)_/¯” and looked away.  The two singers have been publicly feuding since Swift called them “enemies” in a 2014 Rolling Stone interview. They’ve been fueling the feud fire ever since, most recently when Perry may have seduced Karlie Kloss away from Swift’s girl gang. But hey, she loves Swift as a songwriter still!	0

Amy Sherman-Palladino got her wish. Amazon has renewed “The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel” for a third season.  The creator-executive producer of “Mrs. Maisel” prodded Amazon executives about a pickup on Saturday night as she accepted a Peabody Award for her 1950s-set dramedy about an Upper West Side housewife who ventures into standup comedy after her picture-perfect marriage falls apart.  “You’re going to give it to us because we’re bringing home the fancy thing, right?” Sherman-Palladino said of the Peabody win for the show’s freshman season.  Amazon Studios head Jennifer Salke, who attended the ceremony at Cipriani Wall Street, confirmed after the kudos concluded that “Mrs. Maisel” would indeed get a greenlight for a third season. “Mrs. Maisel” was initially ordered by the previous Amazon regime with a two season commitment spread across 18 episodes. Season 3 will likely get 10 installments.  Season 1 of “Mrs. Maisel” bowed in late November. Season 2 is set to premiere later this year.  “Mrs. Maisel” also bagged two Golden Globes in January for comedy series and lead comedy actress for star Rachel Brosnahan. With the Globes and Peabody win, the show is seen as a prime contender in the upcoming Emmy race.  Sherman-Palladino made her mark as the creator and showrunner of “Gilmore Girls,” the much-praised drama starring Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel that ran on the WB Network and CW from 2000 through 2007. Sherman-Palladino and Dan Palladino produced four sequel episodes of “Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life” that premiered on Netflix in November 2016.  (Pictured: “Mrs. Maisel’s” Dan Palladino, Rachel Brosnahan, Marin Hinkle, Michael Zegen, and Amy Sherman-Palladino at Saturday’s 77th annual Peabody Awards)	1

She was there for all my other sisters.  “She's just very, very nurturing. So she really helped me through the whole thing. Everyone should have Khloe in their delivery room. It was so much fun [being pregnant at the same time as Khloe],” she continued.  Instagram/KylieJenner  “We would just experience everything together. I was a little bit ahead of her, so we were both doing it for the first time and I would just like warn her of things that happened… the amazing things that are going on, and feeling the baby for the first time. So we would talk, like, on a daily basis about everything.”  Too cute.	1

"Meghan Markle's first husband, Trevor Engelson, got married to Tracey Kurland, a nutritionist, over the weekend, DailyMailTV reports. The couple had a low-key ceremony at a private home in Hidden Hills, California, according to the site.  The nuptials—which took place almost five months after Meghan and Prince Harry's royal wedding—were so secretive that barely any photos from the event surfaced online. But a few Instagram Stories captured by DailyMailTV give a glimpse at Engelson and Kurland's big day.  The images show Engelson wearing a light pink shirt under a gray-blue suit, with the bride in an off-the-shoulder, knee-length white dress with layered gold bracelets. She wore her hair in loose ombré waves.  Getty Images  Markle and Engelson were married from 2011 to 2013. They had a getaway wedding in 2011 in Ocho Rios, Jamaica with 102 guests, according to Us Weekly. For the beachfront nuptials, the bride wore a strapless sheath gown with a notch neckline and bejeweled belt. The laid-back, bohemian-inspired look was fitting for the shoreside venue, but a far cry from the Givenchy Haute Couture gown Markle had custom-made for her royal wedding to Prince Harry.  WPA Pool Getty Images  Engelson's engagement to Kurland was reported in June, just weeks after Meghan and Harry tied the knot. The producer announced the news on Instagram, although his account is private. ""Luckiest guy I know! Get ready to party!"" he wrote in a post.  Meghan and Harry have been to a number of weddings together since becoming a couple; they attended a friend's nuptials months after celebrating their own and are expected to be at Princess Eugenie's ceremony this Friday."	1
    Ready when you are! Pregnant Khloé Kardashian is not-so-patiently waiting for the arrival of her first child — and preparing for labor as she counts down the days.  The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, 33, shared a series of videos on Snapchat on Saturday, April 7, wearing a black Nike shirt, sweatpants and a bandanna. In one shot, she rocked back and forth on an exercise ball while using the app’s bunny filter and said, “Birthing ball life, em-hmm.” (The ball is commonly used by pregnant women to relieve back pain and is said to help get the baby into a better position during labor.)  A post shared by Khloe Kardashian Snapchats❕ (@khloesnapchats) on Apr 7, 2018 at 10:41pm PDT  Kardashian also shared selfies using other filters, including one she captioned, “Bored AF.”  The Strong Looks Better Naked author is expecting her first child — a girl — with boyfriend Tristan Thompson any day now. She revealed the baby’s gender on an episode of the hit E! series.  In the meantime, the always-organized reality personality is keeping busy finalizing last-minute details before the big day. The Revenge Body star shared on her app on Friday, April 6, that her hospital bag is ready to go with “lots of comfy things” for her and the baby, including going-home outfits for both. She also revealed that her computer and charger, camera and favorite Barefoot Dreams blanket are also packed up.  Us Weekly exclusively reported that Kardashian will give birth in Ohio, where she and Thompson, who plays for the Cleveland Cavaliers, share a home. Her mother, Kris Jenner, will also be in attendance to welcome the birth of her ninth grandchild.	1
Justin Bieber told hundreds of people at a Bible study class in Los Angeles that Hollywood elites killed his unborn child and destroyed the relationship he had with the child’s mother, Selena Gomez, as a way of punishing him.  Since finding God last year, Bieber has become a regular at the Bible study class held at the Montage in Beverly Hills and on Wednesday he shared what he called “the worst moment in my life” with the congregation and explained why he had to retire from the music industry.  Telling churchgoers that he will “never go back” to the “evil music industry” until the “pedophiles and monsters at the top of the game are run out of town” and everything is “disinfected with bleach and sunshine,” Bieber explained how Hollywood elites tried to corrupt him.  “They tried so hard to corrupt me,” Bieber said, “because I reached a level they couldn’t control anymore.”  “They tried to destroy me with alcohol and when that didn’t work they tried with drugs – all different kinds. Then when that didn’t work they tried to destroy me with ambition.”  “I was interested at first,” Bieber acknowledged, before saying “but when I realized what the price of admission is in that world, I had to quit.”  “Selena and I were expecting. It was early days and we hadn’t told anyone. At the same time I was being courted by some really powerful people, the most powerful people in Hollywood.”  Describing a top-secret party attended by record industry executives, Bieber said he was shown into a back room where a group of men wearing masks were sitting around the edge of the room, drinking from cups. In the center of the room a dead child was sitting cross-legged, propped up against the back of a chair. It looked like a late-stage fetus and was completely drained of blood.  “The baby’s entire scalp wasn’t there. Its skull had been stripped down to the surface of the bone. Portions of the right side of its undeveloped little face had been torn away. You could see bite marks and bruises all over its tiny body.”  “They were wearing animal masks, sitting around drinking what they called ‘red wine.’ They offered me some. It was obvious that it was really important for them that I got involved.  “I literally gagged at this point. One of them boasted the baby had been alive for eight hours after they started cutting it and draining its blood.”  “When he described the pain the baby went through, he seemed pleased with himself.”  The horrific death described by Bieber to his congregation is called “exsanguination”, otherwise known as completely draining a person of blood. The practice is popular among drinkers of baby blood who consume what they call “red wine” in order to get high on the adrenaline, young hormones, and negative energy they believe is found in the blood of children.  They believe the more a child suffers before its death, the more “enriched” its blood will be upon harvest. Often the child is physically and sexually abused before it is killed in order to create the necessary trauma.  Bieber refused to drink the blood and that is when “everything started going wrong.”  “They threatened me. They said they knew Selena was pregnant. They asked if I wanted my baby to end up like the one in the center of the room.”  “This completely flipped me out and I lost my way for a long time. I went off the rails,” said Bieber, fighting back tears. “They murdered my unborn child. Me and Selena… we were driven apart by these people and the trauma.”  But years have passed since the traumatic episode and Bieber has vowed to protect her and become a family man. Acknowledging rumors that the pair are back together, Bieber even hinted he is set to become a family man.  “They won’t lay a hand on my family so help me God,” he said.  “There are truly evil forces at work in the world. God is real. Satan is real,” Bieber said, before exiting the stand.  These latest allegations from Justin Bieber add to the wave of accusations made by celebrities and musicians about t	0

"Kate Hudson Net Worth and salary: Kate Hudson is an American actress, producer and entrepreneur who has a net worth of $80 million dollars. She was born Kate Garry Hudson on April 19, 1979, in Los Angeles, California. Kate came to prominence thanks to the 2001 film ""Almost Famous"". This role not only made her famous, but it also fetched her a Golden Globe and several other major nominations, including a nomination for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. She is the daughter of actress Goldie Hawn and bears more than a passing resemblance to her famous mother. One of Kate's earliest roles came in 1996, when she made her TV debut on the Fox TV series Party of Five (1994-2000). Although she only appeared in one episode titled ""Spring Breaks: Part 1"", this initial experience was enough to uphold her determination to develop a professional acting career of her own. However, it wasn't until 1999 that she started to attract public attention when critics lauded her brilliant portrayal of Cindy in ""200 Cigarettes"", even though the movie itself was a commercial disappointment. She received acclaim for supporting roles in ""Gossip"" and ""Dr T and the Women"" which both were released in 2000. As we mentioned previously, it was her performance in Cameron Crowe's ""Almost Famous"" that proved she was set to follow her mother's footsteps in taking the film industry by storm. In the midst of a whirlwind schedule of fashion shoots and awards shows, she made an appearance in the romantic war drama ""The Four Feathers"", in 2002. Turning out to be a box-office failure, Hudson fired back with the surefire hit as she starred opposite quirky heartthrob Matthew McConaughey in the romantic comedy ""How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days"" in 2003. She continued to establish herself as a highly sought-after actress starring in subsequent productions like Raising Helen (2004), The Skeleton Key (2005), You, Me and Dupree (2006), Fool's Gold (2008), Bride Wars (2009), The Killer Inside Me (2010), Wish I Was Here (2014), Mother's Day (2016) and more.  Fabletics: In July 2013, Kate and two partners founded a subscription athleisure company called Fabletics. Over time the company would eventually grow from being primarily e-commerce based, to operating 22 retail stores. They also operate a menswear line under the label FL2. According to a 2017 Forbes article, the company was at one point valued at $250 million. It's believed that Kate owns 20% of the company as of November 2018. Assuming the $250 million valuation has held, Kate's pre-tax stake would be worth $50 million."	0
"Your life just got exponentially better and more stylish now you've signed up for our newsletter. Fabulousness awaits!  You seriously need to sign up for our newsletter.  Fans were shocked to hear that Robert Pattinson was spotted making out with Katy Perry at an LA restaurant in January. “They sat in the corner and were drinking a lot,” an eyewitness told In Touch at the time. “They came in together really late and stayed until 2 a.m.” The pair were with a group of friends and managed to fly under the radar for most of the night. “They really blended in,” a different eyewitness revealed. “People didn’t even recognize them!”  But don't expect the duo to start walking red carpets together anytime soon. A source tells In Touch the Twilight star is dating multiple women at the moment!  Rob and Katy in 2015. (Photo Credit: Getty Images)  ""He's been playing the field like crazy,"" the source shares. And the revelation will no doubt crush Katy, who believed their fling was something more substantial. ""Katy thinks she's found Mr. Right with Rob, but she's headed for heartache,"" the source adds.  In fact, the 31-year-old hooked up with his Damsel co-star Mia Wasikowska during the Sundance Film Festival last month before jumping to Katy. ""Rob's a player now, simple as that,"" the source says.  Rob and Mia. (Photo Credit: Getty Images)  As In Touch previously reported, Robert has also been linked to his former Harry Potter co-star Emma Watson, whom he presented with at the 2018 Golden Globes. “They’ve been texting and enjoying secret dinners together in LA and London,” an insider revealed. ""They share the same sense of humor and have so much in common. They’ve always had chemistry, but the timing has never been right — until now.”  As fans know, Rob went through a very public breakup with girlfriend of five years Kristen Stewart in 2013, and broke off his engagement to singer FKA twigs just last year, so we can understand why he'd want to avoid getting into another serious relationship.

    Milo Ventimiglia is asking fans to “forgive” in a hilarious — yet bittersweet — promo ahead ofhighly anticipated episode following the Super Bowl on Sunday, February 4.  “The big game is fast approaching and for many of us, this day brings us an opportunity to gather with friends and family, loved ones we don’t get to see all that often,” Ventimiglia, who plays Jack Pearson on the hit show, begins.  “But in 2018, gathering friends and family, well, it’s not as easy as what it used to be. The country is divided. Sometimes that can make it tough to find common ground, but this year … this year, I think we should all take a deep breath, find the ability to forgive, and remind ourselves there is no difference so great that we can’t overcome it,” the Gilmore Girls alum, 39, concludes, before scooping chili out of a Crock-Pot into a bowl as the hashtag #CrockPotIsInnocent appears on the screen.  The promo is in response to the January 23 episode of This Is Us, which ended with Jack walking around the kitchen, tidying up. Before heading to bed, he turns off the family’s Crock-Pot — but due to its old age and faulty switch, the slow cooker switched back on and started a fire that many believe took the beloved character’s life. Following the episode, upset fans tweeted about Crock-Pots, with many saying they refuse to use the household appliance.  The outrage prompted series creator Dan Fogelman to tweet, “Taking a moment to remind everyone that it was a 20 year old fictional crockpot with an already funky switch? Let’s not just lump all those lovely hardworking crockpots together.”  Crock-Pot released its own statement a few days later, assuring viewers that the product is safe to use: “Crock-Pot understands the concerns brought up by the recent episode of This Is Us, and we too are heartbroken by the latest development in Jack’s story line. However, it is important that our consumers understand and have confidence that all Crock-Pot slow cookers exceed all internal testing protocols and all applicable industry safety standards and regulations as verified by independent third-party testing labs. For nearly 50 years, with over 100 million Crock-Pots sold, we have never received any consumer complaints similar to the fictional events portrayed in last night’s episode. In fact, the safety and design of our product renders this type of event nearly impossible.”  “Our hope is that the team at NBC’s This Is Us will help us spread factual information regarding our product’s safety. While we know their primary mission is to entertain – something they have continued to excel in – we also feel they have a responsibility to inform,” the statement concluded. “Just like many fans, we will be watching next week’s episode to see how Jack’s story progresses and, regardless of the outcome, we want consumers first and foremost to know they are safe when using their Crock-Pot.”  As loyal fans of the hit NBC series know, this Sunday’s episode of This Is Us is going to be a big one: viewers will finally find out what caused Jack’s death. In an exclusive interview with Us Weekly, the Rocky Balboa star promised he is here for Us, saying he is open to giving heartbroken fans “hugs” following the devastating reveal.	1

Kanye West gave Travis Scott a warning about how he treats Kylie Jenner. A source close to the Kardashians EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com Ye’s ultimatum.  You know things are tense between Travis Scott, 25, and Kylie Jenner, 20, when Kanye West, 40, has to step in to talk some sense into the rapper about spending time with Kylie and their soon-to-be-born child. A source close to the Kardashian brood EXCLUSIVELY told us how Kanye tried to make Travis understand the importance of family, especially with Kylie expecting. “Kanye had a serious man to man talk with Travis about becoming a father at the Christmas party this week,” our source said. “It was an emotional conversation as Kanye explained to Travis how wonderful it is becoming a father for the first time, how his whole life is about to change for the better. It was a beautiful, sweet moment between the two guys, but there was also an important point Kanye wanted to make to the younger rapper.”  So, what were the wise words of advice and warning Kanye imparted to his younger protege? Man up. “Kanye made it clear to Travis that he needs to step it up big time,” our source added. “Kanye is protective of all of his family and wanted Travis to know that he better not let Kylie down in anyway once the baby arrives, ’cause Kanye will be watching.” And Travis certainly does not want to let Kanye down — especially considering the fact Kanye is his idol.  We reported earlier how Kim Kardashian, 37, had asked Kanye to talk some sense into Travis, and while he was apparently reluctant to do so, it seems that Yeezy pulled through in a big way. Time will tell whether or not Kanye’s words had an effect on Travis and if the 25-year-old rapper quits hitting up the strip club for good. Click here to see pics of celebs, including Kylie, who had the sexiest selfies of 2017.  HollywoodLifers, do you think Kanye got through to Travis?

News reports say Kim Jong-hyun, 27, was unconscious when taken to hospital and suggest cause of death was suicide  This article is more than 1 year old  This article is more than 1 year old  Kim Jong-hyun, the lead singer of the hugely popular and influential South Korean boyband SHINee, has died at the age of 27.  The star, better known as Jonghyun, was found unconscious at his home in Seoul on Monday evening in an apparent suicide, South Korean media reported.  SHINee were formed in 2008 by the South Korean company SM Entertainment, and belong to the genre known as K-pop – a highly visual form of Korean pop that incorporates elements of western music. They went on to achieve great success in their home country, selling hundreds of thousands of albums and singles.    In 2011, they broke the Japanese market and went on to become one of the most successful South Korean acts in the country: the Japanese-language version of their single Replay sold more than 100,000 copies there.  K-pop singer Jonghyun's death turns spotlight on pressures of stardom Read more  News of Kim’s death prompted a flurry of messages on social media, with many fans voicing disbelief.  A Twitter account devoted to K-pop photos said: “Sending our deepest condolences to SHINee Jonghyun and those who known him well. If you’re going through a hard time, please do know that you never walk alone. Talk to someone and take care of yourself.”  Another Twitter user wrote: “Today we lost one of the most talented artists in Korea. I’m heartbroken and devastated by the news.”  Police arrived at Kim’s apartment after receiving an emergency call from his sister, according to South Korean media. The singer was taken to a nearby hospital and was later pronounced dead, police said.  The Yonhap agency reported that Kim’s sister had received a text message from her brother shortly before his death that read: “Please let me go. Tell me I did well. Final farewell.”  The five-member boyband, with Kim as their main vocalist, released their debut album, The SHINee World, in 2008. They have since released five more Korean albums and another five aimed at the Japanese market – the most recent in January this year. All of their Korean albums except their debut have topped the charts in their home country.  SHINee are considered among the best live performers in K-pop and have won multiple awards for their complex dance routines. They have also become known for setting trends in South Korea – including popularising skinny jeans. The group are frequently referred to by the moniker “the princes of K-pop”.  Kim also had a successful career as a solo singer-songwriter. He released three records: an album called She Is in 2016, which topped the Korean charts, and two compilations in 2015 and 2017. In 2015, he released a book called Skeleton Flower, which detailed the stories behind his songs. In 2010, along with other major Korean artists, he contributed vocals to Let’s Go, a campaign song for the G20 summit, which was held in Seoul.  Throughout his career he collaborated with numerous other Korean artists and also hosted his own radio show on the Korean station MBC.  Kim last appeared in public at a solo concert in Seoul this month.	1

2017 Kennedy Center Honoree Gloria Estefan attends the 40th Annual Kennedy Center Honors at The Kennedy Center on Sunday, Dec. 3, 2017, in Washington. Greg Allen/Invision/AP  Gloria Estefan was part of the select group of entertainers recognized at the Kennedy Center Honors for their contribution to the development of the arts in the United States.  The ceremony was held on Saturday at the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington D.C.  The list of award recipients included singer Lionel Richie, hip hop artist LL Cool J, television producer Norman Lear and dancer Carmen de Lavallade.

Rubenstein are photographed following the State Department dinner for the Kennedy Center Honors, Saturday, Dec. 2, 2017, in Washington. (AP Photo/Kevin Wolf) Kevin Wolf AP  “This award is the best example of what immigrants can do to contribute to the richness of this country,” Estefan told the Nuevo Herald on Monday. “And in the personal sphere, it represents a way of honoring my father [José Fajardo, 1933-1980] who thanked President Kennedy shortly before he was assassinated, for having taken him out of prison in Cuba [after participating in the Bay of Pigs invasion].”  The 60-year-old singer emotionally added that the award also goes to her mother, Gloria Fajardo, who died in June.  On the decision of President Donald Trump and the first lady, Melania Trump, not to attend the Kennedy Center event, the singer said: “I thought it was very sensible that President Donald Trump and his wife did not attend the ceremony. Otherwise, it would have become a political event and not an opportunity to pay homage to the artists.”  This is the first time in more than 20 years that a president has missed the annual celebration of artistic excellence. In August, the White House said that the presidential couple would decline the invitation so that the honorees could celebrate “without any political distraction.”  Estefan did not spend any more time talking about Trump. Instead, she is looking ahead to January when her musical “On Your Feet,” about her career beginnings with husband Emilio Estefan, “which is already being presented in the Netherlands,” will begin a run in Washington, D.C. And in 2018 she will record an album of Brazilian music.  “Christmas will be spent in Miami,” she concluded.  The ceremony will air on Tuesday, Dec. 26 on CBS, at 9 p.m.  Follow Arturo Arias-Polo on Twitter: @arturoariaspolo	1

You’ve been invited to be a bridesmaid in your friend’s wedding, and you know what that means: bachelorette party! It is by far the most fun of the bridal party’s duties, but it can also be one of the priciest. Even if you’re not heading out of town (and thereby skipping flights, hotels, and car restaurants), the cost of planning can still add up when you throw in dinner, drinks, transportation, and decor. Who foots the growing bill? We turned to the experts to help break down who pays for the bridal party.  Traditionally, the only person who doesn’t pay for the bachelorette party is the bride. Especially for an in-town party that’s a single night out instead of a weekend away, the bridesmaids and other guests will often chip in to cover the bride’s share, as well as cover their own costs. That’s one upside to heading out on the town with a bigger group!  For a destination bachelorette bash, however, that rule doesn’t usually apply. Since there’s travel and lodging involved, plus multiple meals out, the bride will also contribute to help cover the expenses. You may all decide to treat the bride to one night on the town, but she’ll have to take out her wallet to cover that hangover brunch the next day.  While you’re still in the planning process, keep the bride in the loop so she (and all of the attendees!) have an idea of how much they’ll be expected to spend. Consider Airbnb over a pricey hotel suite, and look at options in a few price ranges to find something that works for everyone. As you’re planning activities and meals, be sure to share pricing information so the guests can start budgeting. Make pricier activities (like a massage at a high-end spa) optional, and fill in-between time with low-cost or free choices (like a local hike or an afternoon window shopping that everyone can participate in.	1

Earlier this week Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from the World War Z actor after 12 years together, two of which of marriage, and in a statement declared it was for the 'health of the family'.  While speculation has been rife over the differing parenting styles.  Pitt, 52, had previously described the “chaos” inside their family life.  “That's morning time in our house. It's chaos from morning until the lights go out, and sometimes after that,” he said.  (Image: Getty Images)  While Brad might have been joking, a number of former nannies have spoken out about what it was like to look after the children.  One nanny had told In Touch magazine that the six children - Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Knox and Vivienne, eight – were constantly fighting as children do.  They also made with wild allegations that Maddox – who was then nine – tasted drunk wine, and was able to drive a vehicle around one of the family's sizeable properties.  The nanny claimed that the children would quite often ignore bed time rules, as they said: “They have no control over the kids.  ""In the middle of the night they're running down the hallway waking their parents up and trying to get into their beds.”  (Image: Fameflynet)  (Image: Rex Features)  By The Sea actor Brad has previously laughed about the madness of the Jolie-Pitt household, claiming that they had to flee to hotels to get peace.  “You got to leave,” he reportedly said with a laugh.  It's been claimed that the family used to hire six nannies for each of the children, with Angelina's brother James Haven reportedly taking on chief responsibility of caring for the children in recent times. Now, the family use two further nannies as well as tutors, according to MailOnline.  The multi-cultural family would often travel the world, some of which in different groups, from visiting metropolitan cities, to war zones and refugee camps as well as visits back to the adopted children's homelands.  (Image: FameFlynet.uk.com) (Image: Splash News)  While Maddox went to a Lycee Francais school in Los Angeles several years ago, the six children are all home-schooled but now, it's been reported that as they approach their teens, Angelina is keen for them to go to school for “socialisation”.  But their unconventional upbringings has raised eyebrows over the years.  When her eldest son, Maddox, was six-years-old, Changeling star Angelina revealed that her son was obsessed with weapons.

When Maddox turned seven, his interests hadn't changed and Angelina was happy to oblige.  “My mum took me to buy my first daggers when I was 11 or 12, and I've already bought Maddox some,” they said.  Brad and Angelina also have been supportive towards their daughter Shiloh, who has dressed like a boy since she was just three-years-old.  Brad had previously said: “We've got to call her John”.

Trafficked to UK aged 5, kept as a slave for a decade and beaten every day: Teen breaks silence over harrowing upbringing among family she believed was her own  EXCLUSIVE by DANIEL FOSTER    Two weeks ago the horrific story of a girl who was trafficked to Britain for a life of domestic slavery at the age of five came to light.  Speaking exclusively to Mail Online the girl, now 18, gives a heart-rending account of her lonely violence-fuelled upbringing in the North London home where she lived as a prisoner and was forced to endure almost daily beatings.  She was so young when she was brought from Nigeria to the UK that she was convinced the couple who set her to work in their house were her parents.    The extraordinary ordeal suffered by the girl, known in court as 'Y', emerged during a hearing to decide whether she should have been entitled to benefits and support when she finally escaped her life of slavery.  *Names have been changed    A life of servitude: The girl couldn't remember what her parents looked like  I was born in Nigeria. I don’t know where – I can’t remember and nobody told me. I can’t remember anything about life in Nigeria. I don’t know who my parents are or whether I have any brothers or sisters. No one has ever told me about my family. I only know my date of birth because I found it written down in the house where I grew up in England.  The first things I remember all happened in the United Kingdom. I lived with a family in London. The family was made up of a woman, her husband, their daughter and their son. There was also a boy who I believe was a cousin of the mother. He didn’t live with us the whole time, but he did live in the family for long periods of time.  When I was little I called the adults mum and dad and thought I was their child, but they treated me differently to their daughter and from the brother when he was born. They went to school, but I wasn’t allowed. They smacked me and beat me but they didn’t do the same to the other children. I had to do work around the house which the other children didn’t. I couldn’t ask them why they treated me differently, in my culture it’s rude to question adults and you just have to accept what they say.  Nobody explained to me why I was treated differently. Nobody came out and told me that I wasn’t their child. When I was a little girl they made it very clear that I was different from their family, but I didn’t really understand why as this was the only life I could remember.  The first memories I have from living with the family are the mother staying at home with me during the daytime. She was a big woman, huge, I was terrified of her. I think I was five years old when I started living with them because I remember the daughter going to school and we were roughly the same age.  I didn’t ask why she went to school and I didn’t because it was not the sort of house where a little girl could ask questions. I had to do what I was told or I would be beaten. The other children had toys and books of their own but I didn’t have any. I was allowed to read their books, and I could play with other children’s toys when I had the time, but I had no toys and books of my own.    'THE BABY AND I FORMED A BOND'    I had to stay at home most of the time, whether or not the rest of the family were there. Although the mother was at home when I first lived there, not long afterwards she started going back to work and I would be left at home in the house. I think I was about six or seven when the brother was born. I remember when he was old enough to sit up by himself or crawl. The mother went back to work and left the baby at home with me. I had to look after him all day.

"Amal Clooney has given birth to twins, Ella and Alexander, Clooney’s publicist to the Associated Press. The boy and girl are the first children for the attorney and her husband, George Clooney.  Clooney's rep has also already weighed in with some humor:  Julie Chen, a friend of the couple, first announced the Clooney’s pregnancy news on her CBS show, The Talk, in February. Since then, Amal Clooney has been spotted with her husband at the Cesar Awards in February and at the United Nations in March; she has been continuing her work as a human-rights lawyer, which she has done since the early 2000s.  George Clooney, who was one of Hollywood's most famous bachelors before marrying Amal in September 2014 at the age of 53, told People in February that his friends, whose children are all grown and in college, had taken to jokingly ribbing him about his late-in-life fatherhood. Despite the quips from his pals, Clooney was ready to take on the challenge.  “Look, it’s exciting,” Clooney said. “And we’re really happy and really excited, and it’s going to be an adventure. We’ve sort of embraced it all . . . with arms wide open.”  WATCH: Celebrity Parents Who Have Twins  Julia Roberts, mother of twins and Clooney's longtime pal, has already stepped in with advice for the new dad, per People.  “There’s no such thing as wisdom when you have twin babies in the house,” she said. “There’s just hopes and prayers and tears and holding on tight to each other.”  The Clooneys will reportedly raise their twins in London, where they have been living in the months leading up to the babies’ birth.  Friends are already weighing in on how the 56-year-old will be as a brand new father. Matt Damon added his insight in an interview with Entertainment Tonight:  “He’ll be great, he’ll be a mess, but [Amal] will take care of everything."""	1

Angelina Jolie Begs Tom Ford For Help Resurrecting Her Career  Angelina Jolie is ready to get her groove back and is enlisting fashion guru Tom Ford to help!  “With all the drama around her and Brad Pitt, Angelina feels like a huge outsider right now,  and she knows Tom is the industry It Guy,” tattles a fashion insider.  Tom was the mastermind behind Gucci and Saint Laurent before launching his own line,  and has gone on to direct two Oscar-nominated flicks, A Single Man and Nocturnal Animals.  Now he’s ready to make the newly single actress his latest project.  “Angelina is the most beautiful woman in the world, and it kills Tom  to see her in these depressing all-black ensembles and dowdy red carpet gowns,” says the source.  “He wants to do a couture line with her and get her back to icon status.”  Are vials of blood about to be back in fashion?	0
The title of ABC’s upcoming “Grey’s Anatomy” spinoff has finally been revealed. The series, which comes from showrunner Stacy McKee, will be called “Station 19.”  Series executive producer Paris Barclay announced the title on Twitter on Thursday, saying, “Welcome all of them to @STATION19 #greysanatomy spin-off.”  The spinoff is set at Seattle Fire Station 19 in Seattle, Wash., in the same universe as “Grey’s Anatomy” and will see Jason George’s Dr. Ben Warren giving up his life as a surgeon to become a firefighter. With his new firehouse home being just blocks away from Grey Sloan Memorial, producers of the show have said there may be opportunity to see some characters crossover between the two series.  At the Alphabet’s Television Critics Assn. press tour panel in early January 2018, McKee said they were still considering a few options for the show’s title. ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey noted that “coming up with a title is one of the most challenging things we do” and pointed out that the network executives at the time did not select a title for “Grey’s Anatomy” until right before that series debuted in 2005, either.  “We really want to make sure that what we settle on is perfect,” Dungey said.  “Station 19,” which falls under Shonda Rhimes’ Shondaland banner, stars George, Jaina Lee Ortiz, Grey Damon, Barrett Doss, Alberto Frezza, Jay Hayden, Okieriete Onaodowan, Danielle Savre and Miguel Sandoval.  Ortiz also announced the title on Twitter, with a little bonus video from the cast:  “Station 19” will premiere with a special two-hour event on ABC Mar. 22 before taking its usual “TGIT” time slot of 9 p.m. on Mar. 29.	1

Today is National Wine Day—one of those mysterious holidays that seem to spring fully formed from your Facebook or Twitter feed. A Google search leaves the holiday’s origins ambiguous but seems to at least source it to a year: 2009. So happy Seventh-Annual National Wine Day, everyone. Who are we to argue with such a fantastic idea? To put you in the mood to guzzle some grapes, here are 20 TV characters who know their way around a bottle. Let their hardy livers inspire you.  Tyrion Lannister—Game of Thrones  The shortest member of the Lannister clan is, nonetheless, its most accomplished drinker. Ever since Tyrion made his first appearance in the pilot he’s not been too far from a wine bottle, goblet, or skin.  Cersei Lannister—Game of Thrones  But if anyone could give Tyrion a run for his money in the drinking department, it’s his sister: Cersei. The thirst she developed when holed up during the Battle of the Blackwater in Season 2 has only increased in the intervening years. Maybe if she had been drinking less and scheming more, Season 5 wouldn’t have gone quite so terribly for her.  Alicia Florrick—The Good Wife  Alicia recently got in trouble with her neighbors for running a law office out of her swanky Chicago apartment. But if I shared a recycling bin with the Florrick household, I would have raised a few flags long before. But, as Alicia puts it, she doesn’t need wine—she likes wine. For the record, she likes tequila too.  Lindsay Jillian—You’re the Worst  Any one of the four core characters on this show could have cropped up here but somehow I think Linds is the most inclined to prefer wine. It’s classy, just like her. I’ll see you all back here on National Trash Juice Day when we celebrate all things Vernon.  Robin Scherbatsky—How I Met Your Mother  It’s possible now that she’s found a happily ever after with Ted, Robin is less inclined to drink under a desk while weeping. Then again, when Ted gets out his red cowboy boots, we won’t blame Robin for taking a deep swig, or 20.  The Cul-de-sac Crew—Cougar Town  If you don’t have a Big Carl or Big Joe to call your very own, then fill the closest vase with all the wine you have, make fun of your neighbors, play Penny Can, and fondly remember this late, great show.  Tami Taylor—Friday Night Lights  Truth be told, both Eric and Tami Taylor enjoyed unwinding with a glass of wine, but I decided to put Mrs. Coach on here because . . .  Amy Schumer—Inside Amy Schumer  . . . Amy Schumer paid such a beautiful homage to Connie Britton’s character in her sketch “Football Town Nights.” Bleary eyes, full glass, can’t lose.  Bernard Black—Black Books  I don’t recommend trying Bernard Black’s wine popsicle (or ice lolly if you’re British) at home. Freezing a full, glass wine bottle sounds like a recipe for disaster. But if you can pull it off, more power to you, and may I suggest a nice rosé?  Liz Lemon—30 Rock  You know what pairs well with Night Cheese? Treadmill wine. But if neither of those sounds good, you might want to try some of Liz Lemon’s patented Funky Juice. Find the recipe here.  Hannibal Lecter—Hannibal  What good is an elegantly prepared meal without a nice Chianti to wash it down?  Carrie Mathison—Homeland  I don’t, however, recommend you wash down your meds with wine. But if you do, make sure you’re ready to blow your life up completely and repeatedly.  Kathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb—The Today Show  O.K., yes, Kathie Lee and Hoda aren’t exactly characters, but, well, aren’t they? Like Tami Taylor before her, Kathie Lee got her own loving send-up courtesy of *S.N.L.’*s Kristen Wiig. Wiig’s preferred accessory? A wine glass, of course.  Edina Monsoon and Patsy Stone—Absolutely Fabulous  Eddie and Patsy—maybe the original Hoda and Kathie Lee?—are back in the news today thanks to the teaser for their upcoming movie. As you might expect, the women have not changed their hard-drinking ways one bit. You wouldn’t want it any other way, would you, sweetie darling?  Skyler White	1
Jamie Foxx walked off an interview with ESPN after the host asked the Academy Award-winning actor about his rumored relationship with actress Katie Holmes.  Foxx, 50, was speaking with “SportsCenter” host Michael Smith on Friday before the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game in which the actor was playing, E! News reported.  Smith asked Foxx about being prepared for the game before he tried to transition the conversation to the actor's private relationship with Holmes, 39.  “And I know you’ve prepared and I saw pictures,” Smith asked. “Did you and Katie Holmes play basketball for Valentine’s Day? Like some real ‘Love and Basketball’?”  TED CRUZ ACCUSES CNN OF SITTING ON INTERVIEW AFTER CHRIS CUOMO SAID HE’S ‘AFRAID’ TO APPEAR ON NETWORK  Foxx did not answer but instead took off his earphones and attempted to take the microphone off before an assistant helped him, as Foxx looked awkwardly into the camera.  The actor then walked off camera and back to the basketball court where he began to do exercises.  “Uh oh, did we lose him?” Smith asked. “Oh, he ready to go, he ready to hoop.”  Foxx and Holmes have kept a low profile of their rumored relationship that reportedly began in 2013. The two were photographed walking together in Los Angeles Wednesday, Valentine’s Day, while carrying a basketball.  A source told People the couple likes to keep their relationship private – especially Foxx.  OPRAH SAYS SHE’S WAITING TO HEAR FROM GOD ABOUT 2020 RUN, AFTER JOY BEHAR MOCKED PENCE FOR LISTENING TO JESUS  “Jamie and Katie’s relationship is not a secret but they both like to keep it under the radar,” the source told the magazine. “They have nothing to hide but Jamie, especially, is very low key about his life in general, and rarely talks about it. He is not one to acknowledge anything about his private life and neither does Katie.”  Foxx’s team, the Clippers, ended up beating the rival team, the Lakers, 75-66. Other celebrities who played included Justin Bieber, Nick Cannon, Drew Scott and Michael B. Jordan.	0
"Story highlights Dykstra tweeted a statement on Wednesday  She thanked fans for their support  (CNN) Chloe Dykstra is speaking out after her ex-boyfriend, TV host Chris Hardwick, denied allegations he sexually and emotionally abused her.

Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston’s rumored late-night rendezvous are making Angelina Jolie see red, as we’ve learned that her ‘strong feelings’ for her ex-husband have left her feeling ‘oddly jealous.’  It didn’t take long for the Brad Pitt, 54, and Jennifer Aniston, 49, reunion rumors to start. Right after she split from Justin Theroux, 46, there were reports that she and Brad were having some low-key, late-night meetings. The rumors have found their way to the ears of Angelina Jolie, 42, and a source close to her EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com that she’s not happy. “Angie does not want to believe that Brad and Jen could be seeing each other again. Angelina feels oddly jealous that Brad could possibly be giving attention to his ex.  “The divorce has been hard on Angelina,” the insider tells HollywoodLife.com, “but she still has very strong feelings for Brad. To know that he could be seeing his ex, Jen, after so much that has happened between all of them, feels like a betrayal and a punch in the gut to Angie. She says she doesn’t want to hear about Brad, but she can’t help but monitor what is being reported.” If Angie is losing sleep, worrying about Brad and Jen hanging out, a second source has EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com that the reports of their meetings are “totally false.”  Angie reportedly shot down a chance to have her own face-to-face with Jen, as In Touch says she rejected Jennifer’s offer for a dinner date. Angie was reportedly “furious” after hearing about the rumored rendezvous, and she just was not in the mood to bury the hatchet with Jen. Considering all the “strong feelings” she still has for her ex-husband, it’s no wonder that the last thing she wants to do is go out to eat with Ms. Aniston.  While Angie is stewing over the reports of her ex hanging out with his other ex, Jen is living her best life. Unlike her split from Brad, this breakup with Justin was “more of a mutual decision,” a source close to her EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com. Plus, she’s “stronger and more grounded,” so she’s been able to handle this divorce better than the split with Brad. She’s even open to dating, and she’s looking for a hot, younger guy to have some fun with.	0
Venus Williams and Garbine Muguruza have beaten some impressive competition and played some incredible tennis thus far, but only one can lift the trophy at The Championships, Wimbledon on Saturday.  Their first match against one another on grass courts is for the most prestigious title you can earn on the surface, The Venus Rosewater Dish.  Saturday’s match will be broadcast by ESPN in the United States, beginning at 9 a.m. ET. ABC will have encore coverage of the match beginning at 3 p.m. Online streaming of the singles final will be available via WatchESPN and via the ESPN App on smartphones and other devices.  For Williams, playing in the Wimbledon final is nothing new. She has won the title five times, last doing so in 2008. That was also the last time she won a Grand Slam, though she came close earlier this year when she played in the Australian Open finals.  Muguruza has also won a Grand Slam title, but just one — taking home the win on the clay of Roland Garros, the French Open. Clay is her better surface, and she beat Williams on said surface in Rome earlier this year. That win was Muguruza’s only victory over Williams, however.  Prior to that, Williams had beaten Muguruza three consecutive times, all on the hard court surface. They have never played each other in a Grand Slam. Muguruza’s win earlier in 2017 was a three-set win, 6-2, 3-6, 6-2. Williams’ 2015 win over Muguruza was cut short when Muguruza had to retire in the second set.  Muguruza took down top seed Angelique Kerber in the fourth round, seventh seed Svetlana Kuznetsova in the quarterfinals and the unseeded Magdalena Rybarikova in the semifinals. Williams bested 27th seed Ana Konjuh in the fourth round, 13th seed and French Open winner Jelena Ostapenko in the quarterfinals and sixth seed Johanna Konta in the semifinals.  The men’s doubles final will be on Centre Court after Muguruza or Williams earns the title. That match sees the fourth-seeded pairing of Lukasz Kubot and Marcelo Melo against the 16th-seeded Oliver Marach and Mate Pavic.  The women’s doubles final is after that, featuring the second-seeded pairing of Ekaterina Makarova and Elena Vesnina taking on the ninth-seeded Hao-Ching Chan and Monica Niculescu.  Below is all you need to know to watch Saturday’s action from The Championships, on television and online.

Though he's been busy releasing new music for the past few weeks, Kanye West has been on his design hustle, too. Last night, the rapper-turned-designer debuted a new campaign for his Yeezy 500 Supermoon sneaker campaign on Twitter, and it turned heads to say the least.  The shots feature a diverse roster of models wearing West’s new footwear, along with other Yeezy pieces like sports bras, leggings, and sweatshirts. But a few models really wore nothing but the shoe. One of them included adult-film actress Lela Star (who has an uncanny resemblance to West's wife, Kim Kardashian).  The campaign was photographed by Eli Linnetz (who shot the 2017 Kardashian Christmas card). He shared another revealing angle from the shoot.  The Clermont twins also made an appearance, wearing only the Supermoon sneakers, socks, and biker shorts.      There was also this faceless model, who posed topless but sported grey shorts, Calabasas socks, and Yeezy kicks.  Not all models were nude. Some wore Yeezy's signature oversized sweaters and biker shorts (à la Kim Kardashian), others even sported jeans.  The roster also included younger-looking models, including a child.  This isn't the first time Kanye has launched a new campaign on social media. For his recent collections, Kim has worn his design in public and shared the paparazzi photos online to debut the clothes. He also enlisted other models including Paris Hilton, Amina Blue, and Sami Miro to pose as Kim lookalikes for the shots, resulting in a full-on social media swarm.	1

A sensational US report has today claimed that Kate Hudson has been 'dumped' by musician boyfriend Danny Fujikawa just days before she is due to give birth.  An insider allegedly told Star magazine that Kate, 39, was struck with a sudden sickness and rushed to hospital weeks before she was due to give birth to her first daughter, with the publication bizarrely claiming that Danny, 32, 'used Kate's health scar to end their relationship.'  'Danny told her he couldn't do this anymore,' the source outrageously alleged. 'Kate was devastated.'  Hudson is already mother to sons Ryder, 14, and Bingham, 7, with rocker ex Chris Robinson and Matthew Bellamy.	0

Justin Bieber’s reputation as a party-loving house-trasher and terrible neighbor is biting him in the butt. Page Six reports that Beverly Hills landowners have banded together to reject Bieber from renting a house in the neighborhood.  An unnamed real estate agent told Page Six that Bieber “wants to rent a big estate, but many of the owners of the big Beverly Hills properties, which are for rent, have clubbed together to agree that nobody should rent to Justin.”  The Canadian pop star is better known for upsetting his neighbors with dangerous driving and random eggings than for his house-destroying parties, but whatever the reason, Beverly Hills residents really don’t want him in their ‘hood. Bieber is reportedly offering well over the asking rent—up to $100,000 a month—and still no one has rented him any of the places he’s interested in.  Cast out of the Bev Hills rental market, poor Bieber has been forced to move into an unidentified posh hotel in the neighborhood. He’s rented quarters in the hotel “for up to a year,” says Page Six.  Bieber has rented in Beverly Hills before, taking up residence in a $59,000-a-month glass house that looks a bit like a glamorous salad spinner. (It was a short-term lease.)	0
(Warning: This post contains spoilers for the midseason return of “This Is Us” Season 3, which aired Tuesday.)  While offering up an overload of emotional information to Pearson family fans back in November, the midseason finale of “This Is Us” Season 3, called “The Beginning Is the End Is the Beginning,” finally gave us the answer to the question viewers have been asking since the second season finale’s shocking flash-forward ending aired last spring: who the “her” is that Future Randall and Future Tess are preparing to visit.  The answer: Randall’s mother, Rebecca Pearson (played by Mandy Moore).  Yes, just as “This Is Us” wrapped up the first half of its third season, it was revealed that decades from now, Randall (Sterling K. Brown) and his adult daughter — along with Toby and now Beth — are going to see “Randall’s mother,” as Beth puts it to her employee (apparently she’s running a ballet company now?), who she obtains a Pin the Tail on the Donkey game from, as she prepares to join Randall and daughter on this journey.  Also Read: 'This Is Us': Sterling K Brown on What That Election Result Means for Randall and Beth - And Future Randall and Future Beth  Though this “her” revelation didn’t come until the episode’s closing moments — which also included a shocking twist about the fate of Jack’s little brother Nicky during the Vietnam War — we were building to it throughout the entire hour of the Dan Fogelman-created series.  The installment included scenes in the present of Rebecca accidentally upsetting young Tess while trying to address her emerging feelings toward other girls, and then relating to her enough so that she felt comfortable addressing them with her parents. The episode also ended with a fight between our Present Day Beth and Randall, because Randall refused to drop out of the city council race, when the polls show he won’t win and his wife asks him to give up and come back to helping his family.  That spat led to Randall sleeping on the couch, and a not so happy vibe between the happy couple in the present, with some hints in the future indicating the two are only communicating between Adult Tess. Does that mean they separate or even divorce?  Also Read: 'This Is Us' Season 3: 'ER' Alum Goran Visnjic Cast as Beth's Teacher on Backstory Episode  “This Is Us” returned from hiatus tonight with an episode that jumped between the past and present — but didn’t head into the future again. So since we didn’t get anymore new hints on screen, TheWrap was able to gather a few clues for you while speaking with Brown about Randall winning the Philadelphia City Council race and how those election results might impact the Pearsons in the present and the future.  TheWrap: How did you feel about the reveal Rebecca is the mysterious future “her” we’ve all been wondering about? How soon are we going to find out why everyone is gathering to see her?  Sterling K. Brown: We’ve all [in the cast] known that it’s Rebecca, though the audience didn’t know, and we know why it’s Rebecca and you guys will find out at the end of the season what it is. Yeah, you’ll see at the end.  End of the season?  End of the season you’ll get a better glimpse of why we’re going to see Rebecca.

Partway through the first episode of American Gods, creators Bryan Fuller and Michael Green let audiences know exactly __what to expect, sexual content-wise, from Starz’s latest foray into the world of fantasy prestige TV. Putting the much-ballyhooed sexual gymnastics of Westeros to shame, American Gods presents a feast for the eyes in the shape of Yetide Badaki’s goddess character, Bilquis, devouring her helpless, worshipful sexual partner in the midst of their first assignation. And, no, she doesn’t use her mouth to do it. That scene is even crazier in the book by Neil Gaiman, but Fuller and Green pulled out all manner of technical trickery to make it play so well on TV.  The scene comes early enough in the season to signal viewers what they might expect in the future of American Gods. (This certainly isn’t the last artfully shot, jaw-dropping sexual encounter of Season 1.) But the Bilquis scene comes even earlier in the book—before the end of the first chapter, in fact. Instead of being a poor, duped victim of Internet dating gone awry, as he is on the show, Bilquis’s victim in the book is a crude “John”—and she, in the parlance of the novel, is a “hooker.” You have much less sympathy for the book victim when she gulps him down.  Almost everything else goes similarly in both novel and show. Bilquis asks to be worshipped; her partner obliges, and chants phrases that no John (or poor Internet Dater) could possibly know.

"[This story contains spoilers from Grey's Anatomy's 14th season finale, ""All of Me.""]  Grey's Anatomy star Ellen Pompeo previewed that the season 14 exits for co-stars Sarah Drew (April) and Arizona (Jessica Capshaw) would not be tragic as ""you only get killed off [the show] when your behavior is bad.""  And judging from how Thursday's finale ended for both departing actresses, it's clear that the ABC medical drama valued Capshaw and Drew as much as their legions of viewers did. News broke in March that Capshaw and Drew — who have been with the Shondaland drama for 10 and nine seasons, respectively — would be departing at the conclusion of the current season.  After a penultimate episode in which Drew's April Kepner came this close to death, the finale jumped forward a few weeks to reveal that she'd quit her job at Grey Sloan Memorial to ""do God's work."" It brought the religious character's crisis-of-faith storyline to a close and was capped off when April and Matthew (Justin Bruening) tied the knot after Alex (Justin Chambers) and Jo's (Camilla Luddington) destination wedding went off the rails. (Don't fret, Alex and Jo got married on a ferry, with Meredith — ordained online — performing the ceremony.)  As for Capshaw's Arizona, well, she got her happily ever after as well. Following her decision to move from Seattle to New York so her daughter, Sofia, could be in the same city with her other mother, Callie (former series regular Sara Ramirez). What's more, Arizona revealed that Callie was now single as well as the former married couple seemed poised to start anew.  Creator Shonda Rhimes acknowledged the duo Thursday after the finale.  I will never stop being grateful for the chance to work with @sarahdrew and @JessicaCapshaw. In April and Arizona, they created powerful unforgettable characters. #GreysAnatomy #TGIT — shonda rhimes (@shondarhimes) May 18, 2018  That Arizona and April would both find love with their respective former flames Callie and Matthew was a fitting way for the onscreen friends to go out together in a season that has increasingly honored its history. In a nod to its roots, the finale also featured a cameo of sorts by Ramirez as her cover of Brandi Carlile's ""The Story"" from the season seven musical was featured during the double-wedding final scene.  The decision to part ways with Capshaw and Drew was a creative one, showrunner Krista Vernoff said, and not based on salary or budget factors after Pompeo inked a new $20 million annual deal that made her TV's highest paid actress on a primetime drama.  ""The suggestion ... that our cast changes are in any way related to Ellen Pompeo's salary renegotiation is wrong and hurtful and misguided,"" wrote Vernoff, who like Pompeo, has been a vocal advocate of salary parity. ""It smacks of an old, broken, patriarchal notion that women must be pitted against each other and that one woman's success will be costly to others.  Capshaw has been with Grey's for 10 seasons, nine as a series regular playing Arizona, the openly gay pediatrics surgeon who was almost immediately embraced by the LGBTQ community. With former star Ramirez, Capshaw was part of one of primetime's first lesbian weddings. The character helped Grey's receive multiple awards from LGBTQ watchdog group GLAAD, while also representing a traditionally underserved community in an era when gay characters were still few and far between.  Drew, with the Shondaland drama for nine seasons (eight as a regular), came in as an intern and has been wildly praised for April's commitment to her Christianity, which was put to the test this season.  ""It's always hard for me to say goodbye to any of my characters. Both Arizona Robbins and April Kepner are not only beloved but iconic — both the LBGTQ and devout Christian communities are underrepresented on TV,"" Rhimes said back in March when news of their departures broke. ""I will be forever grateful to both Jessica and Sarah for bringing these characters to life with such vib"	1

According to US magazine Star, 50-year-old Julia is devastated after months of meetings between herself and Richard, 68, petered out and he’s now consumed with his much younger girlfriend.  Although for years the timing was never right, 'Julia and Richard are undeniably drawn to each other and always have been,' claims a source. So far that has always meant being in the friend zone.  The Hollywood pair are said to have reached out to each other in 2015 when they were both going through a tough time – Julia rumoured to have begun a trial separation with husband Danny Moder late last year.    ‘They both were going through a rough time and poured their hearts out to each other,’ continues the insider, who notes that Richard was going through a messy divorce from second wife, actress Carey Lowell.    ‘Their heart-to-hearts eventually led to discreet dinner dates in L.A, sometimes in private restaurant dining rooms, where they’d be left uninterrupted and could stay past closing hours.’    However, the American Gigolo star eventually got back together with much younger girlfriend Alejandra Silva, 35 – with the pair even rumoured to have secretly eloped with during a trip to France .    ‘Julia spent literally decades loving this man and they have an intense, powerful connection,’ claims the insider to Star of their friendship.    'Of course, she’ll be the first to congratulate Richard, but deep down it’s got to be heartbreaking to see her soul mate commit to someone else.'  Neither party has commented on Star‘s claims.	0
It seemed like Jennifer Aniston finally got her happy ending, but her marriage to Justin Theroux has sadly met its end. After tying the knot on Aug. 5, 2015, the couple seemed to be blissfully wed. Rumors may have been circulating around bumps in their relationship, but we didn’t think they could be true.  Unfortunately, some of the rumors were true — Aniston and Theroux are splitting up. A number of factors come into play with the demise of their relationship, but one, in particular, could be the real reason for their separation (No. 6).  1. They announced their separation in a statement  The couple called it quits in early 2018. | Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images The couple called it quits in early 2018. | Gabriel Bouys/AFP/Getty Images  Although Aniston and Theroux wanted to keep this time in their lives private, they felt it necessary to set the story straight. They released a joint statement about their separation on Feb. 15, 2018, which reads:  In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation. This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.    Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else’s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.  Next: We could see it coming for these reasons.  2. There were some warning signs  The two didn’t celebrate Jennifer Aniston’s birthday together. | Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images The two didn’t celebrate Jennifer Aniston’s birthday together. | Tim Mosenfelder/Getty Images  Rumors had been circulating about their marriage being on the rocks, and granted, there were a few warning signs. For starters, couples will normally share a little birthday love for their spouse, but Theroux stayed silent on Aniston’s 49th birthday on Feb. 11, 2018.  Aniston has also been spotted numerous times without Theroux in the months before their separation announcement. Her Friends co-star, Courtney Cox, joined her for her birthday celebrations in Malibu — but Theroux was nowhere to be found.  Next: They couldn’t ignore these differences.  3. They had major differences from the start  The couple has always had their fair share of differences. | Valerie Macon/AFP/Getty Images The couple has always had their fair share of differences. | Valerie Macon/AFP/Getty Images  Although Theroux and Aniston were very much in love, they had major differences from the start.  A source told E! News, “Jennifer and Justin fell in love hard and fast and yet they were never really suited to one another. He was a New York hipster that loved the alternative lifestyle and Jennifer was living a much more reclusive life when they first started to fall in love.”  The source added, “The initial chemistry between them made it easy for them to ignore their differences and incompatibility.”  Next: This might have kept them from splitting up sooner.  4. They shared a sense of humor  Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux in Wanderlust | Universal Pictures Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux in Wanderlust | Universal Pictures  Both actors have major comedy chops and met while working on the comedy film Wanderlust together, so it comes as no surprise that “[t]hey love to laugh and share a wicked sense of humor.” They also love to joke about one another.  In an interview, Aniston lovingly referred to her husband as a “turkey.” And Theroux, when asked about what he would be getting Aniston for their second anniversary, teased, “Isn’t number two cotton? Am I supposed to get something cotton? So probably just a bag of cotton.”  Next: Keeping up with Aniston’s lifestyle became too much.  5. Theroux prefers	0

"Rest easy, Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott stans. Your favorite Calabasas power couple is still really, really in love. Having just welcomed their daughter into the world, the two sat down to talk love, crying, custom Stormi chains, and more in their GQ cover story. The most shocking detail they revealed? Kylie and Travis never had a first date.  “We don't go on dates,” Kylie confessed. According to the story, the two met at Coachella, although neither remembered where. It was more of a hang-out than a date, but clearly, it went well. After the festival, there wasn’t time to plan an official first date, or even an unofficial second date. Travis was headed to the next stop on his “Birds Eye View” tour, so Kylie left Calabasas to follow him.  “Coachella was one of the stops on his tour,” she explained. “So he said, ‘I'm going back on tour—what do we want to do about this?’ Because we obviously liked each other. And I was like, ‘I guess I'm going with you.” Which is such an epic love risk that even Kylie admitted the move was “crazy romantic.” She continued, “I really jumped on the bus ... And then we rode off into the sunset. I did the whole tour with him.”  As for the Kar-Jenner clan’s thoughts on the whole thing? They apparently respected her decision. As we know, Kylie has always been fiercely independent. “My whole family knows that I do whatever I'm going to do,” Kylie said. “I've been that way my whole life. I don't really answer to anybody. I live on my own, and so I just rode off into the sunset.”  While traveling across the country with your new maybe-boyfriend for three months might sound like a lot of commitment early on, Kylie said touring with Travis not only strengthened their relationship, but protected their privacy.  “We had a lot of downtime,” she recalled. “It was organic. And we would just go to these random cities. We got to not be who we really were. Like, if we were in L.A., I feel like it would've been way different. Everything happened for a reason. We weren't going out as “Kylie and Trav.” We would just be in Cleveland, walking the street for hours. We would go on walks, and no one would bother us.”  Let us slide into your DMs. Sign up for the Teen Vogue daily email.  Want more from Teen Vogue?

"In actuality, it's unlikely that their bliss is related to the newness of their marriage. Because while it's true they're only just celebrating their fourth wedding anniversary today, their love story is some two decades in.  Their first few chapters were admittedly rocky. While playing somewhat hapless lovers Jackie Burkhart and Michael Kelso on That '70s Show in the late '90s, 14-year-old Kunis could not have been less interested in her 19-year-old costar. And she certainly never dreamed her real life first kiss with ""the Calvin Klein model"" was actually her first with her future husband. But several years down the road, after keeping in sporadic touch thanks to AOL Instant Messenger, there was a surprise plot twist.  More than six years and one failed friends-with-benefits pact later Kunis, 35, is thankful for the curveball.

"Actress Jodie Whittaker will become the next actor -- and the first female -- to star as the universe-trotting Timelord in the long-running BBC science fiction series ""Doctor Who.""  Whittaker will become the 13th Doctor in the show's history, taking over for current star Peter Capaldi at the end of this year. Capaldi has starred on the show since 2013, and was the 12th actor to fill the Doctor's shoes since the series made its debut on British television in 1963.

""Because this is a really exciting time, and Doctor Who represents everything that's exciting about change. The fans have lived through so many changes, and this is only a new, different one, not a fearful one,"" she said.  Whittaker also said no persuasion was needed for her to accept the role. ""If you need to be persuaded to do this part, you're not right for this part, and the part isn't right for you.""  In addition to Capaldi, actors who played the role on TV were William Hartnell, Patrick Troughton, Jon Pertwee, Tom Baker, Peter Davison, Colin Baker, Sylvester McCoy, Paul McGann, Christopher Eccleston., David Tennant and Matt Smith.

"How much did you spend on your actual home? Well, Miranda Kerr has already spent that much on the nursery for her unborn child, according to a new report.  Kento Nara/Future Image/WENN.com  A source told Life & Style that the model and her husband, Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel, have already dropped $250,000 on the nursery.  The insider tells the mag that the couple is ""super excited"" about welcoming a child into their lives, adding that the baby's nursery contains a custom-made crib and a walk-in closet filled with designer baby clothes from Dior, Stella McCartney, and Ralph Lauren.  ""She isn't holding back when it comes to giving her newborn the best of the best!,"" the source said.

    Fans have always longed for ’90s golden couple Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston to get back together — something Justin Theroux became keenly aware of two years ago when he found love notes Aniston had saved from the heartthrob, a source recalls in the new issue of Us Weekly.  “He stumbled upon old Post-it notes Brad had written,” a source tells Us. “Sweet little Post-its like, ‘You looked nice tonight’ or ‘Miss you already.’”  The source explains that impact of those little notes was huge. “Jen assured him they weren’t a big deal, but Justin wasn’t thrilled … Justin had moments of insecurity like that.”  As previously reported, Aniston, 49, and Theroux, 46, announced their separation on Thursday, February 15, via a joint statement: “In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation. This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.”  The duo, who started dating in May 2011, tied the knot in August 2015. While it was Theroux’s first marriage, Aniston was married to Pitt, 54, from 2000 to 2005. He infamously moved on from the Friends alum with his Mr. and Mrs. Smith costar, Angelina Jolie. Pitt and Jolie, who share Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11 and 9-year-old twins Knox and Vivienne, called it quits in September 2016 after two years of marriage and 12 years together.  “Jen has struggled with the perception that she is this pathetic woman after the divorce from Brad,” the insider tells Us. “It played a role in her wanting to marry Justin.”  For more on Aniston and Theroux’s split, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now!	0

"Mandy Moore knows how to celebrate!  The 34-year-old actress stops by The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Monday, where she tells all about her October trip to New Orleans, Louisiana. The vacay was a fun girls trip that also served as Moore's bachelorette getaway. Moore got engaged to her fiance, Taylor Goldsmith, last September after two years of dating.  ""I mean we called it just a girls trip, but my friends were lovely to like take off on a Wednesday to go to New Orleans with me,"" Moore tells DeGeneres of the trip. ""We're pretty tame. I mean, you know New Orleans people go and get pretty rowdy, but I think we were in bed by like 10 o'clock every night. We had a glass of wine and we're like, 'We're good. We're good.'""  Though they weren't going wild, New Orleans certainly had plenty of entertainment to offer the ladies.  ""It's the best,"" Moore exclaims of the city. ""The food, the culture, the architecture. We went on a ghost tour. We saw some jazz. We did all of it.""  At the time, Moore took to Instagram to thank her friends for making the trip with her.  ""Eternally grateful for the greatest girlfriends who are equal parts spontaneous and generous. They’re always game for an adventure and manage to prioritize our friendships in the face of the busy lives we all lead (like going on a trip in the middle of week cause why not??),"" Moore wrote.

So you want to learn about awards season, the never-ending footrace that annually dominates, terrorizes, and energizes the film industry. When does the season actually begin, and when does it end? What’s the purpose of all those film festivals in faraway locales? What goes into an Oscar campaign, and why, exactly, must Oscars be campaigned for in the first place? What makes the Oscars so all-encompassingly important for movies, anyway?  The answers you seek can be found below—starting with a definition of what we mean by “awards season” in the first place.  THE TIME FRAME  The truth is that for the movie industry, awards season never really ends. When one Oscar ceremony concludes, insiders immediately begin plotting for the next cycle—and so on and so forth. It’s like an election, except they prepare to run for president every year, instead of every four.  The more targeted answer is that awards season generally kicks off in September, and ends, of course, with the Oscars—i.e. the Academy Awards, presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, more commonly known as the Academy. The Oscars are usually held in late February or early March—though that will change in 2020.  WHY SEPTEMBER?  To make sure everyone in the Academy remembers your movie during the Oscar-voting window, of course. Feature-length films are eligible for Oscars if they screen theatrically between January 1 and December 31 of a given year. (So the Oscars held in 2019 actually honor the best films of 2018.) Nomination-round voting lasts for one week in January.  Given that, studios usually release their best movies in the fall, in order to ensure that voters won’t forget about them before voting begins. Many opt for a prime Thanksgiving or December 25 slot—which allows a movie to get holiday spending bucks and be the freshest film on an Academy member’s mind right before they vote. This timing explains why good movie options are so hard to find at the start of the new year, and why movies like Get Out, which was released in February 2017—an entire year before the Oscars for which it was eligible—are anomalies. It’s typically impossible for a film to maintain hype for an entire calendar year.  To get even more specific: awards season really, truly begins with the Toronto International Film Festival, which takes place in early September. That competition, with its convenient date and easy access for North American media and industry types, has become known as an event that separates awards wheat from the chaff. But more on that below.  THE FESTIVALS  These film competitions are where the biggest projects typically make their debut and vie for early attention. Here are some key fests to know:	1

"Sterling K. Brown and his wife, Ryan Michelle Bathe, first met at Stanford University.  Both of them are actors, and have even worked on This Is Us together.  The couple dated, but broke up for three-and-a-half years before reconnecting.  They were married in 2007, after being ""together solid since April 2004.""  Brown and Bathe have two sons together.  These days, Sterling K. Brown and Ryan Michelle Bathe are one of the cutest couples on every red carpet. During his acceptance speeches, Brown, who stars on NBC's hit drama This Is Us, has the sweetest things to say about Bathe. His wife is an actor herself, and has appeared in shows like Army Wives and Boston Legal. Though their marriage seems solid now, their relationship has had twists and turns that rival the drama played out on their respective TV shows. Here's exactly how the pair got together.  How Did Sterling K. Brown Meet His Wife?  Bathe and Brown first met while studying at Stanford University in 1998, where they lived in the same dorm and starred in plays together. Bathe recalled in an interview with People that she was wowed by his talent even then. ""I saw Sterling audition for Joe Turner's Come And Gone. We were both freshmen in college,"" she told the publication. ""I snuck in and I saw his audition, and I thought to myself, 'If this man can do this at 17 years old, my God. What could he do when he becomes a grown man?'""  Getty Images  They were friends first and bonded over their shared history. ""We found out that we were both from St. Louis. We didn't know that we were both from St. Louis, like, our parents went to rival high schools. We were born in the same hospital. Like, we were friends,"" Brown told Entertainment Tonight. ""She was dating somebody. Of course she was, she's gorgeous. So we were just buddies."" The relationship turned romantic, and they ended up dating on and off through college.  Why Did Sterling K. Brown and Ryan Michelle Bathe Break Up?  But it wasn't all romance from there. Bathe and Brown broke up for three and a half years before reconnecting. Brown said on The Talk that he had to work up a sweat to win her back. ""She was on a treadmill working out, and I had this epiphany. 'I have to go tell this woman she's the love of my life.' ... and she's like 'Well, I'm working out right now... I'm going to go on a run,'"" he told the hosts. ""She starts running through Koreatown, and I start running along with her. Brother had to work. But it was work well worthwhile.""  What Is Sterling K. Brown and Ryan Michelle Bathe's Marriage Like?  They were married in 2007, but their path to marriage was so dramatic, Brown thinks it would make a great movie. ""We need to actually put pen to paper and get it produced because people wouldn't believe it,"" he told ET. ""The multitude of ups and downs that we went through before we finally got together and figured it out. [We] have been together solid since April 2004, [but] all the stuff that happened before that, it's a good movie.""  The two have even acted together before. They both had roles on Army Wives, and Bathe was cast in a recurring role on This Is Us, too; she plays Yvette, the mother who confronts Rebecca about young Randall's hair and eventually befriends Jack and Rebecca. ""I love actors so much, I decided to marry one,"" Brown said during his acceptance speech at the 2018 SAG Awards. ""You're the best scene partner a brother's ever had.""  That said, though, they know one thing they can't do together, and that's rehearse. ""We've learned that there are certain minefields and pitfalls in our relationship, like a slalom, we just move right past them,"" Bathe told E! News. ""Rehearsing together is one of those things.""  Do Sterling K. Brown and Ryan Michelle Bathe Have Kids?  They have two sons together, Andrew, 6, and Amaré, 2. And Brown ended up having to help Bathe give birth to their oldest child, in a scene similar to the one Brown was in on This Is Us. ""My wife delivers quickly,"" Brown said on Live With Kel"	1

"It might've seemed like Affleck and Damon were overnight sensations when Good Will Hunting finally hit theaters in 1997, but the duo had to practice extreme patience to see the project through. As Affleck told Boston Magazine, the two initially got ahead of themselves when it came to their salaries from the script sell, saying, ""I remember it was printed in Daily Variety that we were going to get $600,000 on it. We had no credit, so we went to rent this house that was $3,000 a month, and we used a copy of the Daily Variety to get the place. I was like, 'I don't have credit, but this is who we are.' And the landlord was like, 'All right, sure.' We thought $600,000 would take care of us for 20 years, so we rented nicer apartments and each bought Jeep Cherokees. And we were completely broke in a year.""  It took several years for the film to finally reach a production stage due to rewrites and a crucial studio shift from Castle Rock to Miramax, during which time they even relocated back to Boston. But once their acting careers started taking flight — with Damon starring in the title role of The Rainmaker— and Robin Williams signed on for the film, the movie finally got into motion, and the two were finally on their way to the big time."	1

""Happy Valentine's Day Babe,"" a message written on a white card read.  The post came just a few hours after Kim expressed her undeniable love for her husband. ""I love you to infinity!"" she captioned a paparazzi picture of Kanye hugging her from behind. ""Happy Valentine's Day!!!""  It's certainly an exciting time for the West family, as they recently welcomed their third child, daughter Chicago ""Chi"" West, via surrogate. The two are also parents to daughter North, 4, and Saint, 1.  At the time of baby Chi's arrival, Kim announced the exciting news via her app.  ""We are incredibly grateful to our surrogate who made our dreams come true with the greatest gift one could give and to our wonderful doctors and nurses for their special care,"" she wrote on behalf of her and Kanye.

For a hundred years, movies have been a popular art form. So Wednesday morning, when the news came out that the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is proposing to introduce a new category at the Oscars, one that would be called best popular film (or words to that effect), the first reaction I had — apart from my jaw dropping on the floor in shock and dismay — was: best popular film? What does that even mean?  I get the motivation. The Academy, along with ABC, the TV network that programs the Oscars, is looking for new ways to lure viewers to a show that, in recent years, has seemed less and less interested in any film that could be called a blockbuster. That’s become a problem for the Oscars, as both a TV-ratings spectacle and a cultural event. There’s growing conviction, and with good evidence, that “the mass audience” — the people who turn out to see comic-book movies, “Star Wars” movies, etc. — is less and less interested in the Oscars. Ratings for the show have been in a slow but steady decline, and out of that reality grows the conviction — and fear — that the Oscars have become marginalized.  The problem is real. But let’s be clear: This category is not the way to fix it. The notion of putting “popular” films in a section all their own isn’t just unworkable — and, the more you look it, nonsensical. It’s nothing short of reprehensible. It violates the very spirit of what movies have been ever since there have been movies.  I ask again: What, exactly, is a “popular” film? “Avengers: Infinity War”? Undoubtedly. “Mission: Impossible — Fallout”? Most certainly. And what about “La La Land,” the musical that became a mainstream phenomenon by grossing $150 million? I’d say that counts too. So should “La La Land” have been nominated in the best popular film category? It’s not a comic-book movie, but it is a highly entertaining work of popular appeal made in a time-honored Hollywood genre.  Okay, it’s obvious that “La La Land” was trying to be a movie of genuine artistry. So should that, in fact, disqualify it from inclusion in the best popular film category? And if so, what do you do with “The Greatest Showman”? It wasn’t an acclaimed film like “La La Land” (though I gave it one of its rare rave reviews), but it, too, was a highly popular musical, grossing $175 million. Should that film have been nominated in the best popular film category? If so, should the category actually be called best popular film that critics don’t like?  But if that’s the case, what do you do with popcorn movies — big-ticket movies, blockbuster movies, popular movies — that critics adore? (Believe it or not, we actually give good reviews to more than a few of them.) As my colleague Kristopher Tapley has noted, there’s been much talk this year about the possibility of “Black Panther” receiving a best picture nomination, and maybe even winning. If that happened, it would be an event with meaning, a sign that the industry knows how to salute its organic diversity — and, just as much, that it could recognize that a comic-book film can achieve a heightened artistry. If the scenario of “Black Panther” dominating the Oscars came to pass, it would seem, to me, the essence of what the Oscars should be all about.  But let’s assume that we have a best popular film category. You’d think that “Black Panther,” since it’s the top-grossing movie of the year, would be relegated — almost by definition — to that category. Later on Wednesday, though, the Academy issued a clarifying statement that said a movie could be nominated in both the best popular film and best picture categories. That solves one problem by creating another. Imagine that “Black Panther” was nominated in both categories. Wouldn’t there be at least some Academy voters who felt tempted to vote for it in one category (i.e., best popular film) instead of the other? Wouldn’t the movie, in effect, be competing against itself?  Let’s be honest: The whole notion of a best popular film category feels chi	1
A subset of Walking Dead fans are taking to social media with threats to stop watching after the looming exit of leading man Andrew Lincoln, who will be departing the zombie drama after eight years as series protagonist Rick Grimes.  Word of Lincoln’s retirement from the long-running series broke Tuesday, with ComicBook.com exclusively revealing AMC is expected to officially announce Lincoln’s exit ahead of his final episodes in season 9.  According to reports, AMC aims to bump Daryl Dixon star Norman Reedus up to leading man status with a $20 million payday while Lincoln and Maggie Rhee actress Lauren Cohan are “phased out” with just a handful of episodes in the upcoming season 9.  The Walking Dead season 8 saw the show drop to its lowest ratings since its first season in 2010, bringing in just a 2.9 rating in adults 18—49 and 6.8 million viewers in Nielsen Live+Same Day numbers with episode 8x10, ‘The Lost and the Plunderers.’  That episode followed the mid-season premiere, ‘Honor,’ which controversially killed off longtime survivor Carl Grimes (Chandler Riggs).  With the upcoming exits of both Lincoln and Cohan — and the already significant losses of Riggs’ Carl and Lennie James’ Morgan, who made the leap to spinoff Fear The Walking Dead at the start of its fourth season — The Walking Dead risks losing even more viewership once two of its biggest stars are gone before the mid-season finale.	1
It was the least shocking news EVER: Nick Viall and Vanessa Grimaldi calling it quits! While the couple seemed picture perfect, for Bachelor Nation it was the break up we all saw coming. Here’s why:  Distance  Absence may make the heart grow fonder, but not when you barely know the person! Vanessa’s from Canada and Nick lives in Los Angeles and from the start of their relationship (they knew each other for only six weeks before getting engaged) Vanessa seemed pretty apprehensive about leaving her family to start a life with Nick in L.A. While she did make the move, leaving her job as a special education teacher, Vanessa was back-and-forth between Montreal and the L.A. which no doubt affected their relationship.  Their After The Final Rose Appearance  Who could forget the couple’s most cringe worthy TV moment? Immediately following the airing of their proposal Nick and Vanessa had one of the most awkward post-engagement moments EVER.  While they should have been in engagement bliss, Nick Viall and Vanessa Grimaldi did more talking about their relationship problems than they did about how in love they were.  “I’m not going to sugarcoat things” — please sugarcoat, please — “some days are tougher than others, like any relationship,” Vanessa admitted. “We’re very honest with each other — I don’t sweep anything under the rug, neither does he. … And it’s been hard. You know, we live in two different countries, [and we’re] starting a relationship where you don’t get the chance to see each other every day and do normal things. When we do see each other, it’s in a house. I love him, we love each other, but there are days that have been difficult.”  And just when you thought the difficult relationship talk was over, cue Nick’s chiming in about their “struggles.”  “There are days that have been difficult.” He also admitted, “I’m a realist, right?” Yes, Nick, you keep it real, but, can you give us a little love talk, please? “I think Vanessa and I continue to be that. As Vanessa mentioned, there’s been those moments,” he continued. “We’ve had our struggles, but we’re good communicators, and we talk. But we do try to be that team.”  Their Chemistry  While Nick and Vanessa made quite the good-looking couple they seemed to be missing that spark in their relationship.  Differing Career Paths  Nick seemed drawn to the spotlight while Vanessa looked like she hated all of the attention.  Dancing With The Stars  Almost immediately after The Bachelor wrapped Nick was onto his next show, Dancing With The Stars, which required him to spend HOURS away from his fiancé.  They’re Two COMPLETELY Different People  While on The Bachelor, Nick and Vanessa never seemed like they were on the same page.  They Met On Reality TV  Hello, they’re a bachelor couple. The barely knew each other before making one of the biggest commitments two people can make. #BachelorCurse  Wedding Date  Nick never seemed like he wanted to get married. The former software salesman even revealed to Us Weekly in July that wedding planning was still on hold. “Nothing has changed,” he said. “I think it’s always important to take things slow.”  Did you see Nick and Vanessa’s split coming?

There are thousands of religions in world that humans devote their whole lives to, but the one religion that almost everyone subscribes to? That would be coffee. Saturday, Sept. 29, is National Coffee Day, and in celebration of the most important day of the year, I’ve rounded up the best caffeine-infused beauty products from Birchbox to wake you up and keep you going. Ingesting coffee does one thing for your insides, but on your skin? That’s a whole other (wonderful) story.  “Coffee is useful in skincare because it’s rich in antioxidants that protect the skin, as well as caffeine to help the body get rid of excess fluid,” Dr. Joshua Zeichner, Director of Cosmetic and Clinical Research at Mount Sinai Hospital, tells Elite Daily. “Applying caffeine topically may improve the appearance of both cellulite and undereye puffiness, and by helping constrict blood vessels, it flushes away excess fluid that accumulates which makes the fat look more prominent,” he says.  Not only is coffee an anti-inflammatory, explains Zeichner, but it can help reduce redness, while antioxidants prevent skin damage from free radicals. “Topically applied, caffeine may help protect against some skin cancers at the molecular level,” he says.  Check out these Birchbox faves for caffeine-infused picks that won’t have you yawning. I promise.  Courtesy of Birchbox  ORIGINS GinZing™ Energy-Boosting Gel Moisturizer ($29.50, birchbox.com)  An oil-free moisturizer infused with panax-ginseng and coffee beans, the Origins GinZing gel will boost your skin’s radiance and hydration each morning. This pick is one of Origin’s best sellers and is light, but hydrating enough, for cooler fall temperatures.  Kiehl’s Eye Fuel ($22.50, birchbox.com)  Like food for your undereyes, the Kiehl’s Eye Fuel will hide all traces of a hangover or a restless night's sleep. The cooling cream contains caffeine and Vitamin B3 to instantly reduce puffiness and dark circles.  Courtesy of Birchbox  Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair Intensive Recovery Ampoules ($112, birchbox.com)  Don’t be fooled by their size—these ampoules are stronger than they appear. Each ampoule contains ChronoluxAI technology to help reduce visible irritation and soothe stressed out skin. Unlike other coffee-infused products that you slather on in the AM, Estee Lauder suggests applying this formula in the PM, after your serum and before your moisturizer.  Courtesy of Birchbox  Clarins Detox Booster ($39, birchbox.com)  This green juice for the skin helps bring your complexion back to life. Enriched with green coffee extract, a plant from tropical Africa and rich in caffeine, this booster should not be used alone—mix in 3-5 drops with your favorite moisturizer, serum or mask or foundation.  ARROW REVITALIZE Undereye Brightening Serum ($18, birchbox.com)  This undereye makeup pen not only conceals dark circles and puffiness, but the ginseng and caffeine-infused formula works to instantly soothe puffy bags. Bonus: the product comes in two shades, including light/medium and medium/deep.  Courtesy of Birchbox  JUARA Coffee & Creme Skin Smoothing Body Ritual ($58, birchbox.com)  Reinvigorate your body with this two-step skincare system, including a body scrub and body moisturizer. Infused with Indonesian coffee beans and candlenut oil, you’ll forget you’re actually in your shower and not the trendy coffee shop down the street.  Courtesy of Birchbox  100% Pure Organic Coffee Bean Caffeine Eye Cream ($26, birchbox.com)  Not only does this pick contain caffeine from coffee beans, but it also uses green tea to de-puff undereyes while increasing circulation. It’s formulated with natural and organic ingredients, like antioixdants and rosehip oil, for a gentle yet effective treatment.	1

But sources say there’s another huge reason for her wanting to lie low – problems with Brad Pitt, who friends have confirmed would be the father of her child.  It’s believed Brad and Jen – who rekindled their fairytale romance after Jen’s marriage to Justin Theroux ended earlier this year – have been on the rocks in recent weeks because of Brad’s controversial relationship with Neri Oxman.  Last month reports surfaced that Brad had been caught getting cosy with the beautiful young architect, leaving Jen feeling insecure and concerned about their relationship.  Added to this is the fact Jen’s also under immense pressure during her bitter divorce from Justin Theroux, from whom she split in February, and it’s a difficult time for the actress.  ‘She’s under a lot of stress at the moment, so... all these questions about a surprise pregnancy are the last thing she wants,’ adds the source.  ‘Not only is she going through a messy divorce, she’s having problems with Brad. Ever since his friendship with Neri went public, she’s been doubting their relationship and wondering whether he is serious about building a new life with her.  ‘Brad is desperately trying to convince Jen that they’re just friends and that he’s committed but Jen just isn’t buying it.  ‘She’s very wary of him – after all, it feels like only yesterday that he cheated on her with Angelina and destroyed their marriage.  ‘While Jen is hopeful that she and Brad will work things out, she’s also preparing herself for the fact that she may have to raise this baby alone. She has always said that she would be happy to be a single mother if that’s how everything worked out,’ reveals the insider.  After her split from Justin earlier, People magazine reported that having kids was always part of her plan during their marriage.  ‘She had been sad it never happened,’ a source told the magazine. ‘But it never consumed her.’  But since their separation, Jen has realised that her window for having a child is closing fast, making this baby buzz a beautiful surprise.  ‘This could be a dream come true for her, and she’s not going to let troubles with Brad ruin it. If she winds up alone, that’s absolutely fine with her. All she wants is a baby.’  Over the years, Jen has always dreamed of having a child, so the pregnancy is clearly everything to her.  In the past, she has lashed out at suggestions that she chose her Hollywood career over becoming a mum: ‘This continually is said about me: that I was so career-driven and focused on myself; that I don’t want to be a mother and how selfish that is,’ she told Allure.  Denying that was the case, she said: ‘No. Even saying it gets me a little tight in my throat.’  For the full story, and to see more exclusive pictures of Jen's baby bump, see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!	0

While many celebrity couples like to keep their relationships private, Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes give a whole new meaning to that as they have tried to keep their romance a secret for years. In 2017 though, the pair were photographed together walking hand in hand along a beach in Malibu, California, and everyone thought then that they were going to be more public with their relationship. But as it turns out, they still don’t want to talk about it.  Here’s what we know about the ultra-private couple and why they still refuse to speak publicly about each other.  Foxx and Holmes have never confirmed relationship  Left: Jamie Foxx in 2018 | Greg Doherty/Getty Images, Right: Katie Holmes in New York City | Monica Schipper/Getty Images Left: Jamie Foxx in 2018 | Greg Doherty/Getty Images, Right: Katie Holmes in New York City | Monica Schipper/Getty Images  Even though the cat is out of the bag, Foxx and Holmes have never actually confirmed their relationship. In fact, they did the opposite and denied it on many occasions by pulling the old “just friends” line.  So, despite their Labor Day PDA photo, or picture of them grabbing dinner in NYC, or gazing into one another’s eyes at a pre-Grammy event, we shouldn’t expect these two to suddenly do red carpets together anytime soon.  Next: Have they kept quiet because of Tom Cruise?    Did they stay silent because of a Tom Cruise ban?  Is Tom Cruise influencing Katie Holmes, and Jamie Foxx’s relationship? | Win McNamee/Getty Images Is Tom Cruise influencing Katie Holmes, and Jamie Foxx’s relationship? | Win McNamee/Getty Images  Foxx and Holmes initially sparked dating rumors back in 2013, but up until 2012 the actress was married to Tom Cruise. One report claimed that as part of their divorce settlement, Holmes had to keep any new relationship under wraps for five years so Cruise wouldn’t be embarrassed.  That five-year mark was up in 2017 when the Malibu photo surfaced, but Gossip Cop debunked the allegation of a ban put in place by the Mission Impossible calling it “fiction.” Moreover, if Holmes and Foxx only kept quiet over the years because of some ban, then why wouldn’t they be more public now?  Next: They spend time together out of the spotlight.    The couple spends most of their time together at home  Katie Holmes has gone through extra measures to keep this relationship as private as possible. | Christopher Polk/Getty Images for NARAS Katie Holmes has gone through extra measures to keep this relationship as private as possible. | Christopher Polk/Getty Images for NARAS  With only of few photos of them out and about, the couple has gone to great lengths to remain under the radar and one way they do that is by spending time together at home.  An insider told People that on date nights they hang out at their houses in Los Angeles saying, “They only spend time together at each other’s homes” to avoid the paparazzi.  Next: Foxx isn’t talking.    Foxx ends interview after being asked about Holmes  He was not interested in answering that question. | Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images He was not interested in answering that question. | Robyn Beck/AFP/Getty Images  During NBA All-Star weekend in February 2018, the Oscar winner showed everyone that he doesn’t appreciate being asked about his lady by abruptly ending an interview when a journalist went there.  Referring to some pictures that were published a day earlier, ESPN’s Michael Smith asked, “Did you and Katie Holmes play basketball for Valentine’s Day?” Foxx responded by saying nothing at all and simply removed his microphone and walked away, proving that if you want to talk to him, don’t bring up Holmes.

Until now, seeing Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes out together as a couple was as common as a Bigfoot sighting or riding a unicorn ... but not anymore!!!  It took 4 years, but Hollywood's most top secret couple finally packed on the PDA Monday in Malibu ... hand in hand in the sand. Though they've allegedly been together since 2013 -- about a year after her split from Tom Cruise -- this is the first time they've been seen doing what lovebirds do.  As we reported ... Katie was seen with a ring on her finger in March 2016, but Foxx's rep said it wasn't from him. A year before that, Jamie denied they were even a thing. Still, the relationship was no secret to most in Hollywood -- JamKat just never let on in public.  JamKat? Can we slap a ™ on that ... just in case?	0
Can we just change #MCM to mean #MomCrushMonday? All in favor? After all, motherhood isn’t a solo sport. It definitely requires a tribe — for inspiration’s and sanity’s sake. And Mom star Anna Faris says she’s found that tribe in fellow mamas Kristen Bell and Reese Witherspoon.  More: Kristen Bell Gets Why Chris Pratt & Anna Faris Split  “I like how they combine humor with raising kids, but also how they tackle motherhood and work without being pretentious,” Faris told Us Weekly. “The first few years, I was like, ‘Oh, my God. Everyone else seems to know exactly what to do and I don’t.’”  Faris said she’s grateful for Witherspoon and Bell’s keep-it-real parenting style and their willingness to be candid about their mistakes. Faris admits she’s still figuring things out. “I question every single thing, like, ‘Oh, I shouldn’t have changed lanes,’ or ‘Why don’t I have hand sanitizer?’ and ‘I should have applied more sunblock,’” she told the magazine. “There’s just so much pressure for parents and it’s tough to let yourself off the hook and be like, ‘You know what? He’s happy. It’s OK.”  Faris and ex-husband (*sob*) Chris Pratt share son Jack, who’s now 5. Fans were devastated by news of the divorce, but by all accounts, Faris and Pratt remain friends and are committed to co-parenting their son in peace. Faris told Extra recently that she and Pratt believe co-parenting is “hugely important.”  “We are great and there’s so much friendship and love, and we surround Jack with love, and funny, kind, happy people, and as a result, he is really happy,” she said. Sounds like Faris — who’s recently thrown herself into her podcast, Unqualified — is doing great and doesn’t need all that help from Bell and Witherspoon at all. Still, we’re glad she’s got a support system in place for those mom days when it feels like there’s not enough pizza — or merlot — in the world.  More: Anna Faris & New Beau Are Already Vacationing Together  Faris rarely posts personal pics of her son on Instagram — in fact, the last time she did was September 2015 in this adorable on-the-way-to-the-airport shot.  She admits that things are easier now that Jack is 5. She told Us, “I just get such a kick out of him now. He does weird things. The other day we were at a restaurant and he ate five balls of butter just by himself. My friends were a little bit horrified… but it was just one of those funny things where I was thinking, That’s my kid! He’s hysterical!”  Well, with a funny mom like Faris, it’s no wonder Jack’s already ramping up the humor. Anna, you’d make our #MomCrushMonday list any day.	0

Angelina Jolie demanding her estranged husband Brad Pitt dump Jennifer Aniston in order to continue seeing his six children is nothing but a bogus claim by a news outlet. The absurd claim made by NW was recently debunked by Gossip Cop.  Brad Pitt, Jennifer Aniston, And Angelina Jolie’s Private Lives  In September 2016, the entertainment world woke with the news of Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie parting ways for good. Prior to the release of their official statement, there were rumors that due to Brad’s closeness with Marion Cotillard, Angelina Jolie decided to end her two-year marriage with Pitt. However, that was not the case and Marion herself debunked the false claims.  Over the next few months, there were several reports suggesting Brad was moving on with Sienna Miller and other known Hollywood actresses. Not only this, there were absurd claims by many known media publications that even Angelina Jolie was getting married for the fourth time. Despite all the speculation, Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie remained single.  Ever since Jennifer Aniston announced her separation with Justin Theroux, many speculated that Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston will rejoin as a couple. There was a recent claim that suggested Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston are reuniting as business partners. However, like always, these claims were later debunked.  Featured image credit: Jonathan Leibson Getty Images for Audi  Earlier this week, NW falsely claimed that Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston secretly got married in Paris. On the magazine’s cover, NW used an old picture of Brad and Angelina, in which the actress’s head is swapped with Jennifer’s. The new photoshopped image allegedly looked like Brad was kissing Jen.  Loading...  “It’s Jen or the kids.”  According to an accompanying article, Angelina Jolie is not at all happy with Brad’s happiness and cannot stand that her six children would be around Jennifer and be calling her stepmom.  “Brad’s assured Jen he’s not taking Ange’s ultimatum seriously. There’s no way a judge would give in to her demands,” asserted the source.  Gossip Cop has debunked all these claims and reported that there is nothing going on between Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston. The former couple got in touch very casually and occasionally. There has not actually been any confirmation on a Brad-Jen reunion as a couple. Despite all the bogus reports, the only factual accuracy is that Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are still working on their divorce settlement, which includes the future of their six children.	0
"Kim Kardashian and Kanye West are putting in a pool, according to TMZ, which says it obtained copies of building permits for the in-progress pool at the couple's Hidden Hills estate. Aerial photos published by TMZ indicate the pool—reportedly clocking in at 20-by-60 feet—is already well in development, although it's unclear when it will be complete. TMZ also reported that the Wests spent another $12,000 on building a new guard shack. Whether this is specifically to deter would-be skinny-dippers, or if it's just another add-on to their already tight security team, is unclear.  There's no word on who designed the pool, but it would not be surprising if it turned out to be Kanye West himself. In May, the multihyphenate added another hyphen when he announced he was starting a new architecture firm called Yeezy Home. ""We’re looking for architects and industrial designers who want to make the world better,"" he wrote on Twitter. As Architectural Digest reported, this wasn't just a ploy to expand his résumé—he worked with Axel Vervoordt on the Hidden Hills home, sharing photos of its Zen Brutalist aesthetic on Twitter.  It would also not be surprising if West got pretty hands-on in the construction of his new pool. In a previous interview with Architectural Digest, Kim Kardashian West revealed that her husband is quite the builder. ""My husband makes all of his own furniture in his office,"" she said. ""My office is all Vincent Van Duysen, but Kanye is so good at it, he loves to draw out pieces. Axel made a couch in our house called the 'Kanye couch' because Kanye designed it with him."""	0

Despite being just 20 years old, Kylie Jenner has been the subject of much speculation about whether or not she’s had plastic surgery. At last count, it’s been five years since the world became obsessed with Kylie’s lips. Some of her fans even tried using a lip-enhancing tool to get a Jenner-sized pout. (Spoiler: the #KylieJennerLipChallenge did not end well.) For a long time, the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star denied getting injections, instead claiming that she had been over lining her lips. However, she recently came clean about the lip fillers, explaining that she’s been having them done for five years. This got us thinking: What else has Kylie had done that she hasn’t told us about? Here, plastic surgeon Dr Andrea Giannitrapani from MYA gives his professional opinion on the procedures Kylie Jenner miiiight have had done.  Lips  So, Kylie’s lips are no longer a mystery: She’s definitely had them done. On a recent episode of Life of Kylie, she opened up about why she got them done:  “I was 15 and I was insecure about my lips. I have really small lips. And it was like one of my first kisses and a guy was like, ‘I didn’t think you would be a good kisser because you have such small lips.’ I took that really hard. When a guy you like says that, I don’t know, it just really affected me. I just didn’t feel desirable or pretty. “I would overline my lips with the lip liner to create the illusion of bigger lips and then, finally, I was like, this lip liner isn't doing it and ended up getting my lips done.”  Breasts  In 2015, Kylie posted on her app, telling her fans that the secret to her new, bigger boobs was a Victoria’s Secret bra. “Everyone thinks I’ve gotten a breast augmentation recently and I haven’t.” She adds, “I just use the ‘Bombsh ell’ by Victoria’s Secret – it’s life-changing. I’ve gotten all my sisters on it, all my friends and if you ever want the look of bigger breasts, that’s what I do.”  Referring to the above images, Dr Giannitrapani thinks that Kylie has probably had breast augmentation. “There is a clear size increase to Kylie’s breasts looking at the side profile of these comparison pictures,” he said. “Although they are not out of proportion with her frame, they have the characteristics of a breast enlargement in the early stages of healing and look as though they still need time to settle.” “If she intended on keeping the procedure a secret, the surgeon will have gone for an implant size to suit her frame and for the result to look as natural as possible whilst still creating the volume increase she desired.”  Curves	0
Is she or isn’t she preggers (Picture: Splash News)  Usually, the first to show off her body, Khloe Kardashian has been spotted out and about with her sisters without her trademark skin-tight clothing, sparking some more pregnancy rumours.  The 33-year-old, who is reported to be ‘four months pregnant’, according to TMZ, joined sisters Kim and Kourtney in San Francisco where they are filming for Keeping Up With The Kardashians.  Khloe, who is dating Tristan Thompson, walked beside her older sisters in an oversized coat and baggy clothes on Saturday.  If she is with child, any hint of a bump was well-hidden, apart from a slight curve that could be seen underneath her jeans as she walked.  A rumoured pregnant Khloe Kardashian walks solo in the San Francisco (Picture: Splash News)  Keeping her alleged baby bump hidden, we can’t help but feel taunted with all the pregnancy suggestions, with no actual confirmation.  Advertisement  Advertisement  The sisters, who usually dress in coordinated outfits, looked like a far cry from their usual uniform as Kim and Kourtney flaunted their flat tummies too.  Khloe has so far refused to confirm or deny whether the reports of her pregnancy are true.  Kim and Khloe enjoying the sun (Picture: Backgrid)  Appearing at an event last weekend, Khloe commented on her curvier size and added according to People: ‘When I was bigger and wore bigger clothes, I looked even bigger. I love embracing my curves no matter what size I am.’  Khloe covers her body completely sparking more rumours (Picture: Splash News)  If the rumours are true, Khloe and her NBA star boyfriend, who have dated for one year, will be expecting their first child together.  Fans are clearly eager to know what’s going on, as they have been flooding Khloe’s Instagram every time she posts a picture, convinced they can see a ‘baby bump’  Khloe is reportedly pregnant with Tristan Thompson’s child (Picture: Splash News)  The family’s radio silence suggest there will be a big announcement (Picture: Splash News)  The Instagram picture showed Khloe in a revealing leather black dress and among the comments praising Khloe for her look were many who believed the picture showed a hint of baby bump.  ‘Aw look at her little baby bump! (sic),’ wrote one fan while another asked: ‘Is that baby bump or I’m just trippin?’ Another thought for sure that they could ‘see that bump’.  Advertisement  Advertisement  It was suggested that the uncharacteristic radio silence from the family suggests that there may be plans in the works for some kind of headline-stealing joint pregnancy reveal from the sisters; sister Kim has already confirmed she is expecting her third child, via a surrogate, in a teaser clip for the upcoming 14th season of their hit show Keeping Up With The Kardashians.  Kim and Khloe’s younger half-sister Kylie Jenner is also reportedly pregnant, due in January with boyfriend Travis Scott’s baby.  Kim (L) is expecting her third child via a surrogate pregnancy (Picture: Backgrid)  Although Kylie is keeping mum, it has also been claimed that the 20-year-old has hired a whole squad ahead of her rumoured child’s arrival, including a pregnancy coach to help her make sure she’s eating right and staying healthy, but also a whole new team to help expand her empire.  The Kardashian could soon be expanding (Picture: BACKGRID)  This is in addition to extra security, according to Radar Online. ‘Kylie hired a pregnancy coach too, who will help her with nutrition and exercise, as well as take her through Lamaze training when she gets further along,’ an insider said.  ‘Kylie is definitely not taking any chances when it comes to her unborn baby!’  MORE: The Kardashian baby boom: Everything you need to know about the Kim, Kylie and Khloe rumours  MORE: Kylie Jenner needs to stop taunting the heck out of us with these ‘pregnancy’ pictures	0
"Watch Jimmy Fallon Hilariously Cover Journey, Get Heckled By Will Ferrell Written By Mick Joest  Random Article Blend Will Ferrell appeared on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon ahead of him hosting Saturday Night Live, and while sketches are usually SNL's forte, the two former castmates had to get together for a great bit on the late-night talk show. Fallon hilariously covered Journey's ""Don't Stop Believin,"" while Will Ferrell heckled him in a skit that could've been reserved for Saturday Night Live: Facebook        Copy to clipboard It was a bold move to have Jimmy Fallon, the master of unintentional laughing, play a stone-faced dead-pan singer while someone as funny as Will Ferrell shouted things at him. The host surprisingly maintained his composure and didn't break character until Ferrell stormed the stage with a ""Streetlights,"" and ""People,"" chant. Overall the skit was a hit. Although the costume choice The Tonight Show went with for both actors was rather confusing, until it was revealed at the end of the sketch Fallon's character sold the song to Journey. Speaking of that end text, yes, StreetlightswithGabriel.com is a real website. The website for the fictional sports bar contains a submission section for inquiries, and a menu that has everything from ""Bite-Sized Boneless Blue Cheese Buffalo Wings,"" to ""Popsicles."" The specialty drink menu contains some interesting items as well, as patrons can purchase drinks like the ""1952 Macallan Ice Luge,"" and the ""Surfer On Acid,"" slushie. There are even some reviews from people who have been to the establishment, and their words about the bar fit the description it was given on The Tonight Show: This is the definition of a watering hole. Dimly lit, frankly a bit hard to see the drink in front of you. For some reason, they have only the 'Lite' version of beers. But, all in all, all of these features lead to an effective dive bar feel, and make you wanna order more of those yum-tastic chicken wings. -CAPITAL CITY DAILY, December 14, 2007 It's a fair amount of work to put into such a short but funny sketch on The Tonight Show, but totally worth it. It's not the only time a website has been created for a Will Ferrell related bit, as the actor later shared with Fallon the same thing was done for his fictional character that hosted the Rose Parade on Amazon. Ferrell also brought up another recent stunt he pulled at the Australian Open, and informed the audience that tennis legend Roger Federer had no idea Ferrell was going to interview him after the match. That's probably for the best, as there's a good chance Federer would've shot the idea down if he knew he was going to be asked if he was a vampire just minutes after a match. The Tonight Show airs weeknights on NBC at 11:35 p.m. ET. Will Ferrell will attempt to keep his current funny streak at live events alive as he hosts Saturday Night Live on NBC Saturday, January 27 at 11:30 p.m. ET. For more on SNL and late-night talk shows, be sure to listen to Leslie Jones recall on Late Night With Seth Meyers the time she almost vomited all over James Franco live during a sketch last year.

"EXCLUSIVE  4:15 PM PT -- The graffiti has been completely removed.  3:55 PM PT -- Trump's star has been vandalized AGAIN, and this time it's a bloody mess. Someone poured paint -- or something that looks like fake blood -- all over the President's plaque on the Walk of Fame.  Play video content TMZ.com  As we told you, we have a fixed camera across the street, and it captured footage of the culprit in action. The man appears to have been part of a PETA protest going down outside a retail store next to the star.  It didn't take long this time around for someone to start cleaning it up. It appears the swastikas from Wednesday morning had just been scrubbed before this latest incident.  Play video content 12/20/18 TMZ.com  Some guy vandalized Donald Trump's star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame with swastikas ... and we got him on camera doing it.  TMZ captured the crime in progress through our live stream feed on Hollywood Blvd., and you can see a man dressed in black bend down and scribble all over Trump's star. Mind you, this was done Wednesday morning around 9 AM PT ... in broad daylight.  You can see, it's already starting to fade.  The culprit does the deed quickly as people walk right by him without batting an eyelash, but two women seem to notice the tagging as he walks away. There appears to be a written message, too, using a Spanish language slur -- ""F*** This P**o"" -- and the 2 big swastikas are underneath the words.  We're told no one filed a police report about the vandalism. Of course, this is just the latest hit job the President's star has received over the past couple years.  Most recently, someone drew prison bars over the star (which we also caught on camera) ... and then there was the second pickax incident earlier this summer."	1
"Taylor Swift dropped another catchy bop from her upcoming album, Reputation, last night. It's called ""Gorgeous,"" and the beginning of the song starts out with a baby—like, an actual baby—cooing the word gorgeous. Swift teased this detail about the track hours before she released it, but that's not stopping fans from obsessing to the max. Why did she make this call? And, more important, who the hell is the baby?  Twitter might have the answer to that second question. The dominant fan theory with Swifties on social media right now is that Blake Lively and Ryan Reynolds' daughter, James, is the one saying ""gorgeous.""  ""It is rumoured that the child’s voice at the start of Taylor’s Swift’s new song, #Gorgeous is Blake and Ryan’s daughter James,"" a tweet from a Lively news Twitter handle reads. See it for yourself, below:  And then there's this message from Swift herself on Tumblr. When a fan asked her the identity of the mystery baby, she said, ""300 people know,"" referring to the fans who've heard the album ahead of time during her Reputation secret sessions. A mysterious answer like this must mean something juicy, right?  It'd make total sense if baby James was the one behind ""Gorgeous."" After all, Swift is really good friends with both Reynolds and Lively. She even paid the couple a visit to the hospital after Lively gave birth to her second child. The three of them, along with Swift's boyfriend Joe Alwyn, reportedly spent a weekend together in July at Swift's spacious Rhode Island pad. Maybe that's where Swift pitched this idea to Lively and Reynolds in the first place?  If this is true, baby James is definitely a contender for the Best Baby Feature Grammy Award I just made up.

Do we hear ‘Jelena’ wedding bells? Are Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber finally tying the knot? Well, it seems like they are!  Selena recently broke up with The Weeknd and rekindled her relationship with ex-boyfriend, Justin Bieber. She ended a nine months relationship with the ‘Starboy’ singer.  Selena and Justin are having the time of their lives and it’s only perfect to say that the wedding rumors might just be true.  OK!

REAL NEWS. REAL VOICES Help us tell more of the stories that matter from voices that too often remain unheard. Support Journal Post  The tabloid also mentioned a few places the couple is considering for their wedding ceremony. The venues include, “Mexico, Hawaii, or the luxurious Sandy Lane hotel in Barbados.”  The former Disney star has been going through a lot of ups and downs with her family. As per the reports, Selena does not have a healthy relationship with her mother.  The 25-year-old American popstar and her mother, Mandy Teefay, had a serious rift in 2014. Selena dismissed her mom from the official managerial role and the relationship became even more complicated when Selena’s family expressed their disapproval of Justin Bieber.  Mandy even ended up in the hospital a few weeks ago following a heated argument her celebrity daughter.  OK! Australia further disclosed:  “Since both Justin and Selena want the wedding to be drama-free, without any protests or interventions, they’ve decided to marry in secret.”  However, the news of the couple getting married has been dismissed by Gossip Cop. They stated that the narrative was made up and completely untrue.  The website claimed that if the marriage is supposed to be a secret, why an insider would reveal the news to a tabloid company.  Gossip Cop said that Selena Gomez is presently celebrating New Year with her friends in Mexico without Justin Bieber. The website additionally confirmed that the ‘Fetish’ star will not marry Justin in secret without the blessing of her family.  On the other hand, it looks like Justin Bieber is open to the idea of wedding his girlfriend in the future. When ‘Hollywood Fix’ asked Justin Bieber about his plans to propose Selena, he only blushed at the question and said nothing.  Well, his cheeks said it all and the fans loved every bit of it!  The two have been going on cute dates after the reignition of their love affair.  Well, even if a wedding is not around the corner, we are absolutely cheering the ‘Jelena’ comeback!	0

Nominations for the 2018 Tony Awards were announced Tuesday morning — and they gave Broadway plenty to chatter about. With a roster of candidates that includes “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” “Mean Girls” and “Frozen,” these are the Tony nominations’ biggest snubs and surprises:  SURPRISE: Amy Schumer, “Meteor Shower”  The Steve Martin comedy “Meteor Shower” was one of the season’s giant hits, thanks to Schumer’s name on the marquee. But after the show earned very mixed reviews, no one expected Tony nominators to remember it particularly favorably, and even if they did, a nomination seemed most likely to have gone to Tony favorite Laura Benanti. Still, Schumer’s performance impressed nominators enough that now she’ll add an extra jolt of star power to the ceremony, where she’s up against acting royalty Glenda Jackson, among others, in the race for lead actress in a play.  SNUB: Chris Evans, “Lobby Hero”  The “Avengers: Infinity War” actor has surprised a lot of Broadway audiences with his turn in “Lobby Hero,” in which he plays, very convincingly, a deeply unlikable cop who’s a far cry from Captain America. But with shows like “Angels in America” and “The Iceman Cometh” also in the mix, the field of male actors was particularly packed this season, and while nominators found room for “Lobby Hero” cast members Brian Tyree Henry and Michael Cera, Evans was left out.  SURPRISE: Michael Cera, “Lobby Hero”  Playing a slacker doorman in “Lobby Hero,” Michael Cera gives a performance that’s so on-brand for the actor and so seemingly effortless that theatergoers have dismissed his work in what some might not notice is the play’s linchpin role. But Tony nominators didn’t make that mistake, giving Cera a nod for his skilled, subtle work.  SNUB: “Frozen”  Sure, Disney’s incipient hit earned a trio of big award noms, placing in the races for new musical, book of a musical (Jennifer Lee) and score (Kristen Anderson-Lopez and Robert Lopez). But that’s the only recognition the production got from nominators, who overlooked notable contributors like director Michael Grandage, as well as the well-received lead performances from Caissie Levy and Patti Murin. (The silver lining: “Frozen” doesn’t need Tony Awards to run forever, anyway.)  SURPRISE: “Angels in America” breaks a record  If we were going to pick one show from this season that seemed most likely to hit a new high for total nominations earned by a play, we would have gone with sweeping two-part epic “Harry Potter and the Cursed Child,” the frontrunner in the new play category. But while “Potter” emerged with a plenty impressive haul of 10 noms, it was another sweeping two-parter, “Angels in America,” that set a new record with 11 nods for play revival, including director (Marianne Elliott) and actors Andrew Garfield and Nathan Lane, plus design awards. One of the most notable nods: A nomination in the category for original score (Adrian Sutton), where the play’s music will compete with songs for musicals like “The Band’s Visit” and “Mean Girls.”  SNUB: Americans  This Tony season’s big trend on the red carpet: English accents. With so many new plays and play revivals transferring to Broadway from the U.K. — including notable candidates like “Cursed Child” and “Angels” — Brits dominate the nonmusical categories. For instance, three of the five new play nominees come from U.K. writers and performers, and in the lead actor in a play race, there’s only one American, Denzel Washington (“The Iceman Cometh”), up against Andrew Garfield (“Angels in America”), Tom Hollander (“Travesties”), Jamie Parker (“Harry Potter”) and Mark Rylance (“Farinelli and the King”). (Or maybe it’s 1.5 Americans in the category: Garfield was born in California and has dual citizenship.)

    Charlize Theron will be in Bachelor withdrawal this coming Monday.  “I basically feel like I’m dating The Bachelor, like, the show,” she revealed during a Thursday, March 8, appearance on The Late Late Show. The 42-year-old even has a special ritual that involves tricking her children Jackson, 6, and August, 2, into early lights out.  “On Monday nights because my kids can’t read a clock yet,” Theron told host James Corden. “I get them to bed at like 5:45 and then I open a bottle of wine, take a bath. I get all ready and that’s my date night. I date the show.”  When Corden, 39, inquired about who the Oscar winner would like to receive a rose from, she replied: “No, I don’t want to be on the show. I just want to watch.”  Meanwhile, Theron will have to find a new “boyfriend.” The season finale of The Bachelor aired on Monday, March 5!  The Bachelor wasn’t the only thing Theron got candid about. Theron was joined on Corden’s stage with Gringo costar David Oyelowo and she shared a hilarious memory about how they first bonded while filming in Mexico City. According to the actress, she and Oyelowo, 41, were at a restaurant and he began telling a funny story.  “I kept saying, ‘You have to stop,’ and he wouldn’t stop,” she recalled. “He kept going with the story until I actually urinated myself. Not drizzle, I had to go back to the hotel, that’s how hard he made me laugh.”  Oyelowo didn’t realize what was happening. “She ran out,” he quipped. “And I looked at the chair.”  For all the latest Bachelor news subscribe to our new podcast ‘Watch With Us’ below!    	0
"Gwyneth Paltrow is receiving backlash for a recent Goop article about ""achieving your leanest livable weight.""  The article drew criticism for appearing to equate health with thinness.  One Twitter user thought the article was promoting ""how to be as thin as possible without dying.""    There's no question that the wellness advice Gwyneth Paltrow preaches on her website Goop are controversial. But for many readers, the website's recent article on how to obtain ""your leanest livable weight"" is taking controversy to a new level.  The 45-year-old actress and her lifestyle brand are under fire for promoting severe weight loss and teaching people ""how to be as thin as possible without dying,"" according to one critic. Last week, Goop published an article titled ""Busting Diet Myths."" The article was promoted on its Twitter with the caption, ""Why diets don't work, the role of willpower, and achieving your leanest livable weight.""  Immediately, Paltrow and her website were slammed for advocating thinness and encouraging unhealthy weight loss. According to the article, a person's ""‘leanest livable weight' is the weight at the low end of [one's] ‘set range.' Your set range is a genetically determined range of weight that your body generally keeps you in.""  Critics took fault with the term leanest livable weight, which many believed translated into Goop encouraging its readers to slim down to the lowest weight they can maintain while still living.  Though we can understand Goop's intention of giving advice on how to diet healthily, equating thinness with health is not the way to go. We agree with the internet on this one.  "	1
"Natalie Maines files for divorce after 17 years  Natalie Maines has filed for divorce from her husband, actor Adrian Pasdar, USA TODAY has confirmed.  The Dixie Chicks singer, 42, shares two sons, Jackson Slade, 16, and Beckett Finn,13, with Pasdar, 52.  ""It's a private family matter,"" Maines' rep, Cindi Berger, tells USA TODAY.

"Royal baby: Prince William and Duchess Kate's new prince is named Louis Arthur Charles  LONDON — Four days after the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's new royal baby was born, the public learned Friday that the little prince will be called Louis Arthur Charles.  Kensington Palace said the baby, the couple's second son, will be known as His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge.  Prince Louis, born at St. Mary's Hospital in London at one minute after 11 a.m. local time on Monday, weighed 8 pounds, 7 ounces at birth.  Louis (pronounced ""Louie"") is one of Prince William's several middle names and was also given to his other son, Prince George, as a middle name.  Arthur, which had been the favorite name among British bettors, was the middle name of great-granny Queen Elizabeth II's father, King George VI, as well as that carried by King Arthur of Britain's mythic past.  The name Louis is more closely associated with French monarchs, such as Louis XIV, the Sun King. In British royal terms, the name can be seen as a touching honor to the baby's great-grandfather, Prince Philip, 96, and a posthumous honor to Lord Louis ""Uncle Dickie"" Mountbatten, a royal relation (like them, descended from Queen Victoria) and Philip's uncle.  As a young orphaned Greek royal exile, Philip was raised by Mountbatten and was introduced to the then-Princess Elizabeth as a teen through the ambitious matchmaking of Uncle Dickie.  Mountbatten was especially close to the baby's grandfather, Prince Charles, who viewed him as a mentor and father figure. A former British Navy leader and the last British viceroy of India, Mountbatten was killed by an IRA bomb at age 79 (along with some of his family) while fishing off his Irish estate in 1979, a shocking tragedy that devastated the royal family.  The baby is the couple's third child and is the first little prince to be affected by a 2013 change in British laws that made birth order more important than gender in determining the line of succession to the throne.  Thus, this baby is fifth in line, behind his older sister instead of displacing her.  Uncle Prince Harry, 33, moved down to sixth in line, and any children he has with his American fiancée, Meghan Markle, 36, will follow him in the succession.  Will and Kate's other recent name choices — Prince George Alexander Louis, 4, and Princess Charlotte Elizabeth Diana, 2 — come from the 18th and 19th centuries, balancing tradition, family obligations and personal taste.  More: Duchess Kate and Prince William leave hospital with new baby prince  More: How does Duchess Kate do it? From giving birth to camera-ready in heels in under 8 hours  Christian Turner, global director of naming at the brand-strategy firm Siegel+Gale, says that in naming their children, Will and Kate have skillfully navigated the tricky shoals of meeting history's expectations while sending branding signals to the public that ""we're like you, we're a family.""  He says George and Charlotte are examples of historical names that also have become popular in recent decades with everyone else. ""The royals are trying to connect with the people; they're putting in the hours trying to make sure they're royal in bearing and stature but also familiar and accessible to everyone,"" Turner says.  Will and Kate took two days to announce both George and Charlotte's names.  The young royal family emerged from the hospital six hours after the delivery Monday, baby in Kate's arms, as cheers from a small crowd of onlookers erupted and the cameras of the usual huge media mob whirred and clicked.  Kate was wearing a Jenny Packham knee-length red dress with a white Peter Pan collar, and showed only a slight remaining baby bump. Later, they went back inside briefly, then reemerged holding hands, with Will carrying the baby in a baby car seat. Then they returned to their Kensington Palace apartment as news helicopters followed them from above.  Prince William was there for the birth, as he was for their previous two chi"	1

"The Versace family has been in a war of words with FX and Ryan Murphy over the upcoming show, The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story. On Monday, the family released a statement calling the show “a work of fiction,” created without their approval. Now, they have gone even further, calling the show’s source material inaccurate.  The show was based on the book , a best-seller by Maureen Orth. FX released a statement saying they “stand by the meticulous reporting of Ms. Orth,” and Murphy said the book “has been vetted for almost two decades.”  A new statement released Wednesday shows that things are still contentious between the family and the show’s creators. The statement calls the book “full of gossip and speculation” and “full of contradictions.” The statement also refers to the show’s portrayal of a “medical condition,” and Entertainment Weekly reports that they are referring to Orth’s reporting that Versace was HIV-positive at the time of his death; that claim is reportedly depicted in the show, but the Versace family says her reporting “ignores contrary information” they provided.  Read the statement in full below:  “As we have said, the Versace family has neither authorized nor had any involvement whatsoever in the forthcoming TV series about the death of Mr. Gianni Versace, which should only be considered as a work of fiction. The company producing the series claims it is relying on a book by Maureen Orth, but the Orth book itself is full of gossip and speculation. Orth never received any information from the Versace family and she has no basis to make claims about the intimate personal life of Gianni Versace or other family members. Instead, in her effort to create a sensational story, she presents second-hand hearsay that is full of contradictions.    ""As just one example, Orth makes assertions about Gianni Versace’s medical condition based on a person who claims he reviewed a post-mortem test result, but she admits it would have been illegal for the person to have reviewed the report in the first place (if it existed at all). In making her lurid claims, she ignores contrary information provided by members of Mr. Versace’s family, who lived and worked closely with him and were in the best position to know the facts of his life.    ""Gianni Versace was a brave and honest man, who engaged in humanitarian work for the benefit of others. Of all the possible portrayals of his life and legacy, it is sad and reprehensible that the producers have chosen to present the distorted and bogus version created by Maureen Orth.    The Versace family will issue no further comment on the matter.”"	1
"Shayanna Jenkins initially couldn't believe that her fiance, Aaron Hernandez, was found dead in prison.  In a new promo for her appearance on Dr. Phil next week, Jenkins breaks her silence on the NFL star's suicide while he was serving a life sentence for murdering Odin Lloyd, revealing that she thought reports of Hernandez's death were a ""hoax.""    RELATED: Former NFL Player Aaron Hernandez Found Guilty of Murder  ""I got a call at 5:27 a.m. in the morning from some official at [the] prison and he informed me that indeed Aaron was deceased, and at first I thought it was a hoax,"" Jenkins recalls, tearing up. ""I thought that this was some cruel person, that it was a cruel person playing a trick on me.""  ""I felt like we were looking so bright,"" she adds. ""We were going up a ladder to a positive direction.""    RELATED: Aaron Hernandez, Former NFL Player, Kills Himself in Prison, Officials Say  Hernandez was found dead on April 19, a week after he was acquitted of murder charges in the shooting deaths of two men in July 2012.  On Tuesday, a Massachusetts judge overturned Hernandez's murder conviction per state law, because he died before he exhausted the appeals process. The decision could open the door for Hernandez's former team, the New England Patriots, to issue payments to his family. The former football star signed a $40 million contract extension with the team in 2012, though the Patriots denied him a signing bonus payment after he was arrested for the murder of Lloyd in 2013.  In her interview with Dr. Phil, Jenkins says that her last conversation with Hernandez, with whom she shares a 4-year-old daughter, Avielle, ""had nothing to do with suicidal thoughts.""  ""Did he kill himself so that you could collect $6.5 million?"" Dr. Phil asks Jenkins, whose answer is not disclosed.

"First male gymnast alleges abuse by Larry Nassar  Clarification: An earlier version of this story misstated how Nassar would serve his prison sentences.  A male gymnast alleges in a lawsuit filed Wednesday that he was sexually abused by Larry Nassar, becoming the first known male victim to file suit against the former USA Gymnastics and Michigan State team doctor.  In one of six amended complaints filed in federal court Wednesday as part of a civil suit against Nassar, USA Gymnastics and Michigan State, Jacob Moore claims that he was sexually abused and harassed by Nassar in 2016.  According to the amended complaint, which was obtained by USA TODAY Sports on Thursday night, Moore alleges that he went to Nassar's home to receive treatment for a shoulder injury when he was 16 years old. After a female gymnast, who was also a minor at the time, entered the basement where Nassar was treating Moore, the doctor pulled down Moore's pants and exposed him to the female, according to the complaint.  Nassar told Moore that he would treat the gymnast's shoulder injury ""through acupuncture in his pubic area and in and around his genitalia,"" then proceeded to do so.  ""There is no known medical connection between shoulder pain which can be treated through acupuncture in the area of a male’s genitalia,"" the complaint states.  The amended complaint first was reported by International Gymnast Magazine.  Moore, who now is a gymnast at the University of Michigan, joins the more than 260 women and girls who have told law enforcement that they were sexually abused by Nassar.  More: Olympic world not better off after USOC's Scott Blackmun resigning  Related: American gymnasts detail sexual abuse to legislators on Capitol Hill  Larry Nassar case: Parents lash out: 'You violated our daughters'  Moore's sister, Kamerin, also is a victim and spoke during her victim-impact statement in January of how Nassar abused her brother.  Nassar is currently serving a 60-year sentence at a federal prison in Tucson, Ariz., on child pornography charges. The 54-year-old also has been sentenced to 40 to 175 years in one Michigan county and 40 to 125 years in another, both on sexual assault charges. He would serve the sentences concurrently.  Nassar worked for USA Gymnastics and Michigan State for decades and continued to sexually abuse and harass women and girls even as some of his victims spoke up. The Lansing State Journal, part of the USA TODAY Network, reported last year that more than a half dozen women or girls raised concerns about Nassar's actions to coaches, trainers, police or university officials between 1997 and 2015.  Nassar's abuse has sparked action at Michigan State, within the U.S. Olympic Committee and on Capitol Hill. Three gymnasts who were abused by Nassar, including 2012 Olympic gold medalist Jordyn Wieber, met with lawmakers and senators in Washington on Wednesday night.  An Indianapolis Star investigation of USA Gymnastics, begun in 2016, uncovered widespread sexual abuse of athletes and failures to alert authorities by coaches and others. The IndyStar, part of the USA TODAY Network, revealed the first allegations of abuse by Nassar and triggered a criminal prosecution that led to his imprisonment.

    One step at a time. Jay-Z opened up about his longtime friendship and feud with Kanye West in a wide-ranging interview with T: The New York Times Styles Magazine.  “I [talked to] Kanye the other day, just to tell him, like, he’s my brother. I love Kanye. I do,” the Brooklyn native, 47, told the Times’ executive editor Dean Baquet for a profile published on Wednesday, November 29. “It’s a complicated relationship with us.”  Jay-Z continued, “Kanye came into this business on my label. So I’ve always been like his big brother. And we’re both entertainers. It’s always been like a little underlying competition with your big brother. And we both love and respect each other’s art, too. So it’s like, we both — everyone wants to be the greatest in the world. You know what I’m saying? And then there’s like a lot of other factors that play in it. But … we gonna always be good.”  The “Family Feud” rapper then confirmed that there has been some tension between him and West, 40, since the Chicago native lashed out at him during an onstage rant in October 2016.  “But that happens. In the long relationship, you know, hopefully when we’re 89 we look at this six months or whatever time and we laugh at that,” Jay-Z said. “There’s gonna be complications in the relationship that we have to get through. And the only way to get through that is we sit down and have a dialogue and say, ‘These are the things that I’m uncomfortable with. These are the things that are unacceptable to me. This is what I feel.’ I’m sure he feels that I’ve done things to him as well. … I’m not a perfect human being by no stretch.”  The 21-time Grammy winner went on to call the “Famous” rapper “a very compassionate person” who simply “gets in trouble trying to help others.”	1

The Classmates released two projects, with Buddy Rich in 2009 and Cruis'n USA in 2010.[18] Scott mainly handled production work on both projects.

"Kelly Clarkson is adding to her Meaning of Life Tour, and she's inviting another female voice.  Maggie Rose has been selected as the third opening act on Clarkson's 2019 trek. She'll join Clarkson for a total of three dates; on March 9 at the PPL Center in Allentown, Pa., and a two-night stay at Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Conn., on March 14 and 15.  Rose made her debut on the country scene in 2010 with her cover of Kings of Leon's ""Use Somebody"" under the name of Margaret Durante. She's since proven herself as a dynamic artist with a larger-than-life voice, as demonstrated on her 2018 album Change the Whole Thing, which was recorded entirely live.  Rose's voice also appears as part of Land O' Lakes' ""She-I-O"" campaign that highlights female farmers. She and songwriter Liz Rose co-penned the reimagination of the famous ""Old MacDonald"" rhyme that's featured in the commercial.  Clarkson is clearly a fan of the powerhouse vocalist, sharing the video for her song ""It's You"" on Facebook and writing, ""DAMN Maggie Rose,"" with fire emojis, adding, ""Check her out y’all!"" The two also share a management company, and Rose called upon some of Clarkson's band members to play on Change the Whole Thing.  Clarkson is enlisting an all-female lineup for her upcoming tour. She's invited Kelsea Ballerini to perform as an opening act, along with Brynn Cartelli, who became the youngest winner of The Voice when she was crowned champion in Season 14 as a member of Clarkson's team. The Meaning of Life tour begins on Jan. 24 in Oakland, Calif. and hits Los Angeles, Chicago, Salt Lake City and more before wrapping on March 30 in South Carolina."	1

Taylor Swift is turning 28 on Dec. 13 and we’ve got EXCLUSIVE details on how BF Joe Alwyn has a romantic night in store to celebrate with his superstar sweetie.  What do you get a birthday girl who already has everything she could wish for? In Joe Alwyn‘s case, the 26-year-old is giving the gift of love and romance to girlfriend Taylor Swift as she turns 28 on Dec. 13. “Joe is planning a surprise romantic dinner and an intimate night alone with Taylor at a luxury hotel suite to help celebrate her birthday. Their romance has been amazing lately and Joe can’t wait to surprise Taylor with a passionate evening with just the two of them. Taylor and Joe are really falling in love with each other and things have never been better,” a source close to the British actor tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  “Joe has ordered dozens of red roses for their suite, several bottles of champagne and he is having a private chef who will cook them dinner and recreate one of her favorite dishes as part of their meal, sweet potato pancakes normally found at her favorite restaurant in Nashville. After a year of dating on the down-low, Taylor has slowly been allowing herself to be seen out in public with Joe. The “Ready For It” singer allowed herself to be photographed holding hands with Joe as they headed into her NYC pad’s front entrance on Dec. 9. She has a more private way to come and go from the place so it was a BIG DEAL that she finally was photographed showing PDA with him. See pics of Taylor’s epic 2017, here.  The next night she performed at London’s Jingle Ball and Tay was spotted out in the audience with Joe during pal Ed Sheeran‘s set. She had her arm around him while singing along to Ed’s smash “Thinking Out Loud” and was spotted hugging her boyfriend during other songs in the set. Fans freaked and posted the videos to Twitter and it was clear she is a-okay with the world knowing she’s with Joe.  HollywoodLifers, what’s the best birthday present you’ve ever received?	0

Angelina Jolie filed for divorce from Brad Pitt on Sept. 19 and HollywoodLife.com has obtained the actual divorce documents. Here, take a look at the papers in which she shockingly asks for no spousal or child support.  Just hours after it was revealed that Angelina, 41, filed for divorce from Brad, 52, on Sept. 20, HollywoodLife.com obtained the divorce papers that laid out exactly what Angie is asking for as she’s ending her marriage of just over two years.  Angelina cites “irreconcilable differences” in the 11-page divorce papers. But, she makes no demands for child support for their six children, nor any support for herself. She is, however, asking for full physical custody of the couple’s children, Shiloh, Knox, Vivienne, Zahara, Maddox, and Pax, and joint legal custody.  She’s also released a statement through her lawyer giving her reason for ending the marriage. “Angelina has filed for dissolution of the marriage,” Robert Offer, Angelina’s entertainment attorney, said in a statement on Sept. 20, per Harper’s Bazaar. “This decision was made for the health of the family. She will not be commenting, and asks that the family be given its privacy at this time.”  Although “irreconcilable differences” is the reason cited in the papers, sources also said that Brad has a weed addiction as well as a possible alcohol issues. On top of that, he has an “anger problem” — all of which serve as a major threat to their young children. It was also reported that Angelina was frustrated with Brad’s “methods” of parenting.  Brad and Angelina have been together since 2004 and married since 2014, so there’s certainly a lot that will need to be worked out in their split. Whether Angelina will be granted everything she is requesting is yet to be determined, but we’ll surely be keeping tabs on this shocking breakup!  HollywoodLifers, what do you think about Brangelina’s reasons for divorcing? Do you find it shocking that she doesn’t want any spousal or child support? Tell us below!	0
Over time, music genres shift in popularity, songwriting methods change, but one thing remains constant in popular music each year – terrible songs find their way to the top of the charts.  Billboard compiles an annual list of the top 100 singles at year’s end. We revisited the most popular songs of every year since 2000 and selected what we deemed to be the worst song from each year’s list of top 10 singles.  If you feel that times have changed for the worse, consider that we’re at least no longer inundated by tracks from the likes of Train and Hoobastank.  Here’s a list of the worst hit song from every year since 2000:  2000: “I Knew I Loved You” — Savage Garden  Foto: sourceYouTube/SavageGarden  1. “Breathe” – Faith Hill 2. “Smooth” – Santana featuring Rob Thomas 3. “Maria Maria” – Santana featuring The Product G&B 4. “I Wanna Know” – Joe 5. “Everything You Want” – Vertical Horizon 6. “Say My Name” – Destiny’s Child 7. “I Knew I Loved You”- Savage Garden 8. “Amazed” – Lonestar 9. “Bent” – Matchbox Twenty 10. “He Wasn’t Man Enough” – Toni Braxton  Lees ook op Business Insider De rente zou ruim 1,5% hoger zijn zonder de geldmachine van de ECB: ofwel minder pijn voor Nederlandse spaarders én geen korting op je pensioen  “I knew I loved you before I met you / I think I dreamed you into life” croon Australian pop duo Savage Garden on the chorus of this repulsively sentimental top 10 hit, a made-for-weddings track steeped in triteness.  2001: “Drops of Jupiter (Tell Me)” — Train  Foto: sourceYouTube/Train  1. “Hanging by a Moment” – Lifehouse 2. “Fallin'” – Alicia Keys 3. “All for You” – Janet Jackson 4. “Drops of Jupiter (Tell Me)” – Train 5. “I’m Real (Murder Remix)” – Jennifer Lopez featuring Ja Rule 6. “If You’re Gone” – Matchbox Twenty 7. “Let Me Blow Ya Mind” – Eve featuring Gwen Stefani 8. “Thank You” – Dido 9. “Again” – Lenny Kravitz 10. “Independent Women” – Destiny’s Child  Train’s nonsensical, aggravatingly cloying breakthrough single about a woman with “drops of jupiter” in her hair had staying power on radio for an interminable number of years.  2002: “How You Remind Me” — Nickelback  Foto: sourceYouTube/Nickelback  1. “How You Remind Me” – Nickelback 2. “Foolish” – Ashanti 3. “Hot in Herre” – Nelly 4. “Dilemma” – Nelly featuring Kelly Rowland 5. “Wherever You Will Go” – The Calling 6. “A Thousand Miles” – Vanessa Carlton 7. “In the End” – Linkin Park 8. “What’s Luv?” – Fat Joe featuring Ashanti 9. “U Got It Bad” – Usher 10. “Blurry” – Puddle of Mudd  To be fair, “How You Remind Me” is not the worst Nickleback song, but that makes it like two nails on a chalkboard compared to the group’s usual whole-handed scrape.  2003: “Right Thurr” — Chingy  Foto: sourceYouTube/Chingy  1. “In da Club” – 50 Cent 2. “Ignition (Remix)” – R. Kelly 3. “Get Busy” – Sean Paul 4. “Crazy in Love” – Beyoncé featuring Jay-Z 5. “When I’m Gone” – 3 Doors Down 6. “Unwell” – Matchbox Twenty 7. “Right Thurr” – Chingy 8. “Miss You” – Aaliyah 9. “Picture” – Kid Rock featuring Sheryl Crow 10. “Bring Me to Life” – Evanescence featuring Paul McCoy  Chingy’s debut single “Right Thurr” has a great beat from St. Louis hitmakers The Trak Starz, but his high-pitched, mediocre impression of obscene-rap humorist Too $hort, along with an irritating hook, ruin rather than make the track.  2004: “The Reason” — Hoobastank  Foto: sourceYouTube/Hoobastank  1. “Yeah!” – Usher featuring Lil Jon and Ludacris 2. “Burn” – Usher 3. “If I Ain’t Got You” – Alicia Keys 4. “This Love” – Maroon 5 5. “The Way You Move” – Outkast featuring Sleepy Brown 6. “The Reason” – Hoobastank 7. “I Don’t Wanna Know” – Mario Winans featuring Enya and P. Diddy 8. “Hey Ya!” – Outkast 9. “Goodies” – Ciara featuring Petey Pablo 10. “Lean Back” – Terror Squad  With a name like Hoobastank, it has to be trash – at least among the quality rap and R&B hits in this year’s top 10.  2005: “Boulevard of Broken Dreams” — Green Day  Foto: sourceYouTube/GreenDay  1. “We Belong Together” – Mariah Carey 2. 	0

Riverdale Stars Join Jimmy Fallon For A Hilarious Peanuts Spoof Written By Mick Joest  Random Article Blend In just two seasons, Riverdale has transformed from a bizarre Archie spin-off that some instantly wrote off to The CW's second most-watched show. The drama's success likely has more than just Netflix executives curious about what other seemingly innocent characters can be successfully rebooted with a dark twist, and The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon has already pushed another one out to the masses, complete with Riverdale's cast. Can Jimmy Fallon's Peanuts spoof be the next big thing in teen-oriented programming? Only one way to find out, blockheads. Facebook        Copy to clipboard Whoever wrote up that sketch for The Tonight Show needs a raise ASAP, as that was ridiculously hilarious. Jimmy Fallon played a great modern take on Charlie Brown, although he didn't get insulted nearly as much as the Charlie Brown we all know from back in the day. This take on Charlie Brown was a lot closer to KJ Apa's brooding portrayal as Archie Andrews, and yes, that does include writing songs and showing them to friends. For those that don't watch Riverdale, Archie also had a romantic affair with his teacher, although the Riverdale adults are a lot more intelligible than the Peanuts elders. Considering how often the RHS teens listen, though, the adults might as well be speaking gibberish! Perhaps the most hilarious thing about thisTonight Show sketch is how closely it follows Season 1 of Riverdale. The dead teen, the school dance, the constant mist, the dramatic asides that invade personal space -- it's all pretty consistent with The CW's hit series. Sadly, none of the actual cast members of Riverdale were seen until the tail end of the sketch, which is a real shame since Cheryl Blossom actress Madelaine Petsch would've made a killer Peppermint Patty. Hopefully, this isn't the last parody The Tonight Show does of Riverdale, since there's more than enough craziness happening in Season 2 to warrant Jimmy Fallon's reprisal as Charlie Brown for Round 2 next year. Just the thought of a short sketch in which Charlie Brown consults Lucy at the therapy booth about the town's serial killer in town should be enough to get some pens scratching paper in The Tonight Show writers room. If it isn't meant to be, at least Riverdale fans got more than a few chuckles out of this hilarious parody. The Tonight Show airs weeknights on NBC at 11:35 p.m. ET, and Riverdale's midseason finale airs Wednesday, December 13, at 8:00 p.m. ET.

"What happened to $650 million? An explosive legal battle between one of Hollywood's best-paid actors and the business managers he fired has laid bare tumultuous finances, outrageous spending and troubling behavior on Disney's new 'Pirates' movie in a case that could even change how the industry does business.  Early one afternoon in October 2012, Jake Bloom and Joel Mandel left their respective Beverly Hills offices, slipped into their luxury cars and embarked on the roughly 30-minute journey to the Hollywood Hills compound of their client, Johnny Depp. Bloom was a rumpled and graying lawyer whose disheveled style camouflaged an intellect exercised on behalf of such luminaries as Martin Scorsese and Sylvester Stallone. Mandel, then in his early 50s, was a tall, rather amiable accountant who favored loose-fitting jeans and looser-fitting shirts, sartorial code designed to assure his clients he was just another boy in their band as well as a top-flight business manager steeped in the arcana of arbitrage and amortization.  Both men had been close to Depp for years. Bloom, indeed, was such a confidant to the actor that he had even joined him for an induction ceremony into the Comanche nation when he played Tonto in The Lone Ranger; as for Mandel, he had accompanied Depp to his three-island property in the Bahamas, atolls Mandel had helped his client buy for a total of $5.35 million.  These men were part of Depp's inner circle, at least as far as any lawyer or accountant could belong to the inner circle of an artist this mercurial, one with a skull-and-crossbones tattoo on his leg and ""Death is certain"" scrawled beneath it, whose soul mates were such creative titans as Marlon Brando, Keith Richards and Hunter S. Thompson — the journalist whose ashes Depp fired from a cannon hauled to the top of a 153-foot tower, a tribute for which the actor says he paid $5 million.  Leaving their cars that day, the advisers approached one of Depp's five houses on a dead-end stretch of North Sweetzer Avenue. A modernist affair that was simply referred to as 1480, the building had been converted into a recording studio and was an appendage to an eight-bedroom, castle-like mansion once owned by music producer Berry Gordy. One of the star's two omnipresent assistants led the men in, past a painting that British artist Banksy had created for Depp, and into a den, where the actor was leaning back in a slightly battered chair, surrounded by dozens upon dozens of classic guitars.  After the obligatory small talk, the visitors got to the point: Depp's cash flow had reached a crisis point, they declared. Even though the star had become wildly wealthy (later, Mandel would claim Depp earned more than $650 million in the 13-plus years he had been represented by The Management Group, the company Mandel had started in 1987 with his brother Robert), there just wasn't enough liquid money to cover Depp's $2 million in monthly bills.  Without a fire sale, Depp — then arguably the biggest star in Hollywood and certainly one of the best paid, thanks to the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise — would never be able to meet his obligations. Not the payments on his portfolio of real estate around the world. Not the impulse purchases such as the three Leonor Fini paintings he had bought from a Manhattan gallery (the first two for $320,000, the third as a $245,000 gift for then-girlfriend Amber Heard). Not the $3.6 million he paid annually for his 40-person staff. Not the $350,000 he laid out each month to maintain his 156-foot yacht. And not the hundreds of thousands of dollars he paid to sustain his ex-partner, Vanessa Paradis, and their children, Lily-Rose and Jack.  Mandel dug into his briefcase for a one-page summary he had prepared, but Depp waved it away. Still, after three hours, the actor agreed to a compromise: He would sell his beloved Amphitrite, the yacht he had bought for $10 million and spent $8 million renovating, where he'd hosted such friends as Brad Pitt a"	1
James revealed it was 20 years since the premiere of Dawson’s Creek and now we’re sad (Picture: MediaPunch/REX/Shutterstock)  Here’s something that’ll make you feel super old: It’s been 20 years since the premiere of Dawson’s Creek.  The little TV show that made stars out of James Van Der Beek, Katie Holmes, Michelle Williams and Joshua Jackson was first shown on WB on 20 January 1998. And to celebrate the show’s 20th anniversary James – who, you might remember, played lead character Dawson Leery – took to Instagram to post an epic throwback pic and reminisce about the show that ‘changed our lives and launched our careers’.  Alongside a snap of himself, Katie, Joshua and Michelle, James wrote in the caption: ‘#tbt Squad ‘97. I’d known these people all of 7 days when this pic was taken. 20 years ago this week ? the little pilot we shot in that small town for that fledgling network aired, changed our lives and launched our careers.  Advertisement  Advertisement  ‘Thank you to the Wilmington, North Carolina crew and community who raised us & kept us sane, thank you to the many talented writers and producers who gave of your hearts talents and put up with us.’  James, of course, thanks the fans that kept the show on the air for six season, and he also made a rather startling revelation – that he’s never actually watched Dawson’s Creek himself. For shame!  ‘And thank you especially to the fans of the show. It’s a funny relationship we have… your experience of this project is what you saw on camera, while my memories are mostly what I experienced off of it.  ‘And yes, it’s true that I haven’t seen most episodes (it became healthier at a certain point to just commit 100% on the day and let it go completely), but the beauty of this arrangement is that my impression of the show now is what you’ve all reflected back to me over the years… and it’s been lovely to witness.  ‘So thank you to anyone who’s ever expressed appreciation for the work we did – it makes me feel proud to be associated with these three fine people (and the rest of the cast), and proud to have been a part of #DawsonsCreek. This one will always have a special little place in my heart.’  And James isn’t the only one who was feeling a bit nostalgic this week – Katie Holmes, AKA Joey Potter, also posted a sweet pic of her Dawson’s Creek pilot script.  Advertisement  Advertisement  ‘I am so grateful that 20 years ago we premiered Dawson’s Creek,’ she wrote. ‘I am so honored to have been a part of it :) such wonderful memories. Such wonderful friends. Such incredible fans. Thank you all!’  The very last episode of Dawson’s Creek aired in May 2003 after six seasons. Fingers crossed they’ll be on Netflix any day now.

Even before he steps on the field for Super Bowl 52, Danny Amendola thinks he’s a winner, thanks to his luck in finding a ‘great’ and ‘loving’ woman like Olivia Culpo!  As a wide receiver for the New England Patriots, Danny Amendola, 32, knows a thing or two about amazing moves and jaw-dropping plays. However, the biggest catch of his life may have come off the field in the form of Olivia Culpo, 25. Danny couldn’t hold back about his amazing girlfriend while doing press ahead of Super Bowl 52. When asked about whether or not he and the former Miss Universe have replaced his teammate Tom Brady, 40, and Gisele Bundchen, 37, as the next Patriots “it couple,” he laughed.  “It’s never been about a competition or anything,” he said, according to E! News. “[Olivia] is a great girl, and she’s loving and I’m lucky to have her.” He’s right. Olivia’s love was on full display when Danny made the game-winning catch during the AFC Championship game. Danny made a “falling backwards, tope-tapping grab” to put the Patriots up over the Jacksonville Jaguars, and when the game was over, Olivia was there to give her baby some sugar. She screamed in delight while jumping into his arms, straddling her baby while giving him a much-deserved kiss.  Danny and Olivia have been romantically linked since February 2016. It was luck that really brought them together. “I met her on the corner of Hollywood and Vine, just walking down the street and we bumped into one another,” Danny said when recounting how her first met her, according to the Providence Journal. “”It’s crazy.” When asked what he likes most about her, he said it was her ride or die behavior “She’s supportive, man. She’s just really supportive. That’s it.”  Expect that “supportive” girlfriend to join Gisele and the rest of the Patriots “wives and girlfriends” for the big game on Feb. 4. The Patriots take on the Philadelphia Eagles in Minneapolis, Minnesota. With the temperatures expected to be around 11-degrees Fahrenheit, the chances of her rocking the Daisy Dukes and thigh-high boots, like she did for Super Bowl 51, may be slim. Though, from hearing how much Danny is in love with her, it probably doesn’t matter what she wears, so long as she’s there for the game.  Are you just loving the love between Danny and Olivia, HollywoodLifers?	1

Olympic gymnast Simone Biles is used to flipping and twisting her way to victory on the mats - but now the gold medal winner has fallen head over heels for another reason entirely.  The 20-year-old has confirmed a romance with fellow gymnast Stacey Ervin, taking to Instagram on Monday to post a sweet tribute to her new boyfriend.  Alongside an image of the couple sharing a tender embrace, Simone, who trains at the same gym as Stacey in Texas, posted the caption: 'Always smiling with you.'  Head over heels! Simon Biles has confirmed her romance with fellow gymnast Stacey Ervin  Awwww! 'Always smiling with you,' the 20-year-old Olympian captioned a photo of the cute couple staring at each other on a balcony  And it seems Simone is not the only one ready to shout about the romance from the rooftops.  Ervin let slip the secret about their relationship a day before on his own account, after accompanying Simone to her induction into the Gymnastics Hall Of Fame.  'Words cannot express how incredibly proud I am of you, all you've accomplished and how well you carry yourself,' he wrote alongside a picture of the couple at the ceremony, smiling with their arms around each other.  'You make me feel like I am the luckiest man alive. Congratulations on your induction to the USA Gymnastics Hall of Fame!'  He added: 'I can't wait to see what the future has in store.'  It is not the first time that Simone has featured on her boyfriend's account, however, and vice versa.  Earlier this month, Simone and Ervin posted pictures of themselves posing with a group of friends at a Bryson Tiller concert in Houston, Texas, with neither choosing to tag their significant other in the post, no doubt keen to keep their relationship under wraps for a little longer.  Young love: Earlier this month, both Simone and her Stacey (center) posted images of themselves at a Bryson Tiller concert with a group of friends  Secret: Neither Simone or Stacey chose to tag their significant other in the image, which were taken in Houston, Texas, no doubt keen to maintain some privacy around their relationship  Five-time Olympic medalist Simone opened up about her love life in an interview with ET earlier this year, admitting she had 'never had a boyfriend in [her] life'.  'At 20 years old I feel like you should have gone through those things and gone on dates,' she said. 'I have been on like, maybe one proper date.'  Simone, who earned four gold medals and one bronze at the Rio Olympics last summer, previously did not have much time to devote to dating due to her rigorous training schedule, which keeps her busy six days a week.  But her budding romance wasn't the only exciting element of the weekend for Simone, who was reunited with her fellow Final Five members of the 2016 Olympics team, both at the Hall of Fame ceremony and the P&G Championships in Anaheim, California.  Simone shared some pics with her former team members at the induction, posing alongside Madison Kocian, Laurie Hernandez and Aly Raisman.  Olympians: Simone also shared some pics with her fellow Final Five members at the induction, Aly Raisman (left), Laurie Hernandez (center left), and Madison Kocian (center right)  Flying high: Simone let slip over the weekend that she has returned to the gym, suggesting that she may have her sights set on a spot in the 2020 Olympic team  Winner: Stacey attended the University of Michigan, where he competed as a member of the men's artistic gymnastics team  The fifth member of the team, Gabby Douglas, did not attend the ceremony, having already been inducted into the Hall of Fame after competing in the 2012 Olympics, where she won the all-around gold medal which Simone clinched four years later.  However Gabby and the rest of the Final Five were reunited at the national gymnastics championships over the weekend, where they supported and cheered on the next generation of gymnasts.  Having taken a break from gymnastics for the past year - during which time she competed on D	1
According to a report by People, Nikki Bella has been cast in the upcoming season of Dancing with the Stars.  A source tells People that Nikki and Drew Scott of the HGTV series Property Brothers have both signed onto compete on the upcoming season of ABC’s long-running reality dance competition series.  Season 25 of Dancing with the Stars premieres opposite Raw on Monday, Sept. 18.  Nikki would be the third wrestler to compete on Dancing with the Stars, following Stacy Keibler and Chris Jericho.  In early 2006, Keibler, competed in the second season of the show, alongside her dance partner, Tony Dovolani. Keibler was eliminated in the final episode, coming in third to NFL legend Jerry Rice, who placed second in the final round of the competition, and singer Drew Lachey, the winner of the season. Two of the judges, Bruno Tonioli and Len Goodman, felt Keibler should have at least placed second. Oddsmakers had also considered her the favorite to win the competition.  Jericho competed on season 12 in spring 2011, alongside Cheryl Burke. He was the fifth contestant eliminated on the show.	1
"Kylie Jenner took the internet by storm when she announced the name of her new baby girl.  On Tuesday afternoon, the 20-year-old reality star shared the first photo of her baby girl holding her finger. She captioned the Instagram shot, ""Stormi.""  Kim Kardashian followed the photo up with a tweet of her own, confirming the name with a simple emoji:  ⛈ — Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) February 6, 2018  Kylie and Travis Scott welcomed their baby girl at Cedars-Sinani in Los Angeles on Thursday, Feb. 1, the same hospital Kylie's nieces and nephews were born.  After keeping her pregnancy completely under wraps for 9 months, Kylie confirmed the news on Sunday before the Super Bowl, calling it ""the most beautiful, empowering, and life changing experience I've had in my entire life.""  Unfortunately for Kylie, Twitter seems to think her baby's name sounds a bit like the name of the porn star President Donald Trump may or may not have paid to keep quiet, Stormy Daniels. Others are cracking jokes about a Kardahian/Jenner family's weather-releated names, writing things like, ""It's going to be Stormi, with a chance of Reign, in the North of Chicago.""

Anyone who has seen “The Ellen DeGeneres Show” knows DeGeneres love surprises—and Justin Timberlake.  So as her 60th birthday rolled around, it was only fitting that Timberlake had a surprise of his own up his sleeve for the beloved talk show host.  On the episode that will air on her birthday, Jan. 26, Timberlake appears via satellite with a special message for DeGeneres.  “Hey baby. I’m rehearing for the Super Bowl, rehearsing for the tour. I’m so sorry I can’t be there to kick off your birthday week,” he said. “You know I’d like to be there but I need to make sure we are great.”  Of course, that’s not at all. The “Filthy” singer then serenaded DeGeneres—with the help of his band The Tennessee Kids—with a version of “Happy Birthday” and had a bouquet of pink peonies delivered to her.  Watch the sweet moment below:  While Timberlake did refuse to confirm any rumors about special guests at his Super Bowl performance, he also invited DeGeneres to join him.  “You’re welcome to come out with me if you want,” he said. “You’re very good at dancing too.”  DeGeneres declined the offer, but did ask him to send her a secret sign during the performance.  “I know there’s a lot going on but during the performance, could you give some kind of signal so I know you’re thinking of me? Like a dance move and a rubbing of the stomach… ?”  LOL!  He agreed, saying, “Well, you are my other girl. Although that feels creepy doesn’t it.”  Aw, Justin, we sure do love your sense of humor!  via GIPHY  Although seriously amazing, Timberlake wasn’t even the only musical treat DeGeneres received for her birthday. Guest Kristen Bell gave the birthday girl a shirt with the saying “It took 60 years to look this good.”  Bell then introduced her husband, Dax Shepard, who apparently wrote an original song about how DeGeneres made 60 look “so sexy”. The actor, all dressed up in a white tuxedo, sang: “You make 60 look so sexy. I know Portia’s your girl, but if you were single and straight I’d rock your world.”  Other lyrics included, “If I could be with you, I’d be the luckiest guy then you could hook me up with a check from Shutterfly” and “You get better with time, like a really fine wine and did I mention all your money?”  We do have to point out that the voice doing the singing sounds an awful lot like John Legend, but we’ll say it’s totally Shepard because that makes it all the more hilarious.  Happy Birthday, Ellen!	1
California girl! Ashley Tisdale shows off her petite figure in 'beach bum' T-shirt and leggings on a trip to hair salon    She lives in Southern California, famous for its beautiful sandy shoreline.  And on Wednesday, Ashley Tisdale celebrated that fact by wearing a bright pink vest with the words Beach Bum on the front in orange and blue capital letters as she dropped by the 901 Hair Salon in the West Hollywood district of Los Angeles.    The 29-year-old teamed the eye-catching tee with black cropped leggings and pastel-coloured Nike trainers and accessorised with a large black handbag, which she slung across her body, and a large pair of sunglasses.  Shore looks great: Ashley Tisdale wore an electric pink vest with the words Beach Bum across the front in capital letters as she went to a salon in the West Hollywood neighbourhood of Los Angeles on Wednesday    Clutching a bottle of water and a blue notepad in one hand, she stopped on the sidewalk to check something on her smart-phone.  It's not clear what Ashley had done at the hair salon as her blonde tresses still showed a couple of inches of dark roots.  Missing from her trip was fiancé Christopher French. The pair started dating in December 2012 and got engaged eight months later after Christopher proposed at the top of New York's Empire State Building, slipping an enormous double halo, cushion-cut diamond ring on her finger.    Although a date for their nuptials is unknown, Ashley recently had a Bachelorette party and told E! News last year: 'I have a wedding planner so that's a lot easier.'  Beachy keen: The 29-year-old teamed the vest with black cropped leggings and pastel-coloured Nike trainers    Meanwhile, both Ashley and Christopher have been busy with their careers.  Young & Hungry, the series she exec produces and stars in and he produces the music for, has been nominated for a Teen Choice award, news which she shared excitedly on Instagram.    'WHOA!!!! I produce that show! I know @wree!! Congrats to the beautiful @wree and Young and Hungry cast on the Teen Choice nominations! #GOVOTE'.  Christopher added his best wishes in a tweet, saying: 'Huge congrats to the entire @YoungandHungry team on the Teen Choice nom! Proud to be part of such an awesome group on a killer show #govote.'    Phoning it in: The actress's blingy diamond engagement ring was clearly visible as she checked something out on her smart phone  In the ABC Family series Emily Osment plays a feisty food blogger with Ashley as a gay magazine editor.    The High School Musical star was also voted Social Media Superstar at last month's Young Hollywood Awards, beating Ariana Grande, Chrissy Teigen and Bella Thorne.    She also put in an appearance to promote the show at the Disney and ABC summer Television Critics Association press tour in Beverly Hills last month.  Comfy chic: Ashley and her Annie Automatic star beau Christopher French were pictured in the Soho district of New York last week                        	1
    Looking good! Kevin Smith updated fans on his health and revealed that he’s close to his goal of losing 50 lbs since suffering a heart attack in February.  “Today, I am down a total of 43 pounds! Only 7 more pounds until I’ve shed the 50 my doctor told me to lose following the heart attack,” the Weight Watchers ambassador, 47, captioned an Instagram pic on Wednesday, June 13, crediting magician Penn Jillette and Ray Cronise for kickstarting his weight loss, and Weight Watchers for helping him slim down. “This #wwambassador is now at the absolute thinnest I’ve been since I finished high school! And while I may look a little better, I FEEL f—king fantastic! It’ll be a few weeks, but I’m ready to lose that final 7 points! And when I hit my goal, I’ll let you know where I started.”  Smith made headlines in February after revealing that he experienced a “massive” heart attack backstage at an L.A. comedy show. He recently showed off his weight loss in May, telling his 1.2 million Instagram followers that he’s lost 32 lbs since the traumatic experience.  The filmmaker previously opened up about his weight loss journey exclusively to Us Weekly back in April.  “For me, food was not like fuel. It wasn’t, like, you eat food because it powers your body and you move on,” he said at the time. “I’m an American who grew up in the ‘70s when America figured out, if we start putting more sugar in everything, they’ll buy it. So sugar starts showing up in the bread and everything.”  Smith added that he didn’t think he was having a heart attack when it happened, given that he lost 85 lbs three years ago after cutting sugar out of his diet entirely. “I was sweaty, I thought I couldn’t catch my breath, I felt nauseated, but I didn’t think of those as heart attack symptoms,” he explained. “I couldn’t piece it together, but that’s me being incredibly stupid because my mom has two stents in her heart and my father died of a massive heart attack at 67.”	1

"2017 animated short film  Olaf's Frozen Adventure is a 2017 American 3D computer-animated featurette, produced by Walt Disney Animation Studios and released by Walt Disney Pictures. It is directed by Kevin Deters and Stevie Wermers, who previously directed the holiday-themed Prep & Landing shorts. The film features the voices of Josh Gad, Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, and Jonathan Groff reprising their roles from the original 2013 film Frozen. It premiered in 3D in theaters for a limited time engagement[5] in front of Pixar's Coco on November 22, 2017, and made its television debut on ABC on December 14, 2017.[6]  Plot [ edit ]  It is the first Christmas season since the gates reopened and Anna and Elsa host a celebration for all of Arendelle. When the townspeople unexpectedly leave early to enjoy their individual holiday traditions, the sisters realize they have no family traditions of their own. Elsa laments the fact that because she had isolated herself most of her life, she and Anna were unable to spend time with each other. Olaf decides to look for traditions with Sven's help.  Going through the town, Olaf encounters various family traditions relating to Christmas, Hanukkah and Winter solstice. After a visit to Oaken, Olaf, Sven and their sleigh full of traditions travel through the snowy tundra only for a coal (from a portable sauna that Oaken had given them) to set the sleigh on fire. They slide down a hill and Olaf and Sven end up separated by a chasm. With only a fruit cake, Olaf attempts to travel through the woods and is attacked by wolves.  Meanwhile, Anna and Elsa discover some forgotten items in their attic. Sven returns to Kristoff and informs him (in vain), Anna, and Elsa of Olaf's plight. They gather the residents of Arendelle to go look for Olaf. Elsewhere, Olaf manages to escape the wolves, but loses the fruit cake to a hawk and gives up by a tree not too far from the kingdom. Anna and Elsa find Olaf and cheer him up by revealing that they do have a tradition: Himself. After Elsa had shut herself away, Anna began annually sliding cards and dolls of Olaf under her door. As they all celebrate the holidays, the hawk drops the fruit cake on Olaf. Upon getting the fruit cake back, Olaf declares it ""A Christmas miracle!""  Cast [ edit ]  Production [ edit ]  On February 9, 2016, the short film was announced as a television special, to be aired on ABC,[7] produced by Roy Conli, and directed by Kevin Deters and Stevie Wermers. The title was revealed during the airing of The Making of Frozen: Return to Arendelle on ABC in 2016, and it was announced that it would feature original songs by Elyssa Samsel and Kate Anderson, the sister of Frozen songwriter Kristen Anderson-Lopez. However, in June 2017, it was announced that the film would instead receive a limited time[5] theatrical release in front of Disney·Pixar's Coco, as it was deemed too cinematic for television. The main original cast, Josh Gad, Kristen Bell, Idina Menzel, and Jonathan Groff, returned, and the story follows Olaf as he tries to find the best holiday traditions for Anna, Elsa, and Kristoff.[3][8]  The music was recorded by an 80-piece orchestra in May 2017. The short was the filmmakers' first musical. They noted the requirement to keep the plot ""pretty simple"", and commented that they removed anything that diverted too much from that story. The fruitcake jokes in the short are a continuing motif from the filmmakers' previous project Prep & Landing. As they crafted the story, the Frozen team had barely started sketching out the plot of Frozen 2.[9]  Soundtrack [ edit ]  There are four original songs in the film, written by Elyssa Samsel and Kate Anderson, titled ""Ring in the Season"", ""The Ballad of Flemmingrad"", ""That Time of Year"" and ""When We're Together"". Film's score has been composed by Christophe Beck and Jeff Morrow. The full soundtrack was released on November 3, 2017 by Walt Disney Records.[10][11]  Original Motion Picture Soundtrack No. Title P"	1
I'm not sure how it happened, but at this point, we're mere days away from the end of 2018. As we round out the year, let's take a walk down memory lane, shall we? This year saw an incoming of so many new trends, and naturally, that meant others were pushed to the sidelines, if not trampled completely. More so than anyone else, celebs were the early adopters of 2018's most cutting-edge trends, from bucket hats to baguette bags, which means they were also the first people to make like Ariana Grande and say thank you, next to their outdated pieces.  In the interest of taking stock of what's en vogue on the celebrity front, we investigated which outdated celebrity fashion trends never made it past December 31, 2017, and found seven major trends that altogether vanished from celebrities' closets from then till now. Have you also noticed that items like bomber jackets and off-the-shoulder tops are nowhere to be found? Keep reading to see which pieces are out of sight, out of mind and which fresher styles have replaced them.	1
The Spice Girls have reportedly agreed to a reunion in 2018 which will see them record both a new album and a one-off TV special.  The pop group originally formed in 1994, before splitting in 2000 following the recording of three studio albums. The group reunited for a live tour from 2007-08, while they last performed together at the closing ceremony of the 2012 London Olympic Games.  A new report has claimed that all five original members of The Spice Girls – Mel B, Victoria Beckham, Emma Bunton, Mel C and Geri Halliwell – have been taking part in secret talks about the group’s possible return since the summer, with a 2018 date now agreed for a reunion.  Advertisement  “The five of them have been locked in secret talks since the summer, and finally they are all on-board for a 2018 reunion,’ a source told The Sun. “As it stands, they will be working together on a series of projects, which will include an album and a TV special celebrating the Spice Girls.  “Getting Victoria to agree has been a coup for everyone involved, given she has always been the person holding back on a reunion,” the source added.  http://link.brightcove.com/services/player/?bctid=3692533877001  Advertisement  Back in July 2016, three members of The Spice Girls sparked rumours of a reunion after posting a video which hinted at a possible tour.	0
As you watch the final seconds of Big Little Lies, you have no questions left. Yes, there’s a random person following the fivesome around while snapping clandestine photographs, but do you really care to find out who it is? No, because these five powerful women are finally living their best lives, as they deserve. The big questions of the series, like the true identity of Amabella’s biter and Jane’s rapist, have been answered. Both stem from Perry, who’s dead. So, the figure lurking aroud our heroines feels like a reminder there will always be lies to cover up and someone who will find them. Though, it’s not like viewers are praying Celeste and her friends will be exposed for their hand in Perry's death — especially not in the current climate , where we’re learning just how prevalent sexual predation really is	1
"Bella Thorne and Tana Mongeau's new relationship is only getting stronger after celebrating Bella's 20th birthday together.  See, they just get each other on another level. For example, licking each other's tongues? Not weird at all for either of them. Actually, they enjoy that sort of thing. Which is why Tana shared a video of Bella licking her tongue yesterday.  I'm not talking that kind of tongue tap people do when they're dared to do it or something. I'm talking a nice long LICK. And even though just looking at the still image of the girls preparing for the lick gives me the heebie-jeebies, I gotta respect that this is their thing.

"NEW YORK -- Rose McGowan's Twitter account was suspended overnight, temporarily muting a central figure in the allegations against Harvey Weinstein.  McGowan said late Wednesday that Twitter had suspended her from tweeting after the social media company said she broke its rules. On her Instagram account, McGowan said ""there are powerful forces at work"" and pleaded for others to ""be my voice.""  Twitter issued a statement late Thursday morning explaining the decision. It said McGowan's account ""was temporarily locked because one of her Tweets included a private phone number, which violates of our Terms of Service.""  Twitter added that the tweet was removed and her account has been unlocked.  The Tweet was removed and her account has been unlocked. We will be clearer about these policies and decisions in the future. 2/3 — Twitter Safety (@TwitterSafety) October 12, 2017  ""Twitter is proud to empower and support the voices on our platform, especially those that speak truth to power,"" the company said in a statement. ""We stand with the brave women and men who use Twitter to share their stories, and will work hard every day to improve our processes to protect those voices.""  A-list stars join Harvey Weinstein accusers  The New York Times earlier reported that McGowan was among the numerous women sexually harassed by Weinstein, who paid McGowan a financial settlement in 1997.  McGowan on Tuesday tweeted ""now I am allowed to say rapist.""  McGowan also recently called Ben Affleck ""a liar"" on Twitter and suggested the actor knew about Weinstein's conduct. Representatives for Affleck haven't responded to messages regarding that allegation.  McGowan's suspension on Twitter prompted an outcry from some accusing the social media site of selective censorship. Twitter has repeatedly come under fire for failing to effectively rein in hate speech and vitriol directed at women on its platform.  Anthony Bourdain and Jamie Lee Curtis were among those to react sharply to McGowan's account being suspended:  And now THIS? You allow Twitter freedom to our president but you silence a woman speaking out about sexual harassment? @rosemcgowan — Jamie Lee Curtis (@jamieleecurtis) October 12, 2017  Everyone go into @rosemcgowan's account and RT three recent tweets.

"Chris Brown reportedly does not want to raise his daughter in public light, like rapper Kanye West and reality TV star Kim Kardashian's daughter, North West.  According to Hollywood Life, the 25-year-old R&B singer, who allegedly has a nine-month-old baby girl named Royalty with long time friend and former model Nia Amey, wants to give the toddler a normal childhood.  ""No disrespect to Kim or Kanye, Chris thinks they're both talented and successful people at their respective craft. But as parents… he wouldn't do half of the s**t they do,"" a source said.  ""Parading Royalty around and taking her to places she doesn't have business being for the sole sake of having her photograph taken is not something Chris will be doing. That's absolutely crazy to him and he doesn't understand why anyone would use their child like that… for fame and publicity,"" the insider added.  It was previously reported that Bruce Jenner is upset that Kim Kardashian, 34, is treating North West like an ""accessory"".  The Keeping Up With The Kardashians star previously received backlash on social media with people branding her a ""bad mother"" after dressing North in a see-through Givenchy outfit during the Paris Fashion Week.  Recently, North threw tantrums twice during the New York Fashion Week. The tiny tot burst into tears during her father Kanye's show with Adidas and the toddler also cried at the Alexander Wang runway show.  ""Chris already knows how vicious the business is and he wants to keep his daughter as far away from it as possible,"" the source went on.  ""The last thing he wants is for his girl to grow up around a bunch of fake people who cater to her like she's one of the Obama girls,"" the insider said. ""Chris didn't grow up like that and while he's going to give Royalty ever advantage possible, he wants her to know that she's not entitled to anything and that she will have to work in life."""	0

"2017 single by Taylor Swift  ""Look What You Made Me Do"" is a song recorded by American singer-songwriter Taylor Swift, released on August 25, 2017, by Big Machine Records as the lead single from her sixth studio album Reputation (2017). Swift wrote and produced the song with her co-producer Jack Antonoff. ""Look What You Made Me Do"" is an electroclash and pop song,[1] with lyrics about various issues that built Swift's reputation. Right Said Fred band members are also credited as songwriters, as it interpolates the melody of their song ""I'm Too Sexy"" (1991).  The song broke a string of records, including the record for the most plays in a single day on Spotify. Commercially, ""Look What You Made Me Do"" has topped the charts in Australia, Canada, Croatia, the Czech Republic, Greece, Ireland, Israel, Japan, Lebanon, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, Scotland, Slovakia, the United Kingdom, and the United States. It has also received Platinum certifications in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Italy, New Zealand, Poland, Sweden and the United States. It also received Diamond certification in Brazil.  The song received a polarized response from music critics. Its music video was directed by Joseph Kahn and upon its release on YouTube, it attained the most views in its first 24 hours of release, more than any other music video on the site at that time.[2]  Promotion and release [ edit ]  On August 23, 2017, Swift announced that the first single from her upcoming sixth album, titled Reputation, would come out the following night.[3] The song was released to streaming services on August 25,[4] and earned over eight million streams within twenty-four hours of its Spotify release, breaking the record for the highest first-day streaming for a single track.[5] The record was surpassed four times: in 2018 by Drake's ""God's Plan"",[6] XXXTentacion's ""SAD!"" the day after his death, and Ariana Grande's ""Thank U, Next"" on November 5, 2018. Mariah Carey surpassed the record with All I Want for Christmas Is You on December 25, 2018 and has held the record ever since. ""Look What You Made Me Do"" was then released the next day onto iTunes for digital download through Big Machine Records[7] and onto Italian contemporary hit radio[8] before a United Kingdom radio release on August 26, 2017.[9] It impacted American contemporary hit radio three days afterwards.[10] A CD single release followed in Germany on October 27, 2017.[11]  A lyric video heavily based on the Saul Bass imagery used in the film Vertigo was released through Swift's official Vevo account on August 25, 2017.[12] The video was produced by Swift and Joseph Kahn and directed by ODD.[13] It gained more than 19 million views during its first 24 hours on YouTube, surpassing ""Something Just like This"" by The Chainsmokers and Coldplay as the most viewed lyric video within that time period.[14] As of October 2019, the lyric video on YouTube has amassed over 120 million views.  Composition and lyrical interpretation [ edit ]  ""Look What You Made Me Do"" was written and produced by Swift and Jack Antonoff, it runs for 3 minutes and 31 seconds.[15][7] Music critics have described the track as a hybrid of electroclash and pop,[1] as well as a dance-pop[16] and an electropop song.[12] It emphasizes the blame that is placed on an enemy, in particular the line ""I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined,"" which was inspired by Arya Stark's kill list in the television series Game of Thrones.[17] The middle eight of the song features Swift saying, ""I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now / Why? / Oh, 'cause she's dead!""[citation needed] ""Look What You Made Me Do"" is performed in the key of A minor with a tempo of 128 beats per minute.[18] Swift's vocals span from G 3 to F 5 .[18] Brittany Spanos of Rolling Stone noted a ""nightmarish aesthetic"" present in the song, and believed it to be a continuation of the ""antagonistic persona"" from ""Bad Blood"".[16] Richard Fair"	0

ADVERTISEMENT  It doesn’t seem to be Fergie’s week.  Following criticism of her national anthem performance on the NBA All-Star Game, now the singer, real name Stacy Ann Ferguson, is said to be out of hip-hop group Black Eyed Peas (BEP).  Black Eyed Peas founding member will.i.am (William James Adams) told the Daily Star that Fergie is not on the group’s seventh studio album.  “We are now a trio. I don’t know why Fergie isn’t on the project. You will have to ask Fergie that,” he said.  The other members of the group which formed in 1995 are apl.de.ap (Allan Pineda) and Taboo (Jaime Luis Gomez). Fergie joined them in 2002.  Adams revealed that the group has a WhatsApp group chat called “Black Eyed Peas family” which Fergie isn’t a part of. However, Pussycat Dolls lead singer Nicole Sherzinger is in it.  “It has nothing to do with making music or money. It’s about friendship,” explained Adams of the group chat, not mentioning if they will be working with her. They did consider her as a member in the early 2000s, but she had to decline for another project.  He also said there’s no news from Scherzinger if the Pussycat Dolls will make a comeback.  After finding success with Black Eyed Peas, Fergie went solo in 2006, then worked with the group in 2009. She began working on her second solo album “Double Dutchess” in 2013 and released it in September 2017.  In June 2017, rumors circulated that Fergie had left the group. She and Adams both clarified that she was still in it but that she was focusing on her new solo album.  Black Eyed Peas’ hits with Fergie include “Where Is the Love”, “My Humps” and “I Gotta Feeling”. The group sans Fergie released its first single in seven years last January titled “Street Livin’”.

Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban are not the buyers of an opulent, $39 million New York City townhouse mansion, as was widely reported in property gossip columns around the globe last week — but they are the sellers of a rustic-luxe rural retreat about half an hour outside Nashville, listed at $3.45 million. The Honolulu-born Australian actress and Oscar winner, most recently nominated for her supporting role in “Lion,” and the platinum-selling New Zealand-born country music superstar purchased the almost 36-acre, two-parcel spread in two 2007 transactions that totaled $2.45 million.  A long drive meanders through a pristine stand of woods and swoops across an open field as it makes its way to the front of a red-brick residence with four bedrooms and four full and two half bathrooms in not quite 5,100 square feet. The traditional exterior belies the clean-lined, open-plan and decidedly modern interior spaces that include a steeply pitched vaulted and skylight-pierced ceiling in the living room, a stainless steel-accented fireplace in the family room and a window-lined dining room that flows into a galley-style kitchen with speckled granite counters on stainless steel cabinets.  Bedrooms are well separated for privacy, and include a top-floor master suite that comprises a sitting room, separate bedroom, luxury bathroom and immense walk-in closet perfect for a couple of frequent red-carpet walkers. Along with several guest bedrooms and a den, the lower level has a large fitness room and a small office that open to the yard. A separate cottage works well for guests, a caretaker or live-in domestic staff.  Popular on Variety  In addition to substantial holdings in and around Sydney, the Kidman-Urbans’ property portfolio includes a palatial, 12,000-plus-square-foot mansion in Nashville landed in 2008 for $3.47 million; a contemporary Beverly Hills home scooped up in 2008 for $4.75 million; and a snazzy duplex condo in lower Manhattan’s West Chelsea.  listing photos: French King Fine Properties	1
"Charlize Theron just might be entering the world of Wonder Woman after all.  After scheduling issues made the actress turn down a role in the DC Extended Universe film, it appears that she's very open to appearing in Wonder Woman 2. During a panel at last month's San Diego Comic-Con, Theron addressed the possibility of reuniting with Wonder Woman director Patty Jenkins - who previously teamed up with the actress in Monster.  ""Look I would love to work with her again."" Theron revealed. ""I had such an incredible time. I trusted her from the first time I met her. That’s a big thing for an actor, to be able to trust your director that way and she just never disappointed. She’s incredible so to see her have this moment, I just feel incredibly happy for her."" Considering the success of 2003's Monster - which earned Theron a Best Actress Oscar - a reunion between the two in Wonder Woman 2 feels like a no-brainer. While nothing is currently confirmed, Jenkins appears to agree, judging by a letter Theron was given at the SDCC panel.  ""Getting to work with Charlize and what we did together will always be remembered as a great high point of my life."" Jenkins explained. ""She’s a tremendous person, talent, artist, and actor, but also a wonderful and incredibly unique spirit who brings that dynamism to every part she plays. She’s hard, yet soft, tough, yet yielding. It was a wonderful and rare gift and I can’t wait to work with my friend again one day."" Ultimately, time will tell if Theron is officially cast in Wonder Woman 2. But it's definitely worth noting that both she and Jenkins are on board with the idea.  Wonder Woman has an 86.52 ComicBook.com Composite Score and a 4.33 out of 5 ComicBook.com User Rating, making it the fourth-highest ranked comic book movie of all time among ComicBook.com readers. Let us know what you think of Wonder Woman by giving the movie your own personal ComicBook.com User Rating below. In Wonder Woman, before she was Wonder Woman (Gal Gadot), she was Diana, princess of the Amazons, trained to be an unconquerable warrior. Raised on a sheltered island paradise, Diana meets an American pilot (Chris Pine) who tells her about the massive conflict that's raging in the outside world. Convinced that she can stop the threat, Diana leaves her home for the first time. Fighting alongside men in a war to end all wars, she finally discovers her full powers and true destiny.

This meme — the notion that in 2016 actor Denzel Washington publicly supported then-presidential candidate Donald Trump — is an example of a false claim that has evolved over time as it has spread across social media and on a variety of unreliable websites. Other iterations of this rumor falsely quoted Washington as saying that when Hillary Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election, “we avoided a war with Russia, and we avoided the creation of an Orwellian police state.”  This rumor first went viral in the final weeks of the 2016 presidential campaign. It resurfaced in February 2018 when Washington was nominated for an Oscar — and appeared yet again in April 2018, after musician Kanye West tweeted a statement of support for Trump, reigniting longstanding discussions about the political loyalties of black American voters.  Insight: Viral rumors often recirculate when new contexts for them emerge.  What can we learn?  Let’s start with an instance of this viral meme that was included in a post on a highly suspect website — USALibertyPress.com — in February 2018:  Note: The link in the previous paragraph is to an archive of the “fake news” website. That avoids linking to the site itself and giving it additional web traffic and ad revenue.  The first step we should take is to do a little lateral reading on the claim itself. So let’s do a quick search:  All the top results for this search are from fact-checking organizations, so we can safely assume that this is a questionable claim. A quick read of the fact checks confirms that the claims in both the headline and the meme on the Liberty Press website are false. PolitiFact traced the headline claim to a well-known “fake news” website, YourNewsWire.com, and Snopes shows that the quote attributed to Washington was actually said by Charles Evers, the brother of slain civil rights leader Medgar Evers, in an interview with the New York Post.  Note: Like pieces of quality journalism, good fact checks and debunking articles are transparent. They don’t ask you to trust them; they show you why you should trust them.  But this still leaves us with questions about the source of the information. The source we started with is USALibertyPress.com, so let’s begin there.  Since the site does not have an “About” section — a red flag in itself — we can try to see who might have established it by searching the WHOIS registry, a database of website registration information.  Tool: WHOIS is a database of website domain registration information that you can search using any number of free portals, such as whois.net and GoDaddy’s WHOIS search portal.  A quick search for “USALibertyPress.com” on GoDaddy’s WHOIS search portal gave us this*:  As the highlighted areas show, this site was registered by someone at an address in Veles, Macedonia — a hub for “fake news” purveyors. A quick search for Veles confirms its infamy:  We now have all we need to confirm that not only is this a false claim, but at least one website pushing it is part of a network of “fake news” sites based in Macedonia.  Finally, you could use Google Street View to see the physical address in Veles that was used to register this site:  There is quite a bit more you could do with this example — see this tweet thread for more ideas — but these three steps (reading laterally for additional information, searching the WHOIS registry for a website’s origin and using Google Street View to check out the location) are important skills that will help you sort fact from fiction in the future.  *UPDATE (Aug. 28, 2018): The domain registration for www.usalibertypress.com was updated on July 28, 2018, and no longer includes information about the registrant in Macedonia. The site itself is now offline.	0
"'Dancing With the Stars': First perfect score of the season, plus emotional elimination  Spoiler alert: This story contains significant details from Monday's ""Dancing With the Stars"" results show.  The night proved to be memorable indeed for one contestant on ""Dancing With the Stars.""  The ballroom transformed into a time machine Monday to pay tribute to a memorable year in each contestant's life, resulting in many tear-jerking moments.  However, Juan Pablo Di Pace had a reason to celebrate. He earned the season's first perfect score.  Di Pace commemorated the year he left Buenos Aires to follow his artistic abilities in the United States. The ""Grease"" actor revealed he fled because of bullying and found his life-long passion as a result.  ""Argentina wasn't the happiest place for me. I was heavily bullied in school,"" he said. ""I was called all kinds of things under the sun. I was beaten up and spat on, all that because I was a little different ... awkward ... artistic.""  Related: 'Dancing With the Stars': Nancy McKeon fractures foot ahead of NYC tribute night  The actor chose to celebrate how far he's come with a fiery samba to “Ni Tu Ni Yo” by Jennifer Lopez featuring Gente de Zona, alongside pro partner Cheryl Burke. Di Pace's performance was certainly celebrated by the audience and judges, even earning a rare standing ovation from Len Goodman.  Bruno Tonioli said,""This is one of the best sambas I have ever seen,” while Carrie Ann Inaba raved, “That samba was off the charts.”  Following the emotional performances, co-hosts Tom Bergeron and Erin Andrews revealed two couples in danger of going home: Nancy McKeon and pro Val Chmerkovskiy and Tinashe and pro Brandon Armstrong.  Ultimately, McKeon was given her walking papers – on the foot she broke before last week's competition.  McKeon and Chmerkovskiy performed a rumba, in tribute to the year her family was complete, to Lukas Graham's “Love Someone."" The pair earned a 22 out of 30.

The latest development in the push to express strength among women and solidarity in the wake of the #MeToo movement comes in the form of a classic symbol: a white rose.  White has long been associated with the fight for women’s equality, going back to the days of the suffragettes. Now attendees of the 2018 Grammy Awards are mobilizing to wear white roses to the ceremony as a way of recognizing the ongoing cultural reckoning with sexual harassment and abuse occurring across several industries, including entertainment.  Industry marketer Meg Harkins and promoter Karen Rait came up with the idea earlier this week, according to Billboard, at a dinner where they and other music industry insiders brainstormed ways to ensure that the #MeToo and Time’s Up movements were acknowledged at the Grammys, just like they were at the Golden Globes.  After they had chosen the white rose — which they settled on as a symbol of peace, hope, and resistance — they began to spread the word by way of a mass email from Atlantic Records chair Julie Greenwald. Celebrities who’ve confirmed they’ll be wearing white roses to the Grammys include Halsey, Kelly Clarkson, Cyndi Lauper, and Rita Ora, among others on a list that reportedly numbers in the hundreds.  When informed of the movement during an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Grammys host James Corden immediately voiced support and said he’d be wearing one as well.  Harkins and Rait told Billboard they were working to coordinate their messaging with the leaders of the Time’s Up campaign, which has been generally viewed as a leveling-up of the #MeToo movement to call for action and change in Hollywood. Time’s Up also doubles as a legal fund for anyone fighting sexual harassment.  The push to extend the conversation around the movement into the Grammys is significant; so far, despite prominent actors like Casey Affleck and James Franco coming under scrutiny in the wake of a wave of sexual assault allegations throughout Hollywood, there’s been little similar pushback against prominent members of the music industry.  A few, like mogul Russell Simmons, have experienced repercussions after allegations against them. But others, like musicians R. Kelly and Chris Brown, continue to maintain successful careers despite ongoing controversy surrounding accusations of sexual assault and misconduct leveled against them.  The organizers of the plan to wear white roses to the Grammys are all too aware of this dichotomy. “We have not had the tsunami [in the music industry] that politics and Hollywood has had,” Harkins told the Associated Press on Wednesday, “but we are still women.”  The effort to extend #MeToo and Time’s Up into the music industry comes at a moment when the latter campaign is already drawing backlash for expanding its reach outside of Hollywood, even though it’s not even a month old; the campaign has been criticized for not remaining narrowly focused on Hollywood reform. But the fact that in just a few days, hundreds of women in the music industry have vowed to show solidarity with Time’s Up at the Grammys indicates that, if anything, an expansion of the movement’s reach is still desired by many.  Ensuring that the conversation remains galvanized around the Grammys, then, will be an important task for the rose wearers. Corden told the Hollywood Reporter that the topic will be a major part of the awards show — most visibly through a prominent performance by Kesha intended to spotlight the #MeToo movement.  Kesha has become an inadvertent leader in conversations about how to reform the music industry to keep sexual predators from being structurally protected, due to her long fight to win contractual and financial independence from her alleged rapist and former manager, the producer Dr. Luke. Her struggle speaks to the ongoing need for conversations around abuse and assault in the music industry as well as to the growing call for change.  “We all agreed it was really necessary,” Harkins told the AP	1
“This Is Us” solidified its stance as both an audience favorite and an awards contender, grabbing eight nominations for its sophomore season, including best drama and lead actor for its leading men, Sterling K. Brown (the reigning champ) and Milo Ventimiglia.  “This is what really matters,” joked series creator and executive producer Dan Fogelman, in an interview with Variety. “This is the stuff. Not family, not health — it’s Emmy nominations.”  But in all seriousness, Fogelman says he’s “thrilled” to be part of the awards conversation — and to be representing for broadcast, as the lone network contender in the drama race. “The goal when I sat down was to try and make something that was high quality while at the same time being accessible to regular people and not be so kind of art house, avant garde or dark that people could not access the show. So to be popular and well-regarded by fancy people is exciting because it means we’re threading a very fine needle.”  Here, he tells Variety what’s in store for season three (which is now in production), his plan for the series finale, and who he’ll be rooting for on Emmy night.  Why do you think the show is resonating so much?  I hate to break it down to a bare minimum. I think people really love the actors and I think they really love the way the actors inhabit the characters. So we don’t have, necessarily, plot lines that drive people to our television show. I think there’s a warmth to it and a tone to it and a melancholy optimism to it that obviously draws people in. But I really do think it’s these actors who are doing something that is very, very hard to do, which is they are super fun to look at while being incredibly talented actors while also being incredibly charming and funny and accessible. And so I think people turn on their television at 9:00 on Tuesday and see versions of their lives and their families and themselves. I think it’s the actors who seem to be getting it done for us.  Several of your actors were nominated — including Sterling and Milo, as well as guest actors Ron Cephas Jones and Gerald McRaney. But Mandy Moore, Chrissy Metz and Justin Hartley were overlooked. How do you assess the situation with the acting races?  I don’t understand how the whole thing works. It’s an interesting thing because when we set out to do this show, I almost never would have thought we would have been able to be allowed into this fancy conversation. But then once you’re there, you’re going, how can Mandy and Justin and Chrissy not be nominated for what they did this season? And you get sucked in a little bit. You go real quick from being grateful to being disappointed for the ones that you didn’t get. But I think our group is close enough that collectively we just feel that when any individual gets the nomination, they’re representing the larger whole. And we’re not just saying it like in a platitude kind of way. The show gets nominated. They won a SAG award last year against all these other fancy cable shows. That’s exciting stuff. So for us that’s the win. We’ve got 20 million people a week watching the show, the cast can’t walk down the street, and famous directors and writers are calling me about actors who they didn’t know a couple of years ago. And so it’s all really, really exciting.  Given the success of the show, are you surprised not to see more shows trying to copy your formula? Has broadcast learned anything from your success?  I don’t think that’s how television in any form of writing or producing really works. Our show is very hard to do. It’s deceptively hard. And so, just because you’re trying to do something with emotion or multiple characters doesn’t mean it’s that simple. When we made this show, one of the things people would say was, “I liked the script but these shows don’t work. They don’t draw in mass audiences, they don’t get high ratings.” And we did it anyway. And so I’m a believer that when something hits, it can be good to go in the complete opposite di	1
They went back… back to the beginning. Mutual friends and birthdays were to thank the night NFL player Larry English met model Nicole Williams back in 2011. Though production cameras weren’t around back then, the couple’s relationship subsequently unfolded in the public eye on E!’s WAGS, including their May 2016 engagement in Thailand. A year later, they married before 220 loved ones in Laguna Beach, California.  “I was so happy and relieved,” Williams, a model, tells The Knot. “I was so nervous walking down that aisle I couldn’t feel my legs… After months of planning and work, I could finally just enjoy the rest of the night.”  The bride and groom, a retired NFL linebacker, thankfully tasked wedding planner Alissa Hussey with the finer details. “I actually couldn’t have done it without her. Planning a wedding is so much harder then I would have ever thought,” Williams notes. “So much work goes into it. So many vendors and so many decisions have to be made. Having someone who knows how everything is supposed to flow really helped ease my stress.”  The pre-wedding anxiety actually bubbled over to when she slept. “I kept dreaming that I would arrive to the wedding and the whole venue was all pink and purple flowers. I’d wake up sweating,” she jokes. “Flowers are the most important part of your wedding, so I literally would go to bed thinking about flowers and have nightmares that nothing would be beautiful… I had nothing to worry about and I was in great hands.”  That doesn’t mean that the day went by without any snafus. “One of my bridesmaids broke the zipper on her dress,” Williams laughs. “She had to be stitched in.”  In retrospect, the bride would tell herself to actually embrace each and every minute of the day. “I would tell her to enjoy every moment because it goes by so fast,” she says. “I was told the same thing, even so, I still got a bit overwhelmed with saying hi to everyone, changing dresses, and being pulled in every direction for different things. Oh and take a moment for yourself to take everything in.”  The Venue  The couple exchanged vows at the Montage in Laguna Beach. “Our ceremony was set at the most perfect of locations, overlooking the Pacific Ocean,” Williams says. “Larry and I were framed together by a beautiful white and green floral arch that had roses and cascading orchids. Our aisle was aligned with black planter boxes filled with white flowers and even more tall floral arrangements at the entrance of the aisle.”  The Dress  The bride wore a custom design by Michael Costello. The piece, comprised of lace and hand-beaded detail, included a high neck design and open back. “It was my dream dress,” says the bride.  The Ceremony  The couple’s two nieces—one on each side—and goddaughter all served as flower girls in the wedding. The bride was escorted down the aisle by both her mom and dad to the tune of Celine Dion’s “The Power of Love.” (“It’s always been a special song to me,” she says.)  “We actually just kept our ceremony very short and simple. I didn’t want to stand up there too long because I get so nervous in front of crowds!” Williams says. “You wouldn’t believe how weak my knees get.”  The Planner  Los Angeles-based event planner Alissa Hussey of Alissa Hussey Productions was a huge help to the couple. “Having a big wedding like we did was definitely hard to pull off alone, so Alissa really made it happen for us,” Williams says.  The Decor  The pair opted for a white-and-black color reception. “We draped the ballroom in all white to create a crisp palette,” she says. “We chose black, sparkly table linens and a huge white dance floor with our initials in black.” To offset the neutral colors, Hussey added elements of sparkle with giant chandeliers over the dance floor. Adding to the luxe factor, the couple served meals on marble-canted chargers accented with rose-gold silverware.  “The flowers were to die for,” Williams continues. “Avant Garden did huge tall round centerpieces of white orchards and	1

In 2018, NPR ranked this as the #94 greatest song by a female or nonbinary artist in the 21st century, saying:  2001 was a great year for pop music, especially the pop collaboration. Jennifer Lopez and Ja Rule gave us the ‘I’m Real (Remix),’ and ‘Lady Marmalade’ received an epic reimagining from Christina Aguilera, Lil' Kim, P!nk, Mya (and Missy Elliot) on the Moulin Rouge soundtrack. But above it all, The Ruff Ryders' first lady and Rolling Stone’s newly-minted ‘Queen of Confessional Pop’ held court with the release of ‘Let Me Blow Ya Mind,’ the deftly cool, swagged-out single from Eve’s sophomore album, Scorpion. An instant classic, the track peaked at No. 2 on the Billboard Hot 100 and earned the pair the inaugural Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. Almost 20 years later, the collaboration can still blow ya mind.	1
"Niall Horan and Maren Morris attend the 51st annual CMA Awards at the Bridgestone Arena on Nov. 8, 2017 in Nashville, Tenn.  Maren Morris got engaged to fellow country singer-songwriter Ryan Hurd in July and now the couple has finally set a wedding date. In an interview with E! News, the country star announced that they’re tying the knot on March 24.  “I feel like all the corners are knocked out,” said Morris. “We’ve got the location, the date, the guest list -- kind of -- and I’ve got the groom! So, that’s the most important part.”  How about the band? ""Niall's performing!"" Morris teased, meaning Niall Horan, with whom she collaborated on the song “Seeing Blind” off his new album, Flicker.  Whether Horan will actually make the joke a reality remains to be seen, but lucky guests will be able to enjoy from the couple’s margarita bar, oyster bar and even an appearance by Morris’ adorable dog, June.  The wedding planning, though quick, has been very relaxed so far, according to Morris. “I’m not like a very stuffy person, and I actually get really bored just sitting down for hours and hours,” she said."	1
Keri Russell is headed to a galaxy far, far away.  Sources tell Variety that the “Felicity” alum is in early talks to join J.J. Abrams’ “Star Wars: Episode IX,” which Abrams is writing and directing. Russell and Abrams last collaborated on 2006’s “Mission: Impossible III.”  The role calls for action-heavy fight scenes. Russell has shown her ability to perform tough stunts in projects like FX’s “The Americans,” “Mission: Impossible,” and “Dawn of the Planet of the Apes.”  Abrams and Lucasfilm execs met with several actresses for the role in the past two months and settled on Russell right before the Fourth of July holiday. Abrams will likely cast two more actors by the time the film begins production at the end of the month. Daisy Ridley, John Boyega, Oscar Isaac, and Adam Driver are all expected to return.  Abrams helmed “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” and was asked to come back to direct this latest installment after Colin Trevorrow exited following creative differences. Abrams filled the role last fall and has spent most of that time working on the script with Chris Terrio.  It’s unknown at this time whether Russell will be on the side of the rebels or the evil empire.  Russell recently wrapped the final season of “The Americans.” She is repped by WME and manager Joannie Burstein.	1

Watch Entertainment Tonight on Yahoo View.  Music’s odd couple, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton — aka the rocker and the country boy — have never been free of gossip speculating about their relationship. Apparently, the latest news is that the two are through. In Touch Weekly reports that Shelton actually unceremoniously dumped Stefani in February before embarking on a tour.  But wait — if that’s the case, then why is Stefani appearing with him on stage? And not just appearing … they’re appearing pretty cuddly. The singer posted an Instagram shot on Mar. 14 of the two embracing on what appears to be the most recent date of his “Country Music Freaks” trek.      This isn’t the first such picture she has shared since February. She posted several different angles of a jumbotron kiss on Feb. 25, and on March 11, one of herself hanging out with country up-and-comer Carly Pearce, who is an opener on Shelton’s tour, and another that shows off a backstage crowd (including Shelton and her younger brother Todd) in Greensboro, N.C.      Additionally, she sent good wishes to him on Mar. 1 — when Shelton was reportedly attempting to power through a Houston date while sick with the flu — and shared his latest video, “I Lived It” with a glowing string of hashtags.      So if the breakup is fake news, what spurred the rumors? According to In Touch‘s “insider” source, all of Stefani’s social media support is “a desperate attempt to ignore the truth,” and Shelton dumped her due to her “neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband, and her jealousy of him and other women.”  If this is to be believed, current Voice champion Chloe Kohanski was a factor in the breakup — Coach Shelton was apparently getting too close for Stefani’s comfort — as well as Shelton’s ex-wife Miranda Lambert, with whom the outlet claims he has rekindled a friendship and is “sharing intimate details” of his life.  Shelton isn’t reciprocating Stefani’s loving social media deluge — but then again, he’s never been one to do so. His social media accounts, once a source of ribald jokes, have developed gradually into a more businesslike platform to market his music and work on The Voice. He does, however, maintain a picture of Stefani as his profile photo.  Read more from Yahoo Entertainment:	0

Sophie Turner’s engagement ring is definitely fit for a queen. The young Game of Thrones starlet prepares to join house Jonas, and took to Instagram to spread the word.  Sophie and fiancé Joe Jonas raced each other to social media, posting the same sweet photo of their two hands, with Sophie sporting a dazzling diamond engagement ring. The bride-to-be captioned the pic with, “I said yes,”, while Jonas echoed the sentiment, writing, “She said yes!”  The starstruck couple was first introduced in 2016 by mutual friend Hailee Steinfeld who met Sophie on the set of Barely Legal, and Joe during collaboration with his band DNCE. The relationship began right away but the couple did not officially confirm it until the HBO after-party for the Golden Globes in January of 2017.  No news yet about the date of the much anticipated wedding, but we do know that sisterly co-star Maisie Williams will in fact be a bridesmaid.

What style setting is Sophie Turner’s engagement ring?  Sophie Turner’s engagement ring is a solitaire pear-cut diamond set on a double pavé band, in white gold.

The #MeToo reckoning is continuing to slowly engulf R. Kelly. In January, Lifetime premiered the documentary series Surviving R. Kelly, an overview of Kelly’s life and career — and of the decades’ worth of accounts that accuse him of having sexually abused young women and children. (Kelly’s lawyer has said the series is full of lies and has threatened to sue.)  In February, Kelly was officially charged with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse against four victims, at least three of them minors. And in May, Kelly was charged with 11 more counts, including the far more serious charge of aggravated criminal sexual assault.  Now, Kelly faces 18 new counts, including kidnapping and child pornography.  Kelly has been accused of sexual relationships with minors going back to 1994, when he married 15-year-old pop star Aaliyah. (The marriage was annulled.) In the 25 years since then, he has been sued multiple times for inappropriate sexual contact with a minor (he settled out of court every time), and he was eventually charged with creating child pornography. (A jury found him not guilty on the grounds that they could not conclusively identify the other figure in his infamous sex tape as a child.)  In 2017, he was accused of creating an abusive “sex cult” of very young women, whom he allegedly isolates, brainwashes, and abuses physically and emotionally. Since the story broke, multiple women have added their own testimonies of abuse at R. Kelly’s hands, including his ex-wife. (Through a lawyer, Kelly has denied all accusations, saying he would “work diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name.”)  Yet despite decades of lawsuits and allegations, Kelly’s career marched steadily on. In 2017, he finished an arena tour with a few cancellations. In 2018, he toured with singer Charlie Wilson (there were some protests). His music appeared in Pitch Perfect 3.  At Coachella in 2018, rapper Vince Staples repeatedly referred to Kelly as a “child molester” in an interview with Complex. And in our post-#MeToo, post-Time’s Up, post-Harvey Weinstein world, and given the sheer volume of allegations against Kelly, it seems reasonable to raise the question of why he’s been able to continue working so much. But Staples’s interviewer only giggled nervously and protested, “We can’t ever talk about this guy. ... You’re about to get me fired from Coachella. It’s my first time here.” Later, Staples tweeted that “R. Kelly people is looking for me.”  ladies and gentlemen, vince staples on r kelly pic.twitter.com/SmZdYu9PNJ — andy (@aboynamedandy) April 16, 2018  That stasis appears to be changing. Most of the claims against Kelly were reiterated in a 2018 BBC Three documentary, R Kelly: Sex, Girls & Videotapes, and then again in Lifetime’s Surviving R. Kelly. And over the past two years, at least five members of Kelly’s inner circle have left him. His assistant, his accountant, his lawyer, and his rep have all said that they no longer work for him, although none of them have gone into detail about their departures and all have been supportive and complimentary toward Kelly in their statements. His longtime musical accompanist, DJ Phantom, was less circumspect about his decision to leave Kelly in 2017: “I didn’t know then what I know now,” he said. “He’s a shitbag.”  Last spring, the Women of Color committee within Time’s Up threw its weight behind the #MuteRKelly campaign, calling for anyone currently profiting from Kelly and his music to drop him, including Spotify, Ticketmaster, and Kelly’s record label, RCA. In January, RCA quietly dropped Kelly.  And now, Kelly has been officially charged with more than a dozen counts of sexual abuse and assault.  It’s possible that these latest developments mean that he’s about to face lasting consequences for those accusations. But if that’s the case, those consequences took more than two decades to reach him.  And despite everything, it’s still possible that Kelly will continue on with his 	0
"Can music fans expect an amazing ""Starboy""/""Swish Swish"" mashup sometime soon? Katy Perry and The Weeknd recently had dinner together, according to multiple sources. But since the two singers are both currently single — with Perry's breakup from Orlando Bloom and The Weeknd recently splitting from Selena Gomez — could this dinner date be a sign of anything more than a friendship or a possible collaboration going on between the two?  Sources including Glamour UK and Vogue, reported that the two singers had a fashionable dinner date. According to The Sun's report, Perry and The Weeknd, aka Abel Tesfaye, dined together in West Hollywood and apparently had a great time with each other. They then reportedly went home separately. The Sun's report suggests that the date between the pair was romantic and not just a dinner between friends, but take that with a grain of salt. Not only are there are no details available from the singers themselves, but other publications are reporting that they simply got dinner, no romance involved.  While many sources have reported on this dinner between Perry and The Weeknd, most outlets have yet to report anything regarding a potential relationship between the pair. Sorry to burst the bubble of any Katy Perry and The Weeknd shippers, but it's probably just a rumor that the two are dating — at least right now.  Christopher Polk/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  The Weeknd has found himself linked to a couple of different women after his breakup with Gomez, and it's not likely that he's actually dating every single person he'e seen with. On Nov. 11, Us Weekly reported that he was seen holding hands with Yovanna Ventura, who was previously linked to Justin Bieber, who is currently dating his ex-girlfriend (and The Weeknd's ex-girlfriend, for that matter) Gomez. According to an Us Weekly source, ""[The Weeknd] was trying to make it obvious that he was with someone. They were pretty affectionate and were together the whole night.""  There were also reports that The Weeknd was back in contact with his ex-girlfriend Bella Hadid. Although they reportedly haven't gotten back together romantically, People reported on Nov. 17 that ""He is talking to Bella a lot and they've hung out too."" The Weeknd and Hadid apparently ""still love each other"" and are seeing where things go with them, according to E!. It was also reported by Hollywood Life that he sent Hadid flowers before the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show ""with a sweet note"". The abundance of rumors surrounding The Weeknd's love life, show that romance rumors might be quick to catch-on whenever he's seen hanging out with anyone, as in the case with Perry.  Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images  Romance rumors surrounding the ""Starboy"" singer have been abundant ever since he and fellow singer Gomez were reported to have broken up. According to E!, the two singers dated for 10 months before they called it quits in late October. The split was reportedly amicable and it had nothing to do with Gomez hanging out with her ex. A source said, ""The relationship was basically over before Justin Bieber and Selena hung out."" It wasn't long after those two lovebirds' reunion hit the headlines. But, since it doesn't sound as though there wasn't any bad blood with that breakup, it's likely that The Weeknd is just focusing on doing his own thing.  Does his own thing involve Katy Perry? Probably not in a romantic way. Until the two singers confirm anything about a potential relationship, it's more likely that they are just two friends hanging out and possibly making some fans' pop dreams come true."	0
Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez have remained friends for years despite the media spotlight that causes some celebrity relationships to splinter. After watching her friend go through heartbreak from the ups and downs that occurred in her romance with Justin Bieber, Taylor is definitely not a Belieber. With the “Sorry” singer aware that Swift dislikes him, Justin is blaming Taylor for the most recent crumbling of Jelena, according to Hollywood Life’s insider.  However, don’t look for any signs on social media or in interviews that the Biebs blames Swift.  “Justin knows Taylor doesn’t like him and never will and the feeling is mutual, but he is smart enough to know not to say anything in public or on social media because he knows all the scrutiny he’d endure,” explained the source.  Taylor Swift and Selena Gomez showcase their friendship. [Photo by Jason Kempin/Getty Images for iHeartRadio / Turner]  Swift recently attracted attention at the iHeartRadio Awards by throwing shade at the 22-year-old pop star after his performance, pointedly looking in the opposite direction. And the Biebs doesn’t believe that he and Taylor will ever become pals. In contrast, he will always blame Swift for any problems in his Jelena relationship, claims the insider.  “He never expects to be her friend and is not looking to be her friend. He blames Taylor for some of his issues with Selena and that will never go away.”  Is Taylor Swift to blame for separating Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber?

Amid the blame game controversy that resulted, sources told Naughty Gossip that Gomez was the one who was “aggressive” to hurt Katy.  “Selena really likes him and was very aggressive to get him,” claimed one source. “You must remember that her best friend is Taylor Swift who hates Katy Perry. I can only imagine the things Taylor and Selena have said to each other about Katy.”  As to whether Swift actually orchestrated the hookup to make Perry feel bad, however?  “I doubt Taylor was behind this hookup, but you know these two have spoken about it since,” added the insider.  Katy Perry tweeted her views about the alleged cheating scandal involving Selena Gomez and Orlando Bloom. [Photo by Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images]  Taking it one step further, Wendy Williams used her talk show as a platform to claim that Swift pushed her pal to get intimate with Orlando, an allegation that Gossip Cop calls false.  “Selena is best friends with Taylor Swift. And Taylor is [a] low-key mean girl, doesn’t want to see anybody get anything,” slammed Wendy. “Katy, you need to be looking at your man…sicced on him by Taylor Swift. Taylor is just a [b***h].”  However, when it comes to Swift and the allegations of cheating, Taylor was never involved, according to Gossip Cop.  As for how Katy feels about this situation? Perry is dealing with it by turning to Twitter to challenge all those allegations, pointed out Vanity Fair.  Is that all there is? https://t.co/54Q72MfXND — KATY PERRY (@katyperry) May 12, 2016  Loading...  Using social media to showcase her views, Katy tweeted a link to Peggy Lee’s song, “Is That All There Is?” and followed it with a link to an article about Bloom’s efforts as a UNICEF goodwill ambassador in Eastern Ukraine.  “Instead of giving energy & eyeballs to dumb conspiracy, check out how cool this is,” urged Perry. “#dontfeedthebeast.”  Instead of giving energy & eyeballs to dumb conspiracy ???? check out how C????????L this is: https://t.co/ClmGlPMz3x #dontfeedthebeast — KATY PERRY (@katyperry) May 12, 2016  Providing her own view on the situation, Gomez retweeted what Katy had posted, complete with a prayer hands emoji.

Chadwick Boseman and Lupita Nyong’o star in Marvel’s Black Panther (in theaters now.) Boseman plays King T’Challa and Lupita plays his off-and-on girlfriend Nakia, and they have chemistry on screen. Nyong’o credits director Ryan Coogler with that visible chemistry, saying Boseman himself is a “magnetic person.” She adds, “Chemistry is something that you pray for as an actor, because it’s so hard to fabricate. It’s so much easier to just have it and work on other things– your intention, your action, and all that. To try and fabricate chemistry is another… it’s a lot of energy.” Boseman added that while they’re not dating in real life, “It’s not hard to fall in love with Lupita. She’s a beautiful person. She’s intelligent, strong, assertive. You fall in love with people when you see them in their light, when you see them doing what they do, and they illuminate a certain aura.  Also On Majic 102.1:	1

The 41-year-old Oscar winner (and younger brother of Ben Affleck) and 38-year-old actress Summer (the younger sister of Joaquin and the late River Phoenix) split in 2015.  However it was only on Monday that Summer officially filed for divorce from her husband.  According to E! News, Summer has cited “irreconcilable differences” as the reason for wanting a divorce.  (Image: Getty Images North America) (Image: PA)  The news comes two years after the couple separated - although they only made their separation public in 2016.  Summer and Casey have two sons together - 13-year-old Indiana and nine-year-old Atticus.  The soon-to-be-ex-husband and wife originally began dating back in 1999 - when Summer was in a relationship with someone else, but her brother Joaquin encouraged Casey to pursue her.  (Image: Splash News)  ""She was going out with someone else and I said, 'Man, she's cute,' and [Joaquin] said, 'You should see if she'll go out with you… don't worry about that dude,’” Casey told The Daily Beast in 2013.  The pair tied-the-knot in 2006 - and had performed together in the 2000 film Committed and a 2002 stage production of This Is Our Youth.  Since October 2016, Casey has been in a relationship with actress Floriana Lima, 36."	0
The 2018 Golden Globe Acting Nominees in Photos    1 / 70 Chevron Chevron Courtesy of Focus Features. Nominated for Best Actor, Drama Gary Oldman, Darkest Hour  The nominations for the 2018 Golden Globe Awards were announced at the Beverly Hilton Hotel by Alfre Woodard, Garrett Hedlund, Kristen Bell, and Sharon Stone on Monday morning—and as ever, the slate was full of surprises. The Shape of Water led the pack with seven nominations, including nods for best picture, director, and actress, all in the drama category. It was followed closely by The Post and Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, two more dramas that picked up a respectable six nominations apiece. In the comedy categories, Lady Bird reigned supreme with four nods, although it may face stiff competition from I, Tonya—which got three—and The Greatest Showman, the upcoming P.T. Barnum musical starring Hugh Jackman.  The biggest shock in the film categories, however, were the three nods given to All the Money in the World, a Ridley Scott film that underwent hasty reshoots and edits this fall after Scott decided to replace star Kevin Spacey with Christopher Plummer, following a series of accusations of sexual misconduct against Spacey. The movie has not yet screened for critics—but evidently, the Hollywood Foreign Press Association has seen it, and liked it well enough to cite it for best director, actress (Michelle Williams), and supporting actor (Plummer).  On the television side of the aisle, Big Little Lies—of course—got the most nominations, scoring six total nods. The Handmaid’s Tale—which, like Big Little Lies, recently won big at the Emmys—was tied for most-decorated drama with This Is Us; each earned three nominations. Meanwhile, few comedies stood out from the pack; several series were give two nominations each, including Globes favorite Black-ish, Amazon’s brand-new stunner The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Aziz Ansari’s Netflix gem Master of None, the new Showtime hit SMILF, and NBC’s well-liked revival of Will & Grace.  Below, find a full list of nominees. The Globes, hosted by Seth Meyers, air January 7 on NBC.  Film  Best Motion Picture, Drama	1

"The 2018 show will broadcast live on ABC on Oct. 9.  If you thought last year's American Music Awards were hilarious, you're in luck: Tracee Ellis Ross is coming back for a second year as the awards show's host. The black-ish star will return as the night's emcee as well as an executive producer for the 2018 American Music Awards, which will broadcast live from the Microsoft Theater in Los Angeles on Oct. 9.  ""SO NICE, I’M DOING IT TWICE,"" Ross captioned an Instagram post revealing the news, which reminds fans just how sassy and silly -- and fashionable -- she was on last year's show.  Ross' role as host at the 2017 AMAs made the show a family affair, as her mother, Diana Ross, received the lifetime achievement award. Though the same kind of family ties aren't happening this year, Ross' hosting gig is still timely: The fifth season of black-ish premieres a week after this year's American Music Awards on Oct. 16.​  Nominations for the 2018 American Music Awards are set to be announced on Sept. 12, with Kane Brown, Ella Mai, Normani and Bebe Rexha unveiling the list live from YouTube Space LA in Los Angeles. The 2018 AMAs air Oct. 9 at 8:00 p.m. ET on ABC.  Check out Ross' hosting announcement below.  They've created chart-topping hits with Nelly, The Chainsmokers and the Backstreet Boys, but when it came to Florida Georgia Line's latest collaboration, it took Tyler Hubbard's wife to get the track rolling. The country duo feature on Bebe Rexha's latest single, ""Meant to Be,"" from her EP All Your Fault: Pt. 2, and the trio shared how the unexpected writing session was fueled from encouraging words of wisdom from Hubbard's pregnant wife, Hayley.  ""It was my second session of the day and their second session of the day, and they were kind of over it and so was I,"" Rexha tells Billboard during an exclusive interview after performing the track at an AMAs encore performance for Xfinity TV subscribers. ""Tyler and I sat down, and he was like, 'You know what my just wife told me? She said, 'If it's meant to be, it'll be that we write a hit or not.' And, I said, 'Well that's the song -- let's go!' Then the song just poured out.""  Having worked with everyone from Lil Wayne and 2 Chainz to Martin Garrix and One Direction's Louis Tomlinson, Rexha prides herself in being a ""renegade"" with no genre boundaries, so needed little convincing when her manager suggested she explore the country world and ""vibe out"" with Florida Georgia Line. And, after the duo's scheduled writing partner pulled out one night, the collaboration was simply ""meant to be.""  ""We were supposed to write with somebody else, and it fell through, and she happened to be available, so it was an unexpected write and a pretty special night,"" Hubbard says. ""When songs like this get written, it's pretty magical -- everybody feels like we're onto something big. We all fell in love with it, then Bebe decided she wanted to release it and have us feature, which was a huge honor. One thing lead to another and that's what's special thing about this song -- it's been super organic and nothing's been forced.""  Rexha admits she was incredibly nervous about her first foray into the genre, and held misconceived perceptions about the lyrics and writing style of country artists. Sitting down with Hubbard, she was surprised at how well the pair ""bled"" into each other's songwriting styles, and put their twist on each other's verses.  What she didn't expect was that the feel-good ballad would help her through her own trouble.  ""I've recently been going through heartbreak, and I listen to the song, and it makes me feel better and like there's some type of destiny and if something doesn't work out then, there's something better waiting for you,"" she says. ""I think that's something we need more than ever with all the events going on in the world. People want to feel safe and like everything's going to be OK.""  The AMAs encore performance can now be seen exclusively on Xfinity on Demand for Xfinity TV "	1

Kim Zolciak-Biermann knows the tea, but that doesn’t mean she’s ready to spill….yet.  During an appearance on E!’s Daily Pop was asked about her recent tweet that alluded to one of her Real Housewives of Atlanta co-stars being fired.  Kim clarified that now infamous “Poof! #LostYourPeach,” tweet, which was geared toward co-star Kenya Moore, who has been fighting firing rumors for months.  But for now, Kim’s keeping her lips sealed while still alluding that Kenya has lost her peach for good. Sometimes saying nothing or very little speaks volumes.  “I will get in so much trouble if I tell you. Nope. I cannot tell you! You’ll have to wait and see next year,” Kim said about her infamous tweet. “People think I just say it because I’m being a hater, but I’m just telling you that it’s true.”  However, Kenya has publicly denied rumors that she has been fired; claiming that she’s one of the “most relevant” Housewives on the Real Housewives of Atlanta.  “I think my storyline speaks for itself, the fact that I’m one of the most Google’d people on the show and, one might say, one of the most relevant,” Kenya told E! News. “I don’t think that anyone would rush to a judgment to say I wouldn’t be a Housewife. I have the top storyline of the entire season, so that wouldn’t even really make good business sense.”  I have a sneaky suspicion that Kenya may be getting the ax, but part of me is pissed about it because I feel like Kim is getting her way. I’d be curious to know if Kim could have played a role in Kenya getting let go if the rumors are true.  Do you think Kenya had been fired from RHOA? Is Kenya one of the most relevant Housewives on the show? Why do you think Kim is all the sudden keeping her mouth shut? Could Kim be behind Kenya’s firing? Would you rather have Kim or Kenya on RHOA?  Follow AllAboutTRH On Instagram.  Follow AllAboutTRH On Twitter.  Like AllAboutTRH On Facebook.

A moment 11 years in the making…  The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills may have just delivered the most awkward and savage reunion exchange ever.  In part two of the RHOBH season 7 reunion, Kim Richards joins the drama to address her continued beef with Lisa Rinna and newbie Eden Sassoon.  You might remember that Lisa and Kim’s drama this season began when Rinna said she feared Kim was near death then claimed she forgot that the conversation ever happened. In the end, Rinna’s comments got back to Kim and her sister Kyle Richards causing the drama between the three to explode.  When Kim arrives at the reunion – she’s not alone and has brought the stuffed bunny Rinna gave her for her newborn grandson.  “I brought the bunny,” Kim reveals, “because I never gave it to my grandson. Cause it didn’t feel like it had good energy.”  The moment shocks the entire RHOBH cast and looks on everybody’s faces says it all.  “I’m sorry,” Kim tells a teary-eyed Lisa. “So, I think what I should do is give it to you, and when you are in a better place, maybe you can give it back to me because right now I don’t feel like it was given to me with the right energy.”  Throughout the exchange, Kyle nervously bites her nails as Rinna is stunned by Kim’s words.  Eden then interjects asking Kim, “Would you like one of my crystals? Maybe it’ll help heal you?”  “Nope, I’m healed,” Kim quickly shoots back. “I’m good,” Kim adds as the behind the scenes crew bursts out in laughter.  Kim’s actions obviously have hurt Rinna as a tear falls from her face.  “You don’t have to cry over it,” Kim tells Rinna.  Then Lisa Vanderpump chimes in to try and show everyone the hope and positivity in Kim’s words. Kim admits she could have regifted the bunny but instead gave it back to Rinna.  “Rinna, she’s still saying there’s hope for the future between the two of you,” LVP explains.  However, Eileen Davidson sees it differently telling LVP, “What do you think returning the bunny at the reunion means? Send it in the mail.”  To wrap up, reunion host Andy Cohen asks a crying and hurt Rinna what she thinks of this.  Watch the clip below to see the drama unfold and find out what Rinna has to say!  I’m calling one of the season 8 storylines now – Kim and Rinna reconcile, and Rinna gives Kim back the bunny. Kim, Rinna, and Eden’s showdown at the reunion will be epic especially considering all they have to hash out.  Thoughts on the reunion preview? Can you believe Kim gave Rinna back the bunny? Do you think Kim and Rinna will reconcile eventually? Did Rinna’s bunny gift have bad intentions/energy attached to it? Why do you think Eden feels Kim isn’t healed?

At the time of his death, The Dark Knight was in its editing-phase, and The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus was in the midst of filming, in which he was playing his last role as Tony.

Just a rumor Billie Lourd To Play Goldie Hawn In the Movie! Also rumored Kate Hudson to play the Part! Find out Share this  Lot’s of Rumor going on! Although we would want it to be true. The rumor is a movie based on Goldie Hawn’s experiences on “Laugh-In” is in development, and Billie Lourd is in talks to play her. But turns out- not a real news.  Billie Lourd rumor  There is site that has spread the rumor of actress Billie but they are not true news as they were all made up by their unspecified source and Gossip cop have exclusively looked through the news and found out it to be false. So here we go.  According to the National Enquirer, both Hawn and Amy Schumer, the stars of “Snatched,” are planning to pitch a film based on Hawn’s time on “Laugh-In,” a sketch comedy television show, with Lourd as the leading lady. A so-called “source” tells the often disproven outlet, “After pumping Goldie about her bizarre experiences on stage and backstage, Amy knew it was a no-brainer.”  The magazine’s dubious insider goes on to purport that the pair considered Kate Hudson, Hawn’s daughter, to take on the role as her “fresh-faced” mom, “but Kate will be 40 before cameras can start rolling.” Instead, “they’re now set to sign Carrie Fisher’s gorgeous daughter, Billie Lourd, who’s already at stardom’s door after signing on to the new ‘Star Wars,’” concludes the tipster.  But Gossip Cop investigated into the Enquirer’s questionable report, and a rep for Lourd assures us the entire article is “not true.” Fisher’s daughter is not in talks to play Hawn in a movie about her time on “Laugh-In,” and any claims made otherwise are simply false. The story is 100 percent made up.  Short Bio on Billie Lourd and Goldie Hawn:  California-born Billie Lourd was born as Billie Catherine Lourd on July 17, 1992.

Janelle Monáe is crying in her spacesuit. It’s early April in Atlanta, and she’s in one of the basement studios of her Wondaland Records headquarters, surrounded by computer monitors and TV screens, one of them running a screensaver that displays images of her heroes: Prince, Martin Luther King Jr., Pam Grier, Tina Turner, Lupita Nyong’o, David Bowie. She’s about to reveal, for the first time, something the world has long guessed, something her closest friends and family already know, something she’s long been loath to say in public. As she sings on a song from her new album, Dirty Computer, “Let the rumors be true.” Janelle Monáe is not, she finally admits, the immaculate android, the “alien from outer space/The cybergirl without a face” she’s claimed to be over a decade’s worth of albums, videos, concerts and even interviews – she is, instead, a flawed, messy, flesh-and-blood 32-year-old human being.  And she has another rumor to confirm. “Being a queer black woman in America,” she says, taking a breath as she comes out, “someone who has been in relationships with both men and women – I consider myself to be a free-ass motherfucker.” She initially identified as bisexual, she clarifies, “but then later I read about pansexuality and was like, ‘Oh, these are things that I identify with too.’ I’m open to learning more about who I am.”  It’s a lovely spacesuit she’s wearing, a form-fitting white NASA artifact complete with a “commander” patch on one arm and an American flag on the other. She’s put it on for no reason at all – there are no cameras in sight – as she lounges around Wondaland. The outfit is a remnant, perhaps, of the android persona, known as Cindi Mayweather, that she fed us all these years: a messianic, revolutionary robot who fell in love with a human and vowed to free the rest of the androids.  Popular on Rolling Stone  Early in her career, Monáe was insecure about living up to impossible showbiz ideals; the persona, the androgynous outfits, the inflexible commitment to the storyline both on- and offstage, served in part as protective armor. “It had to do with the fear of being judged,” she says. “All I saw was that I was supposed to look a certain way coming into this industry, and I felt like I [didn’t] look like a stereotypical black female artist.”  She is also a perfectionist, a tendency that’s helped her career and hindered her emotional life; portraying a flawless automaton was also a bit of wish fulfillment. It’s one of the many reasons she thought she had a “computer virus” that needed cleaning, which led her to years of therapy, starting before the 2010 release of her debut, The ArchAndroid. “I felt misunderstood,” she says. “I was like, ‘Before I self-destruct, before I become a confused person in front of the world, let me seek some help.’ I was afraid for anybody to see me not at the top of my game. That obsession was too much for me.”  So she overcompensated, as she puts it, leaving fans to puzzle over the sight and sound of a dark-skinned, androgynously dressed black woman creating Afro-futuristic fantasias as trippy as the Parliament-Funkadelic soundscapes she grew up hearing. She became a pop anomaly, a sometimes incongruous interloper in the universes of her earliest supporters, Big Boi and Puff Daddy, the latter having signed her to a partnership with Bad Boy Records in 2008. The ArchAndroid was a buzzy introduction, and 2013’s Electric Lady – certainly the first progged-out concept album in the history of Bad Boy – established her as one of the 21st century’s most inventive voices. Years before Frank Ocean, Solange, Beyoncé and SZA pushed arty, alternative R&B to the mainstream, Monáe was already there, bridging the gap between neo-soul and all that was to come, unafraid to fuse rock, funk, hip-hop (when she feels like it, as on her recent single “Django Jane,” she’s a top-flight rapper), R&B, electronica and campy, drama-kid theatricality.  She always ducked questions about her sexuality (“I 	1
Ever since Jennifer Aniston married Justin Theroux, pregnancy rumors have followed the couple. Something as simple as a picture of Aniston with her hand on her stomach is proof enough for some tabloids that the actress is expecting a baby. Now, a new report claims that the Friends star has hired a surrogate, could there be any truth to the story?  In the new issue of Star, the tabloid features the headline, “Jen To Justin: I’ll Raise Our Baby Alone!” followed by a story that asserts Aniston wants to become a mom, and she will do it with or without her husband. The publication claims to have a source that reveals Aniston’s marriage is “on the rocks,” and she is planning to be a single mom.  ?…❤️✌️ A post shared by @justintheroux on Aug 5, 2017 at 4:23pm PDT  “Privately, she has told friends that she’s secretly gone ahead and hired a surrogate mother to carry her child to birth. And she’s vowed to raise the baby alone,” tells the insider.  But then the source says the actress is hoping to choose the right woman soon, completely contradicting the earlier quote, which is a huge red flag that something isn’t right with this claim.  But many think the tabloid story is completely false and contradictory quotes prove the story is garbage, questioning why the insider is sharing such private and secret information with a tabloid.  This is the same magazine that published a story earlier this year claiming Aniston herself was pregnant, but then didn’t mention that at all in its latest baby claims.  Aniston told Glamour magazine back in August that not only are the pregnancy tabloid stories guilty of body shaming, but they are also an invasion into a private matter between her and her husband. She said it is no one’s business whether or not she has a baby.  Jennifer Aniston went on to say that the subject of having a baby is a sensitive topic for her, and no one has the right to judge other people’s choices.

"Coachella is the perfect place to assemble the largest and most random of squads, and that's exactly what Nicki Minaj did on day one of the annual festival. Sharing some pictures and videos from her Friday night, Nicki can be seen mingling with Kylie Jenner, Travis Scott, Kourtney Kardashian, and Quavo in one clip, with her new Young Thug collaboration ""Anybody"" blasting in the background. Most notable of this assortment of guests is Quavo, who Nicki had just aired her grievances with regarding the drama around ""Motorsport"" Thursday. As she explained today, the two have since made amends, possibly at this very event.  But back to the squads -- later on, Nicki only expanded the large assortment of famous friends she was partying with, taking a picture with The Weeknd, Nav, Belly, French Montana, and most surprisingly, Canadian country star Shania Twain. ""@shaniatwain is so dope in real life,"" she captioned the pic. On top of that, The Weeknd shared his own picture of the same gathering of familiar faces, which revealed Call Me By Your Name star Timothee Chalamet smiling at the back.  The Weeknd, of course, headlined day one of the festival. You can watch highlights from his performance, including a stripped-down take on ""Call Out Your Name,"" here.  Nicki Minaj is fresh off of dropping two brand new singles ""Chun-Li"" and ""Barbie Tingz."" Her long-awaited fourth studio album is expected later this year.

They’re notorious; they’re infamous; they’re in love–still.  Who ever thought that Heidi Montag and Spencer Pratt would be one of the most resilient marriages in Hollywood?…  from E! Online (US) – Top Stories http://ift.tt/2z6xOSw	1
With a lineup of seven or eight series currently in development or production, uber-producer Ryan Murphy has more than a full plate. But going forward, he said, he’s going to take his time making sure they’re all in ideal shape. “I’m not going to shoot anything until it’s written, and it’s perfectly cast, and I get great number twos in terms of showrunners and directors,” he told reporters at the Television Critics Assn. press tour in Pasadena.  In the era of Peak TV and streaming, he said it’s tempting to rush projects through, and Murphy — who has been on hand to present three series (“Pose,” “9-1-1” and “American Crime Story: Versace”) admitted that he wasn’t happy with the first iteration of “American Crime Story: Katrina,” which is slated as the next installment in that limited series franchise. “I still had a passion for the story, but it wasn’t the right story,” he said. “I do think there’s such a need and expectation to be constantly feeding the machine.”  The new version — which is set to star frequent Murphy collaborator Sarah Paulson and go into production in the fall — will be based on the book “Five Days at Memorial,” in partnership with producer Scott Rudin. “It’s really a look at the healthcare industry and disasters in global warming,” he said.”We decided to do a more intimate version of that story, which is much more interesting and topical.”  Added Murphy of the Katrina story, “Spike Lee did it better.”  Asked what makes for a compelling season of “American Crime Story,” he said, “It has to be about something that’s a bigger social issue,” he said. “I would never do Jon Benet Ramsay. I would never do the Menendez brothers because … I don’t know that they were about any meta social themes. I think ‘American Crime Story’ has to be about a bigger picture.”  Murphy said he was passionate about the upcoming “Versace” because “it was about homophobia in the ’90s,” he said, pointing to episodes that deal with coming out to parents and being gay in the military. “Those are incredible social stories,” he said. “That’s why we’re very slow to do them. And very quick to say this isn’t working, we’re going to try a different take.”  As for the next season of “Feud,” which will center around the fractured marriage of Charles and Diana, Murphy said he’s pleased with the scripts and is looking ahead to casting. “We keep moving the date because I’m working on so many great things,” he said. The project was set to shoot in May, but has now been bumped to the fall. He’s not concerned about comparisons to “The Crown” (which he admits he’s been binge-watching): “Our take is a much different take,” he said. “It’s not about the monarchy, it’s about the marriage.” That project, too, has yet to be cast; he’s also deciding whether he’s going to direct.  The Monica Lewinsky project is a “very tricky one,” he said. “We’re interviewing writers,” he said. “We’re not in any rush to do anything unless it’s done right.” Murphy said he’s trying to set up a dinner with Lewinsky: “I think it’s very important that her point of view is present,” he said. “I want to make sure that we do it right, and I think particularly now in this era we have an obligation to do a lot of research.” No actress is lined up for that role (he said he wants to get input from Lewinsky), but he does want Paulson to play Linda Tripp.  Paulson is also set to star in “Ratched” for Netflix. Murphy has arced out four seasons, with Paulson’s Nurse Ratched’s origin story as she faces off a different male adversary each season, with the final installment being her opposite the character played by Jack Nicholson in the film (a role yet to be cast). “It’s also a feminist tale,” he said. “It really looks at the birth of a lot of things that were happening in our healthcare system.” There’s no start date for “Ratched,” either — Murphy says he’s waiting until all eight scripts are written. “Sometimes it’s a little frustrating from a programming point of view,” he admits, but says L	1
Happy National Selfie Day!  In honor of this picturesque holiday, we’re showing you some of the most heartwarming, adorable and yes, sexy celebrity selfies.  And fans often go to extremes to be a part of them. Just this week, a star-struck man was so keen on getting a pic with Dwayne Johnson that he stopped his vehicle and ran up to The Rock’s car while he was behind the wheel…in the middle of traffic.  Of course, the actor is such a darn nice guy that he was totally into it. Sorry, drivers!  The fan got two selfies and a fist-bump.  “Holy s–t!” he said.	1
We are absolutely delighted to share that Sohni, a Sumatran tiger in our care at Disney’s Animal Kingdom, recently gave birth to a pair of tiger cubs, the first in the park’s history.  Sohni and her cubs are bonding well, and our dedicated team of animal care experts and veterinarians are focused on providing around-the-clock care for the tigers as they continue to monitor their progress. Guests can expect to see Sohni and her cubs on the Maharajah Jungle Trek within the next several months. In the meantime, watch the video below for a sneak peek at these adorable baby animals bonding with their mom.  Disney is proud to play an important role in the worldwide conservation and understanding of Sumatran tigers, a critically endangered species. Fewer than 500 Sumatran tigers exist in the wild, as the species is facing significant threats like habitat loss, poaching and the illegal wildlife trade. The Disney Conservation Fund (DCF) is working with groups like the Wildlife Conservation Society on its Reverse the Decline initiative to develop strategies for saving these amazing animals. To date, DCF has provided nearly $4 million to support the conservation of wild cat species like tigers, lions and snow leopards in 25 countries around the world.  These tiger cubs were bred by our dedicated and highly trained team of animal care experts through the Species Survival Plan, which is overseen by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums and ensures responsible breeding and diverse populations of threatened and endangered species.  We look forward to sharing more updates about Sohni and the cubs soon. In the meantime, visit DisneyAnimals.com to learn more about tigers and how you can help support them in the wild. Guests at Disney’s Animal Kingdom also can take part in Connect to Protect, a new mobile adventure that invites guests to participate in conservation “missions” with a digital scientist while exploring Pandora and helping protect the habits of at-risk animals here on Earth, like Sumatran tigers.	1
is not about gaining weight. She recently talked with the New York Times for a special article on dieting and weight gain. “So all of the people who are saying, ‘Oh, I need to accept myself as a I am’ — I can’t accept myself if I’m over 200 pounds,” she said. “Because it’s too much work on my heart. It causes high blood pressure for me. It puts me at risk for diabetes, because I have diabetes in my family.”Oprah has a very public history of battling weight gain. The 63-year-old mogul has even invested in health and weight loss programs, purchasing a 10 percent stake in Weight Watchers back in 2015. According to Page Six, Oprah has lost at least 40 pounds so far. When she explained why she got involved with Weight Watchers, Oprah said, “This whole P.C. about accepting yourself as you are – you should, 100 percent.” But,she went further, “It’s a mechanism to keep myself on track that brings a level of consciousness and awareness to my eating. It actually is, for me, mindful eating, because the points are so ingrained now.”  It seems like this is a two step process for the powerful O. Love yourself, then monitor your eating for a healthy life. Do you agree with Oprah’s statements? Let us know what you think in the comments below.	1
"William H. Macy backstage at the SAG Awards: 'It's hard to be a man these days'  Backstage at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, Shameless best-actor winner William H. Macy was asked if he had any advice for younger men on how to act around women in Hollywood.  His response, made earnestly, was ponderous, weighing the creative risks of creating a politically correct environment in the arts, gender parity (""it's inevitable"" he said firmly) and how men feel like ""we're under attack"" in the #MeToo era.  It was a puzzling mix.  On what he would tell younger men in his industry: ""That's a really complicated question because on one hand, with what we do for the living, we've got to be free to speak the unspeakable and try things. So I hope it doesn't throw a wet blanket on things. And I don't believe it will because half the business is women and they're smart,"" said Macy.  SAG Awards 2018: Time's Up quotes overheard on the red carpet  The actor noted he has two daughters (with wife Felicity Huffman). ""And I'm thrilled for them. It's a good time to be a girl. I'm proud of this business, because such things as safety in the workplace — that's done, we're not going back. It changed in an instant and it's not going back. When it comes to equality in pay, it's inevitable, and it's going to happen quickly.""  Macy then focused on how men are grappling with the #MeToo era.  ""It's hard to be a man these days,"" said Macy. ""I think a lot of us feel like we're under attack and feel like we need to apologize. Perhaps we do. Perhaps we are. But we'll keep talking.""  Macy added that he had recently convened with other men to discuss aspects of Time's Up, the anti-harassment initiative started earlier this month by some of Hollywood's leading women.  ""We had a meeting, a bunch of guys got together under the auspices of Time's Up. And that's good for men. Men don't talk enough, and they don't talk to other men. And we talked."""	1

"Selena Gomez and The Weeknd recently pulled the curtains down on their six-month romance.  While the songstress has reignited her relationship with ex Justin Bieber, the Canadian singer is said to be working on rekindling his love life with Bella Hadid, with whom he split in September 2016 after a year of dating.  Gomez, 25, was recently was pictured kissing Bieber, 23, at a hockey game following their numerous dates, while The Weeknd, 27, was spotted leaving Hadid's (21) apartment on 14 November.  â¨YOUR HOSTESS WITH THE MOSTESTâ¨@VMAS ð¸@shearerphoto A post shared by KATY PERRY (@katyperry) on Aug 26, 2017 at 9:42pm PDT  Although The Weeknd (real name Abel Tesfaye) has been trying to reconnect romantically with the model, he sparked dating rumours with a dinner date with Katy Perry, 33, at Madeo in West Hollywood on 20 November.  Gomez reportedly knows about The Weeknd's dinner date with Perry. So, was the songstress down with her former flame having dinner with the Roar hitmaker?  Gomez was said to be ""shocked"" after coming to know about her former boyfriend's night out with Perry.  ""Selena was shocked when she found out about The Weeknd meeting up with Katy Perry for dinner. Selena was a little confused by the randomness of those two meeting,"" a source told HollywoodLife.  ""She was like, 'Really? That's weird,' when she found out about the pair getting together in LA,"" the source added.  Gomez, however, thinks that nothing is going on between The Weeknd and Perry.  ""Selena figures Katy and Abel must be talking about music,"" the source said, ""And would be surprised if the dinner meeting turned into a more romantic relationship.""  Gomez could be right about her intuitions as an onlooker told People Magazine, ""It wasn't a date — they were with a group of people and they arrived and left separately. They dined on pasta, pizza and steak for three hours. They had intense conversations and everyone seemed to have a great time."""	0
It's no secret that the past few Keeping Up With The Kardashains episode has seen tensions rise between sisters Kourtney, Kim and Khloe.  And the family feud continued on Sunday night's episode when the Kardashian-Jenner brood all got together to decide who would and wouldn't make the invite list for their annual Christmas Eve party.  Sitting around the kitchen table together, momager Kris, Kim and Khloe all ganged up on Kourtney when they slammed her for not wanting to invite her ex-boyfriend Scott, and then Kendall when they refused to invite her dad Caitlyn Jenner.  Bad blood? Kendall Jenner was left livid on Sunday night's episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians when her mom Kris refused to invite her dad Caitlyn to the annual Christmas Eve party  The hostilities began when Kourtney told her family she didn't want to invite Scott as her then boyfriend Younes Bendjima, 25, would be there - to which Kris insisted her baby daddy had to come as he was still part of the family.  'What about my dad?' butted in Kendall - pointing out Kris' ex-husband also still had connections to the family.  'Scott has never done anything mean or said anything negative, so that's different,' shouted Kim across the table.  Drama: The hostilities began when Kourtney told her family she didn't want to invite Scott as her then boyfriend Younes Bendjima, 25, would be there - to which Kris insisted her baby daddy had to come as he was still part of the family  Not hearing her: The family refused to listen to Kourtney's wishes of not inviting her ex-boyfriend Scott Disick to the family party  If Scott's invited, why not Caitlyn? Not having a bar of it, a livid and insulted Kendall replied: 'Is that actually a joke? They have both done f**ked up things in different ways'  Not having a bar of it, a livid and insulted Kendall replied: 'Is that actually a joke? They have both done f**ked up things in different ways'.  And although Kendall continued to defend Cait and fight for her right to make the invite list, the Kardashian matriarch wasn't convinced.  'No-one would know how to respond to her because of all the things,' she began to explain.  Kris' reasoning: 'No-one would know how to respond to her because of all the things,' she began to explain  She got the last word: As Kris, Kim and Khloe continued to explain how the situations were different and at the end of the day it was the momager's choice, Kourtney was the only one with the Vogue model's back  And the drama didn't end there with Kendall continuing to convince the family that no matter what had happened it was still the nice thing to do and the situation was no different to that of Scott's.  'So the f**k what? Why are we so worried about anyone else, even if she doesn't come it is the nice thing to do,' she said angrily.  Kris replied sassily: 'Oh, she would come.'  Bonding: The episode saw Kendall and Kourtney spend much time hanging out as they felt they were the only ones who 'got' each other  Doing it for the kids: Kourtney sat down with Scott and explained that she had decided to let him come for the children's memories  As Kris, Kim and Khloe continued to explain how the situations were different and at the end of the day it was the momager's choice, Kourtney was the only one with the Vogue model's back.  'I am so over everyone and their b**chieness,' said the eldest sister to camera, adding that she didn't like the fact that her family didn't have her back and was appalled by the way they were treating Kendall.  However, the end of the episode saw Kim reveal not only did Kourtney have a change of heart and invite Scott, but Kris changed her mind and sent Cait an invite too. She however opted not to attend.  Party time: Kris changed her mind and sent Cait an invite too. She however opted not to attend  Time to celebrate!

"hollywood  Updated: Feb 16, 2018 17:16 IST  It happened when Brad Pitt separated from wife Angelina Jolie, and now it’s happening again when Jennifer Aniston announced her split from husband Justin Theroux. The exes, who were married for five years between 2000 and 2005, are being linked again.  Aniston on Friday announced that she had quietly separated from Theroux at the end of last year. “In an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation. This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship,” the couple said in a joint statement.  “Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else’s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another,” they said.  Pitt and Jolie abruptly announced their split towards the end of 2016. They met on the sets of their 2005 movie, Mr & Mrs Smith. Their separation was followed by a bitter custody battle over their six children. In the months that followed, it was rumoured that Pitt had reached out to Aniston over text messages, and that she had responded.  Now, Twitter is alive with conspiracies, pipe dreams and wishful thinking. We’ve found some of the best reactions for you to check out.  #JenniferAniston  When u realize both Jennifer Aniston & Brad Pitt are now single pic.twitter.com/Y9cxfIWQyH — Sonia Grace (@Sonia_GoodGirl) February 15, 2018  Jennifer Aniston: single ✔️  Brad Pitt: single ✔️ pic.twitter.com/glMAiNSQXz — coloradainútil (@soyluluuu) February 16, 2018  Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie split.

"""This Is Us"" is undoubtedly the breakout broadcast TV series of the past three years: Nothing has rivaled the show's grasp on the zeitgeist more than the NBC drama, and that doesn't seem to be changing anytime soon.  Part of what has driven the success of the Dan Fogelman-created series is its emotional punch -- the ability it has to leave you crying tears of joy or happiness or both -- week after week. But another reason for its success is its deeply talented roster of stars from the adults all the way to the young actors.  One of those young stars is 11-year-old Parker Bates, who plays young Kevin Pearson. The Dallas-born actor has captured the hearts of America through his portrayal of the younger version of Justin Hartley's character, perfectly capturing his charm, anger and up-and-down relationship with his brother, Randall (played by Lonnie Chavis).  During a recent phone call with Bates, AOL asked the rising star what he'd like to see more of when it comes to Kevin's younger years, and he had a quick answer: More time with his love interest, Sophie.  ""I hope to see some more of young Kevin and young Sophie together, because we didn’t really get to spend a lot of time with Kevin and Sophie when they were younger,"" he told us, adding that he ""can't say much"" about what's to come on the current third season of the show.  17 PHOTOS 'This Is Us' star Parker Bates See Gallery 'This Is Us' star Parker Bates HOLLYWOOD, CA - SEPTEMBER 25: Parker Bates attends the Season 3 Premiere of NBC's 'This Is Us' at Paramount Studios on September 25, 2018 in Hollywood, California.

"Monday's episode of ""American Idol"" was the season's most dramatic yet, as we learned which six of the 14 finalists had been voted through to the top 10 by America, and which of the remaining contestants had to sing for their lives in hopes of being chosen by the judges.  In the end, we had our top 10:  Eric McCandless/ABC  Catie Turner -- Chosen by America  -- Chosen by America Dennis Lorenzo -- Judges' pick  -- Judges' pick Michael J. Woodard -- Chosen by America  -- Chosen by America Jurnee -- Judges' pick  -- Judges' pick Gabby Barrett -- Chosen by America  -- Chosen by America Ada Vox -- Judges' pick  -- Judges' pick Maddie Poppe -- Chosen by America  -- Chosen by America Michelle Sussett -- Judges' pick  -- Judges' pick Cade Foehner -- Chosen by America  -- Chosen by America Caleb Lee Hutchinson -- Chosen by America  Eric McCandless/ABC  Here's how it went down:  There were two sets of chairs onstage: the Victory Zone and the Danger Zone. Over two hours, Ryan Seacrest revealed whether each contestant had been voted into the top 10 by America. Those who were voted through got to sing a song without being judged, and then take a seat in the Victory Zone. Those who weren't had to ""sing for their lives,"" and their fates were revealed at the end of the show.  Michelle Sussett, the first contestant in the ""Danger Zone,"" sang an original song called ""I'm a Dreamer,"" with lyrics in both English and Spanish, which made a powerful statement about the immigrant experience. ""This is my home and I love this country and I'm grateful to be here,"" the Venezuelan singer said. Judge Katy Perry was thrilled that she sang in Spanish, and she was the one who announced that she'd been chosen for the top 10.  Marcio Donaldson sang ""Jealous"" by Nick Jonas and it wasn't his best performance. You could tell from the judges' comments that there was no way they were putting him through.  Garrett Jacobs sang ""Have You Ever Seen the Rain"" by Creedence Clearwater Revival and, though Perry said it was the best he'd ever sounded, he wasn't chosen.  Dennis Lorenzo sang Maxwell's version of the Kate Bush song ""This Woman's Work."" Perry called the performance ""brilliant"" and ""dynamic"" and said she'd fight for him; Lionel Richie said he didn't know what America was thinking by not putting him through. Luke Bryan was the one who announced he'd been chosen for the top 10.  Jonny Brenns sang a compelling version of ""Demons"" by Imagine Dragons that got him a standing ovation from the judges; Perry praised him for looking like a rock star, but criticized him for not having enough stage presence. In the end, he failed to make it through.  Mara Justine sang ""Love on the Brain"" by Rihanna, which made Bryan say he was ""in shock"" that she wasn't voted through by America. But Perry told the young teen that sometimes it's just about timing, which was a big giveaway that she wasn't going to be chosen.  Jurnee sang ""Never Enough"" from ""The Greatest Showman.” Richie simply said, ""I love you"" and he announced that they'd picked her for the top 10.  Ada Vox was the last contestant to sing for their lives, and sang ""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going,"" so memorably delivered by ""American Idol"" alumna Jennifer Hudson in ""Dreamgirls.""  To say Vox brought the house down is an understatement; after the performance, Perry took off her earrings and announced that she and the other judges were making an executive decision: They ordered Vox to go to the Victory Zone immediately.  After Vox was chosen, the remaining seven contestants had to wait to hear which three would be staying. After Jurnee, Dennis and Michelle were declared the lucky ones, the rest of the pack were told by Perry, ""Over 10 million people are watching this. So what are you going to do with that information? You're going to launch off on your own.""  The top 10 will perform Disney's greatest hits Sunday, and there will be the first-ever, coast-to-coast, live vote, with the results coming at the end of the show."	1
The CW’s new Charmed reboot has its fair share of critics — but Shannen Doherty is not among them.  Doherty, who played Prue Halliwell in three of the original drama’s eight seasons, stood behind the new version during a Q&A at Comic-Con Paris.  “I have seen a lot of people be very mean and very negative and cruel to the new show and the new cast,” Doherty began, after the mere mention of The CW’s reboot drew boos from the crowd. “I want to remind everybody that these are three girls who just want to act. They got a huge opportunity, and I would implore everybody to be a little bit kinder.”  Doherty went on to speak about the reboot’s “positive, good influence,” adding that “this is a show about three strong women again… I know that it may not be your Charmed, but you should all really pat yourselves on the back and congratulate yourselves, because you’re the most loyal, amazing fans in the world. And because of you, you made it a show that a younger generation wants to see.”  She continued: “You have to think about what Charmed did for you when it was on and think about what that’s going to do for a new generation. Embrace it, you guys. It’s doing well, ratings-wise, and it’s employing over 200 people.” (Having dipped both weeks since its launch, Charmed is thus far averaging 1.33 million total viewers and a 0.42 demo rating, ranking fifth and fourth among all CW shows.)  Doherty has had kind words for the Charmed reboot since it was first announced. She came to the project’s defense back in January, saying that she was “intrigued by the idea that a new generation might be comforted.”  Original Charmed star Holly Marie Combs, meanwhile, has been critical of the new version from the start. After The CW placed a pilot order for the reboot, she tweeted that Charmed “belongs to the four of us, our vast amount of writers, crews and predominantly the fans. You will not fool them by owning a title/stamp. So bye.”  Update: Similarly, fellow original cast member Alyssa Milano has called the reboot a “hurtful situation,” saying, “It’s hard for us to see something that we loved so dearly then be taken from us in a way that had absolutely nothing to do with anything that we had done and created…. [T]he only reason why the show is able to have a reboot is because of the relationships we created.”  New episodes of Charmed air Sundays at 9/8c on The CW.	1

"Vanessa Hudgens Reveals Her Favorite Memory With Ashley Tisdale—And It Totally Involves High School Musical  Some memories are just too magical to forget.  As Vanessa Hudgens prepared to co-host the 2017 Billboard Music Awards with Ludacris, the singer couldn't help but express her excitement at the star-studded night.  In addition, the former High School Musical star was delighted to know close friend Ashley Tisdale would be inside the T-Mobile Arena ready to support her.  During Live From the Red Carpet, E! News' Jason Kennedy revealed the question Ashley had for her BFF before showtime. What's your favorite thing we've done together?  ""Probably just fly around the entire world with her. I mean, we were on our High School Musical press tour, and being in a G-5 we're, like, I'm going to have a G-5 one day and I'm going to cover it in Louis Vuitton print and it's going to be gorgeous,"" Vanessa shared with us. ""Her wedding was pretty amazing as well.""  Back in 2006, Vanessa and Ashley became household names as they danced and sang throughout Disney Channel's original movie. Ever since then, the pair has stayed close friends and remained supportive of each other.  Disney aside, Vanessa is more than ready to co-host one of the biggest award shows of the year.  Hours before Nicki Minaj would open up the show, the ""Reminding Me"" singer teased some of the fun coming soon.  ""We did a full run-through earlier,"" she explained to us. ""Definitely took my shoes off and danced for Cher. Definitely sat in the chair holding my heart as it was like breaking and I was falling for Céline Dion. It's been a journey.""  As for her latest song with Shawn Hook, Vanessa is thrilled people are loving the new track."	1

"He knows a large part of that is on him. As he fought to earn time with his kids, Pitt also set upon a self-improvement crash course designed to transform him into the type of dad he wanted to be. ""I grew up with a Father-knows-best/war mentality—the father is all-powerful, super strong—instead of really knowing the man and his own self-doubt and struggles,"" he offered by way of explanation to GQ Style. ""And it's hit me smack in the face with our divorce: I gotta be more. I gotta be more for them. I have to show them. And I haven't been great at it.""  Save from a Golden Globe appearance that proved the bulk of Hollywood was still in his corner, the actor dipped underground for several months, committing himself to a life of cranberry juice and fizzy water—""I was boozing too much. It's just become a problem,"" he said of what he called his ability to drink a Russian under the table with his own vodka—and therapy.  ""For me this period has really been about looking at my weaknesses and failures and owning my side of the street,"" he noted in the 2017 profile. ""I'm an a--hole when it comes to this need for justice. I don't know where it comes from, this hollow quest for justice for some perceived slight. I can drill on that for days and years. It's done me no good whatsoever. It's such a silly idea, the idea that the world is fair. And this is coming from a guy who hit the lottery, I'm well aware of that. I hit the lottery, and I still would waste my time on those hollow pursuits."""	0
Do you miss Carmen Sandiego?  We may see her again soon on Netflix. As Tracking Board reports, Netflix will release 20 brand new episodes of the legendary ’90s character’s animated series. The purpose will remain the same – to teach children about geography in an entertaining way.  The new voice for Carmen will, according to the same report, be Gina Rodriguez, best known for leading role in Jane the Virgin.	1
"Let me take you back to a simpler time: 2015. A time when we didn't have the threat of nuclear war with North Korea, Fuller House didn't exist, and Kim Kardashian was all about selfies. That last one is particularly important. Kim loved selfies back then—well, she loved them before that too. This is a woman who, when faced with the prospect of her sister going to jail, took photos of herself. A woman who announced to the world she's voting for Hillary Clinton via selfie. A woman who didn't let an elephant's rogue trunk get in the way of the perfect photo. She quite literally published a 448-page book about selfies. I'm not kidding. 448 pages. Of just selfies. Called Selfish.  And now that same woman is denouncing the art form she commodified. Yes, my friends, Kim Kardashian just announced that selfies are O-V-E-R. If that's not a sign the world is up in flames, I don't know what is. We now live in an era when, if Khloé goes to jail, Kim would be a supportive sister. What fresh hell is this?  Kim dropped this bombshell while playing a game of ""Would You Rather?"" with, ironically, Khloé. When Khloé asked Kim to choose between never posting a selfie again or never Snapchatting again, she (blasphemously) picked the former.  ""I would rather never be able to post a selfie again. Take a selfie,"" Kim, who once went out of her way to vogue behind a stranger's selfie, said. ""I kinda feel like selfies are kind of a few years ago.""  A few years ago? Then what is now, Kim? How are we supposed to express our love for Fit Tea, large salads, and Balmain's siiiiiick new collection in 2017?  Kim's Instagram profile has the answer. True to her sacrilegious words, she hasn't posted a selfie in a while. Her immediate feed is just a bunch of well-staged photos taken by other people. So is that what's now? Asking someone to take our Instagram photos? Hiring a Jonathan Cheban clone to follow us around everywhere (the grocery store, the club, Kylie's Lip Kit factory), feverishly take photos of us, and then picking the best ones? I now have to bring other people into my Valencia-tinted orbit? Actually, wait, I'm sure the Valencia Instagram filter is ""kind of a few years ago"" too.  It's official, people: The Internet is canceled. This GIF is a lie.  Related Stories:  Kim Kardashian Wore a Sheer Gucci Bra to Buy Gummy Bears. That's All."	1
"American basketball player  This article is about the American basketball player. For other people with the same name, see Stephen Curry (disambiguation)  Wardell Stephen ""Steph"" Curry II ( STEF-ən; born March 14, 1988) is an American professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). A six-time NBA All-Star, he has been named the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) twice and won three NBA championships with the Warriors. Many players and analysts have called him the greatest shooter in NBA history.[1] He is credited with revolutionizing the game of basketball by inspiring teams to regularly employ the three-point shot as part of their winning strategy.[2][3][4]  In 2014–15, Curry won his first MVP award and led the Warriors to their first championship since 1975. The following season, he became the first player in NBA history to be elected MVP by a unanimous vote and to lead the league in scoring while shooting above 50–40–90. That same year, the Warriors broke the record for the most wins in an NBA season en route to reaching the 2016 NBA Finals, which they lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Curry helped the Warriors return to the NBA Finals in 2017, 2018 and 2019, and they won back-to-back titles in 2017 and 2018.  Curry is the son of former NBA player Dell Curry and older brother of current NBA player Seth Curry. He played college basketball for the Davidson Wildcats. There, he was twice named Southern Conference Player of the Year and set the all-time scoring record for both Davidson and the Southern Conference. During his sophomore year, he also set the single-season NCAA record for three-pointers made.  During the 2012–13 season, Curry set the NBA record for three-pointers made in a regular season with 272. He surpassed that record in 2015 with 286, and again in 2016 with 402. Curry is currently third in all-time made three-pointers in NBA history. The 2012–13 season saw Curry and teammate Klay Thompson earn the nickname of the Splash Brothers, with the pair going on to set the NBA record for combined three-pointers in a season with 484 in 2013–14, a record they broke the following season (525) and again in the 2015–16 season (678).  Early life  Wardell Stephen Curry II is the son of Sonya and Dell Curry. He was born in Akron, Ohio while his father was a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers.[5][6] He grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, where his father spent most of his NBA career with the Charlotte Hornets.[7] Dell often took Curry and his younger brother Seth to his games, where they would shoot with the Hornets during warm-ups.[8] The family briefly relocated to Toronto, where Dell finished out his career as a member of the Raptors.[7] During this time, Curry played for the Queensway Christian College boys' basketball team, leading them to an undefeated season.[9][10] He was also a member of Toronto 5–0, a club team that plays across Ontario,[11][12] pitting him against fellow future NBA players Cory Joseph and Kelly Olynyk.[12] Curry led the team to a 33–4 record, en route to winning the provincial championship.[13]  Following Dell's retirement, the family moved back to Charlotte and Curry enrolled at Charlotte Christian School, where he was named all-conference, all-state, and led his team to three conference titles and three state playoff appearances. Because of his father's storied career at Virginia Tech, Curry wanted to play college basketball for the Hokies, but was only offered a walk-on spot due in part to his slender 160-pound frame.[14] He ultimately chose to attend Davidson College, who had aggressively recruited him from the tenth grade.[15]  College career  Freshman season  Before Curry even played in his first game for the Wildcats, head coach Bob McKillop praised him at a Davidson alumni event, ""Wait 'til you see Steph Curry. He is something special.""[16] In his first collegiate game, against Eastern Michigan, Curry finished with 15 points but committed "	1
"""House of Cards"" is one of Netflix's biggest shows, but one of its stars is still not getting an equal share of the deck.  Robin Wright made headlines last year when she said she wasn't being paid the same as costar Kevin Spacey.  In an interview last May with Judith Rodin, the president of The Rockefeller Foundation, Wright said she told producers ""I want to be paid the same as Kevin.""  ""I was looking at the statistics and Claire Underwood's character was more popular than [Frank's] for a period of time,"" Wright said. ""So I capitalized on it. I was like, 'You better pay me or I'm going to go public.'""  Robin Wright demanded equal 'House of Cards' pay  Spacey was reportedly being paid $500,000 an episode in 2014. Forbes reported in 2015 that Wright made estimated $5.5 million from ""House of Cards,"" which comes out to approximately $420,000 an episode.  But in a recent interview with United Airlines in-flight magazine Rhapsody the actress said that increased payday never came.  ""I don't think I'm getting paid the same amount,"" she said. ""They told me I was getting a raise. But ... I don't think so.""  Wright said she never intended to become a spokesperson for gender pay disparity but ""That was one of 20 questions they asked me, and it went viral.""  According to the publication, Media Rights Capital -- the company that produces ""House of Cards"" -- noted it wasn't possible for the two actors to make the same since Spacey is one of the show's founding producers.  Instead, Wright received an executive producer credit and the opportunities to serve as director.  She said in the Rhapsody interview, ""I really don't like being duped.""  ""It's such a male-dominant workforce still,"" Wright said. ""There's a conditioning. And changing the condition of men is what needs to happen.""  Last year Forbes named Spacey the 12th highest paid TV actor of 2016, estimating he earned $10.5 million for his role as the diabolical Underwood. Wright did not make their list last year of the 15 highest paid TV actresses."	1
"Kylie Jenner is pretty busy thanks to having a casual billion-dollar (almost) beauty empire, a reality TV show, and a new baby girl. She also happens to maintain a pretty solid health and fitness routine, which is an impressive and inspiring feat regardless of how busy you are. Wanna know exactly how she does it? Of course you do.  1. She Exercises on Her Terms  Unlike her siblings who go hard at the gym and chronicle everything from leg day to beach yoga on their social media, Kylie seems to work out infrequently. Actually, she only recently started getting into a regular gym routine post-baby.  ""I planned my first workout for Monday,"" Kylie said during a Q&A with her best friend Jordyn Woods, which she filmed after she'd given birth to Stormi. ""I'm not even doing it to get in shape.""  So how does Kylie exercise when she does feels like it? Thanks to Instagram, we know she takes walks with Baby Stormi, and goes paddle boarding (which both happen to double as photo opps, ahem):  Strong is sexy, and clearly Kylie knows it.  2. She Eats Fast Food When She Craves It  Anyone who follows Kylie on Snapchat knows she loves In-N-Out Burger (saaaaame). The fast food was her biggest pregnancy craving, because—as she explained to her doctor in her birth announcement video—""It’s just In-N-Out these days literally tastes like...nothing I’ve ever had.""  3. But She Also Tries to Eat Organic Meals  When she's not indulging her In-N-Out cravings, Kylie tends to eat organic foods. ""Kylie eats like a typical teenager but she's also super aware of what she puts in her body when it comes to fresh and organic foods,"" Khloé Kardashian once said of her sister's daily diet.    4. She Can't Eat Dairy  Kylie is lactose intolerant, so completely cutting out dairy had a big impact on her overall health. ""I didn't realize I was lactose intolerant. I just became lactose intolerant, like, this year,"" she explained back in 2015. Once she stopped consuming dairy, Kylie told E! News that she naturally slimmed down.  FYI, if you're wondering whether it's common to develop lactose intolerance later in life, the answer is yes! You could even say it's pretty typical: The NIH reports that ""approximately 65 percent of the human population has a reduced ability to digest lactose after infancy.""  5. She's All About Home Cooking  Cooking at home is a great way to maintain a balanced diet, since you can make a cheesy (or in Kylie's case, a cheese-free) pizza topped with pepperoni one night, and a grain bowl packed with veggies the next. ""I love cooking these days,"" Kylie said in 2016. ""I like to make burgers. I also make spaghetti because my mom is obsessed with spaghetti. It's the first thing I learned to cook. I love potatoes; I'll make all different kinds of potatoes, like scalloped potatoes, mashed potatoes, candied yams.""  Kylie often showcases her cooking adventures on social media. Here's some yummy footage of bacon from her Snapchat:  P.S. Travis Scott has also revealed that she makes a mean peanut butter and jelly sandwich. The more you know!  6. She Realized Cleanses Are BS  Kylie has absolutely no tolerance for them—as evidenced by the one time she documented her attempt at a juice cleanse on Snapchat, only lasted three drinks, and then decided to get sushi instead.  7. She Rarely (If Ever) Touches Alcohol  There's nothing wrong with kicking back with a glass of wine, but Kylie—who is still under 21—hadn't drunk a drop of booze as of August 2017. ""You know, I've never had a drink before,"" she admitted in an interview. None of Kardashian-Jenner sisters are big drinkers (Khloé is the only one who even dabbles), so perhaps Kylie inherited this preference from her fam.  8. She Works Out with Her Family  Back in 2016, Kylie revealed that she works out with Kourtney and uses the same trainer as Kanye West:  I work out with [my sister] Kourtney and her trainer, who is also Kanye's trainer. We work out for an hour. It's hard, but it makes me feel good. Kourtney likes "	1

DJ Khaled was clear that he wasn’t the cause of his fraught Electric Daisy Carnival set in Las Vegas last weekend. The rapper/producer, who was scheduled for an hour-long set, performed for less than 20 minutes before fans booed him off the stage, chanting for Yellow Claw, the next DJ, to take over.  “Due to technical difficulties beyond DJ Khaled and Insomniac’s control, Khaled was not able to perform at his scheduled time on Sunday night at EDC,” Insomniac CEO Pasquale Rotella said to Rolling Stone. “He arrived on time and ready to rock the crowd, but equipment issues delayed the performance. Even though there were technical difficulties, he still got onstage and showed his fans love.”  On Instagram, Khaled reiterated that his EDC set was compromised by technical issues. “They cut my time short and they had me backstage for a hour and half and the sound kept breaking,” he captioned a video clip. “Then I heard my fans and I said I’m go out even if the sound cuts off and even if they cut my time short … I’m here for my fans even if the sound man and promoter don’t have there stuff together I forgive them thoe love is the [key.]”  “They tried to sabotage my sound,” Khaled said in another post. “I still stood on stage wit no sound, and when they got the sound to work they want cut my set short … I still rep for my people,” he continued. “Anyone else would walk off stage.”The rapper continued his rant in a second post to Instagram, claiming that he was “sabotaged.”  They? Tried to sabotage my sound so many times THEY couldnot get the sound right on my set and i still stood on stage wit no sound and when they got the sound to work they want cut my set short but I still rep for my people anyone else would walk off stage .. i knew my California and Vegas fans was in the building .. THEY? DONT WANT US TO WIN SO WE WIN MORE FOR THERE HEAD TOP!!! It’s all luv thoe .. love is the ?.. I forgive them … love is always the answer ! A post shared by DJ KHALED (@djkhaled) on Jun 19, 2017 at 2:17am PDT  In the second clip, Khaled tries to make up for the technical difficulties during his time onstage by playing 2Pac’s classic “California Love.” “They want to cut my shit … but this is California,” he says in the video. Las Vegas is, in fact, located in Nevada, as several fans were quick to point out.  Earlier this year, Khaled also caught flack for a subpar performance at the Coachella Music and Arts Festival, where his sound was similarly cut off when he went over his scheduled time by several minutes.	1

"Katy Perry has finally responded to plastic surgery rumors, denying that she's had any work done. In an interview with Refinery29, the singer opens up about the negative stigma around plastic surgery and how she feels it's slowly disappearing.  ""I haven't had any,"" she said about plastic surgery. ""I've done lasers and got [filler] injections under my eyes for the hollowing—which I'd recommend for everyone who wants a solution for their dark circles—but all of my assets are real. People tend to think they are fake, but it doesn't really matter.""  The singer—who's often been speculated for having work done—wants everyone to know that even if she had, it would be okay.  ""We're getting away from that negative stigma about physical alterations. Of course, always be your authentic self, but if someone wants a nose job that makes them feel better, and they love their profile more because of it, it's like 'Go ahead!'"" she said. ""Do whatever makes you feel better about yourself.""    Other celebrities like Chrissy Teigen, Ariel Winter, and Iggy Azalea have openly admitted to having plastic surgery."	1
"Sasha Pieterse revealed on Tuesday night's ""Dancing with the Stars"" she gained 70 pounds over two years due to a hormone condition called Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS).  The former ""Pretty Little Liars"" star, who will act in an upcoming spinoff of the Freeform show, cried on camera recalling how online haters called her fat and even wondered if she was pregnant.  But Pieterse, 21, was diagnosed with the hormone imbalance and has lost 15 pounds so far while performing on ""DWTS.""  ""I’m feeling like me again,"" Pieterse said on ""DWTS,"" adding, ""Being on the show, I’ve lost over 15 pounds. It’s not an easy road, but being able to focus on getting myself healthy again, and the fact that I’m seeing results, getting better is all I can ask for.""  After dancing a samba with partner Gleb Savchenko on Tuesday's show for a strong score of 22 and judges' raves, she sobbed to co-host Erin Andrews, ""I went through a hard time.""  After the show, Pieterse told reporters of her medical condition, ""It's a combination of me finding out what I have and 'Dancing with the Stars' helps me tremendously…but just the process, how hard we're working and how healthy I feel, I really feel like myself again. It's great.""  The star explained with PCOS ""there's a lot of symptoms that can be many things for women.""  ""It's like irregular periods, weight gain, [it's] impossible to lose weight. There's all these things that seem somewhat normal sometimes, depending on your lifestyle, but I feel like you just kind of have to go and get it checked because if you have a hormonal imbalance, it could definitely be PCOS and that can lead to ovarian cancer and breast cancer and thyroid issues and many things later that could have been avoided. More than half of women have it and they don't even know. It really is a huge issue I really want to share and hopefully help people deal with it.""  She said feeling better ""makes me more comfortable and confident and I'm doing two dances really well in the second week [of the show], which is really hard. That makes me feel even more excited for the next week.""  The actress said backstage she follows a healthy diet, noting, ""I was exercising like crazy and eating the best that I could before so this just heightens it.""  Pieterse is thrilled that partner Savchenko and everyone else at ""DWTS"" has been so supportive of her journey.  ""The fact that I can open up and share this with people and hopefully bring awareness to PCOS is really all I can ask for. It's been an amazing experience,"" she said."	1

Now that Blake Griffin has suffered a crippling knee injury, Kendall Jenner feels ‘horrible’. Even worse, she fears that she will somehow be blamed for his bad luck this season.  “Kendall [Jenner] feels horrible about Blake [Griffin]‘s injury. Kendall fears she will somehow be blamed for his bad luck. She has heard about the Kardashian curse for years and thinks it is just ridiculous. She also understands how dedicated fans may look for anyway to make sense of a bad situation. But in the end, Kendall feels like any accusations towards her are simply unfair, misguided anger. Kendall loves watching Blake play and she knows how important basketball is in his life, so she is going to do everything she can to care, support and help him get back to his teammates ASAP,” a source close to Kendall tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  At this time, it’s not clear how Blake’s injury (which occurred during a game on Nov. 28) will affect the rest of his basketball season, but sources told ESPN that he could be out for two months! And that wouldn’t be good for the Los Angeles Clippers, who have already endured a 9-game losing streak. Obviously, these things happen, but Kendall is afraid fans will blame her for Blake’s recent bad luck. As we EXCLUSIVELY learned, fans are already blaming Kendall for the team’s horrible season. “The Clippers are playing terrible and have lost nine in a row and the blame is going all around to every player in the organization,” a source close to the team EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com. “Some of the teammates of Blake who are superstitious to it all believe that the Kardashian Curse is a real thing and has something to do with their woes even though Blake is laughing all that off and isn’t taking that as the reason for their losing streak and bad play. It hasn’t started a riff between teammates yet but the talk in the locker room has involved Kendall so it should be interesting moving forward how people continue to react to it all.”  We don’t think the “Kardashian curse” is real, but we can see why Kendall’s now afraid fans will also blame her for Blake’s injury. Hopefully, she ignores the haters and just focuses on helping Blake return to the court as soon as possible!  HollywoodLifers, is the “Kardashian cure” to blame for Blake’s injury?

And they say Diana reveals the second will follow “in a few years” – even going as far as revealing that one of them will be a girl.  The stunning revelations come from Terry and Linda Jamison, dubbed “Nostradamus in Stilettos”, whose astonishing Royal Wedding prediction appeared to come true last weekend.  They told us that Diana would attend the Windsor Castle wedding and appear as a butterfly, then during the ceremony a fly was captured on video hitting Meghan’s face.  (Image: PA)  The twins also correctly predicted each of Prince William and Kate Middleton’s children in 2011 during a TV appearance on Sunrise Australia.  Now, in their latest conversation with Diana from beyond the grave, the Princess appears to have revealed when the new Duke and Duchess of Sussex will have children.

Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton returned to TV screens for Season 12 of The Voice on February 27, but their on-set flirting had fans threatening to turn off.  After taking two seasons away from The Voice as a coach, Gwen was back by her man’s side when Season 12 of the NBC singing show kicked off, but it turns out that not everyone was so happy to see Stefani and Shelton side by side, as their romance and PDA had some viewers reaching for the remote.  A number of viewers took to social media to voice their opinions during The Voice’s Season 12 premiere opener, with some even threatening to turn off the series to avoid Blake and Gwen’s flirting that played a big part in the first episode of the popular NBC series.  “If the Blake and Gwen relationship is going to be this annoying every episode I [probably] won’t watch The Voice anymore,” Twitter user @claireecruz5 tweeted out of The Voice’s Season 12 premiere, while @j_alatoree added, “Blake and Gwen’s relationship has ruined The Voice for me. They are already annoying me!”  “When u realize that it’s going to be a long season of The Voice if Blake and Gwen keep flirting every 5 seconds #TheVoice,” Twitter user @makennaacypert wrote on the 140-character site during The Voice’s Season 12 premiere, alongside photos showing her turning off the show after seeing Shelton and Stefani’s gushing interactions.  [Image by Charley Gallay/Getty Images for People's Choice Awards]  “@NBCTheVoice I wish the show was focused more on the talent than Gwen & Blake #annoying #TheVoice #ImOverIt #verydisappointing,” The Voice viewer @NicolFranz69 tweeted of Stefani’s flirty interactions with her boyfriend, while @riitaloretta wrote on the social media site during the premiere episode, “Gwen is so annoying on #thevoice. She legit brings up her relationship [with] Blake every 5 seconds.”  “Gwen and Blake are nauseating,” The Voice fan @alleb35 then added as Shelton and Stefani showed off their flirting and romance, “and I’m gonna turn the show off.”  Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton’s romance, which began after they met on the show in 2015, was on full display on the February 27 premiere episode of The Voice, as Entertainment Tonight reported that the couple’s co-coach Adam Levine even commented that being in the middle of Shelton and Stefani made him a little uncomfortable amid allegations Stefani’s return supposedly hasn’t exactly been championed by The Voice crew.  After both Gwen and Adam pushed their buttons for a contestant, Blake made it pretty clear that he wanted to see the singer head to Stefani’s team, urging him to say yes to Gwen and not his longtime co-coach Adam.  [Image by Kevin Winter/Getty Images]  Loading...  “When they both push, because they’re dating, sometimes I feel like a third wheel in this thing,” Levine then admitted of the awkward moment after Shelton and Stefani made it pretty clear that they aren’t going to be hiding their romance on Season 12 of The Voice like they have in past seasons.  The site then noted that Gwen also headed over and sat on Blake’s lap during the episode after once again bringing up the fact that she and Shelton are dating by calling the singer her “boyfriend” and telling a contestant that she could “use her connections to her boyfriend to help them navigate the world of country music” after they revealed their dreams to become a country star.  Yahoo! also reported that Stefani and Shelton’s romance was on full display on The Voice opener, confirming that Gwen sat on Blake’s lap more than once during the episode to show her affection for the country star, much to Levine’s dismay.  “What happened to you, Blake? Are you okay?” Levine jokingly asked Shelton during the flirty episode with Stefani.  What did you think of Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani showing off their romance on the show? Was their PDA and flirting sweet or too much for The Voice Season 12 premiere?  [Featured Image by Rachel Murray/Getty Images for Glamour]	0
Prince Harry has always been viewed as quite the catch. The dashing, ginger-haired royal has jetted around the globe for years to represent his family at charitable events. He’s been admired by many for his convictions to worthy causes. It was only a matter of time for the prince to meet his match in Meghan Markle, another successful socialite devoted to philanthropy.  While each half of the couple is financially set in their own right, Prince Harry is said to be worth $40 million – which is only a fraction of his family’s worth, including palaces, jewels, and artwork. Once they have tied the knot, however, the prince is unlikely to share his royal fortune with his American bride for one surprising reason. It has to do with her nationality. Here we’ll take a look at the factors involved.  Markle will become a British citizen  Meghan Markle will officially remain an American for now. | Chris Jackson/Getty Images Meghan Markle will officially remain an American for now. | Chris Jackson/Getty Images  The citizenship process takes 3 years.  When the couple’s engagement was announced in December 2017, it was revealed Markle would become a British citizen. This process will likely take about three years. “She intends to become a U.K. citizen and will go through the process of that, which some of you know takes a number of years,” said Prince Harry’s communications secretary, Jason Knauf. “She will retain her U.S. citizenship through that process.”  It has not yet been revealed whether Markle will ultimately give up her American citizenship or maintain a dual nationality status.

While she remains a U.S. citizen, Markle’s income will continue to be taxed by Uncle Sam. Much of this income currently comes from her USA Network show Suits. It was revealed in November 2017 Markle would leave the popular legal drama at the end of Season 7. (The second half of that season is set to air in 2018.) Markle reportedly earns more than $50,000 per episode of Suits. Her estimated yearly income is $450,000, which also includes around $80,000 in endorsement money, according to knownetworth.com.

When Princess Diana died in 1997, Prince Harry inherited half of her estate, which was worth about $29.2 million. He also shares a $4.7 million annual allowance with his brother and sister-in-law, Prince William and Kate Middleton.

If Markle receives any money from the royal family, she may need to pay U.S. income taxes on it. “If she receives money from her husband or his family, and that’s considered income, she would have to pay income tax on that,” royal expert Marlene Koenig told The Sun.  Interestingly, if the couple were to marry and then live in the United States, Prince Harry wouldn’t be expected to file taxes in Britain. The U.S. system of taxing its citizens abroad is unusual.

"""Jacob and Renesmee seemed alike in so many ways, both half-and-half beings, two things at the same time."" ―Bella on Renesmee and Jacob's similarities.[src]  Jacob Black imprinted on Renesmee Cullen, the daughter of Bella Swan and Edward Cullen, at birth in Book 2 of Breaking Dawn. Jacob was initially in love with Bella, but she chose Edward and gave birth to Renesmee, a half-human, half-vampire hybrid.  As part of the imprinting, Jacob will only be a brother figure to Renesmee until she comes of age, by which time she may develop romantic feelings for him, and vice versa.  In the movies, Jacob is portrayed by Taylor Lautner and Renesmee by Mackenzie Foy.  ""The murderer stared past Rosalie's shoulder at me, its gaze more focused than any newborn creature's gaze should be.""  ""Warm brown eyes, the color of milk chocolate—the exact same color that Bella's had been.""  ""My shaking jerked to a stop; heat flooded through me, stronger than before, but it was a new kind of heat—not a burning.""  ""It was glowing.""  ""Everything that made me who I was—my love for the dead girl upstairs, my love for my father, my loyalty to my new pack, the love for my other brothers, my hatred for my enemies, my home, my name, my self—disconnected from me in that second—snip, snip, snip—and floated up into space.""  ""I was not left drifting. A new string held me where I was. Not one string, but a million. Not strings, but steel cables. A million steel cables all tying me to one thing—to the very center of the universe.""  ""I could see that now—how the universe swirled around this one point. I'd never seen the symmetry of the universe before, but now it was plain.""  ""The gravity of the earth no longer tied me to the place where I stood.""

After his mother died in a car accident and his twin sisters moved away, he became his father's only family. He phased for the first time when he was 16 years old.  He was originally in love with Renesmee's mother, Bella, and fought to win her over from her vampire boyfriend Edward Cullen. At the end of Eclipse, he tried to convince Bella that he was the better choice for her, but she chose Edward. Jacob ran away from home after receiving their wedding invitation and tried to escape his pain by living as a wolf. He returns to attend their wedding reception and nearly gets into a fight with Edward. His fellow wolves restrained him and took him away before he could phase.  When the pack found out that Bella was pregnant, their immediate reaction was to kill Bella in order to kill her baby, who they believed to be a monster at the time. Jacob broke Sam's alpha order in order to protect Bella, and Leah and Seth joined him. During her pregnancy, he continues to protect Bella from the pack. After her daughter, Renesmee is born by cesarean section, Jacob imprints on her, and is completely over Bella. After Bella is thought to be dead, the wolves attack the Cullens. Jacob stops the fight and lets Sam know that he imprinted. Due to their absolute law that forbids killing imprints, the wolves are forced to leave and declare permanent peace.

CLICK HERE if you are having a problem viewing the photos on a mobile device  In 2004, the Church of Scientology embarked on a top-secret project to find a new wife for Tom Cruise after his divorce from Nicole Kidman and the end of his relationship to actress Penelope Cruise, according to a report by Vanity Fair.  The project involved an elaborate auditioning process in which actresses were brought in to try out for a film, then asked a series of questions that included: “What do you think of Tom Cruise?”  In an interview Wednesday, a former Scientology member, who said he served on Cruise’s Scientology security detail, claims that one of the actresses who auditioned to be Cruise’s “second dynamic” was Scarlett Johansson.  While appearing on NBC’s “Megyn Kelly Today” on Wednesday, Brendan Tighe, who was born into the organization but left in 2011, said he inadvertently came across reports of women who auditioned to be in a relationship with the “Mission Impossible” actor — and one was Johansson.  The reports, by Cruise’s celebrity “handler” Tommy Davis, were mistakenly sent to Tighe’s printer, he said.  “The only name I remember was Scarlett Johansson,” Tighe told Kelly. “It was right there in the report.”  In a statement to the Hollywood Reporter, Johansson, 33, vehemently denied Tighe’s assertion.  “The very idea of any person auditioning to be in a relationship is so demeaning,” the “Avengers” actress said. “I refuse for anyone to spread the idea that I lack the integrity to choose my own relationships. Only a man aka Brendan Tighe would come up with a crazy story like that.”  But the 2012 Vanity Fair report confirms the essence of Tighe’s assertion. The story said that Cruise had attempted to entice several of beautiful, well-known women to accept his devotion to Scientology — and Johansson was one of them.  Film industry reports from 2005 also questioned why Johansson had been dropped from co-starring with Cruise in “Mission: Impossible III.”  The actress told the media at the time that she had been attached to Cruise’s film, but said “scheduling conflicts” came up. She wanted to work with Woody Allen on his 2006 film “Scoop,” after working with Allen on his critically acclaimed “Match Point.”  “When you have a big production like (“Mission: Impossible”), they can’t move stuff around that easily,” she said in an interview. “I wanted to work with Woody so, unfortunately, that was a casualty, I guess.”  But another report from 2005 suggests that there were other conflicts as well, and they had to do with Cruise’s personal interests in Johannson. Today.com, citing a report from RadarMagazine.com, said Cruise invited Johannson to the Scientology center where he showed her literature about joining his controversial self-styled religious organization.  “After two hours of proselytizing, Cruise opened a door to reveal a second room full of upper-level Scientologists who had been waiting to dine with the pair,” RadarMagazine.com reported. At that point, “the cool-headed ingénue politely excused herself,” the magazine said.  In his interview with Kelly, Tighe said he was certain he saw Johansson’s name in one of the reports from Tommy Davis.  The other thing he said about the supposed audition of Johansson is that “it didn’t go well” because she wasn’t interested in a relationship with Cruise.  As a result, another actress and known Scientology member Erika Christensen “had to disconnect from Johansson because (the audition) didn’t go well,” Tighe said. “That was in that report.”  Scientology also issued a response to Tighe’s claim regarding his association with Cruise, 55. Karin Pouw, from the Church of Scientology International, told Kelly: “Brendan Tighe was a Church of Scientology Flag Service Organization security guard/night watchman from 2002 to 2009. The ‘access’ he boasts of having was largely limited to viewing security cameras from a guard booth. He was removed from that position for dereliction of duty.”  Tighe dispute	0
One of the most stressful things that came out of the great television boom is having to explain to someone that you didn’t watch [insert über-popular show]. Not everyone has watched The Sopranos, The Wire, or Breaking Bad, but the people who have watched those shows treat having a blind spot like it’s a federal offense. Most of the time, you’re just shamed into silence. And there’s nothing more uncomfortable than being among a group of friends theorizing about Lost or something, while you nod silently and consider chiming in, even though you have no clue what they’re talking about. (“So, yeah … that polar bear, huh?”)  This week, I had my own reckoning: You see, I never watched Jersey Shore. I knew the reality series was a massive hit on MTV, and I knew what a “Snooki” and a “the Situation” was, and I kept their livers in my prayers. But I just never tuned in. And as the cast’s spray tans faded into the sunset and out of the zeitgeist, it seemed like this particular pop culture shame would never be resurfaced.  But now they’re back. On Thursday night, the Jersey Shore crew—minus Sammi, and, for a moment, Mike “the Situation” Sorrentino, who is mired in a tax evasion trial—returned for a “family vacation” to Miami (because while Floribama Shore and Winter Break: Hunter Mountain are entertaining, everyone just wants to see the thing those shows are copies of). The thing about reboots is they can be pretty good gateways for people who missed out on a particular show at the peak of its popularity—and what better time to finally see what all the Jersey Shore fuss was about? Admittedly, this undertaking was also a bit nerve-racking—enough stories about a man yelling about the arrival of taxis and a woman binge-eating ham will do that to a newbie.  But Jersey Shore Family Vacation truly surprised me. Sure, the premiere episode still featured drunken tirades, but the reunion was also a group of people reconciling with “growing up” and the cruel passage of time that nobody—not even self-described guidos and guidettes—is immune to. Snooki and JWoww each have two children; Ronnie’s first child was born this week; Vinny is skinny; and Pauly D … all right, he hasn’t really changed—still very much a DJ.  Despite being shockingly relatable, however, watching Family Vacation was still like being dropped into a strange country without any tour guide books. With the premiere in the can, here are 22 of the most pressing questions I had after my Jersey Shore experience.  1. Before the premiere even starts, we get some highlights of the entire reunion along with some obscure quotes from the cast. “Things have changed but they really haven’t changed,” Ronnie, a modern philosopher, says. Then Vinny adds: “I can’t explain it, but put us all together and it’s a shit show.” Guys, I’m completely new to this, but isn’t that all self-explanatory, and kind of the point?  2. Speaking of Ronnie, I literally can’t stop staring at this guy. How does this guy look even beefier than he did almost a decade ago? It’s like if you forced Guy Fieri to only chug creatine powder for three months and spray-tanned over his spray tan.  3. Is it more surprising that JWoww has children, or that Snooki has children? JWoww seems pretty put together for a person whose nickname includes three Ws. “The fish, don’t kill them,” JWoww proclaims to her dimwitted-looking husband, Roger, before leaving for Miami.  4. … Can we get an update on the goldfish throughout this season? I just want to be sure they’re OK and that Roger hasn’t killed them. I mean, LOOK AT THIS GUY!  Roger is a sentient bowl of chili.  5. Pretty early on, it’s become clear we’re not going to get to Miami for a while because the show is reintroducing everyone with quick life updates. And now, I know Vinny was “the relatable one,” but wow—is he the most normcore reality star of all time? The guy doesn’t have a spray tan, speaks at a normal volume, and seems to be living a healthy life out on Staten Island.  6. Wa	1
"A-Teens[1] (stylized as A★TEENS or A*Teens) were a Swedish pop music group[2] from Stockholm, Sweden, formed by Niklas Berg in 1998 as an ABBA tribute band called ABBA-Teens and later renamed A-Teens. The band members were Marie Serneholt, Amit Sebastian Paul, Dhani Lennevald and Sara Lumholdt. The band's debut album became a success around the world. In 2001, it was reported that the band had sold 6 million albums worldwide.[3]  After six years together, the band announced they would take a break in 2004 after the release of their Greatest Hits album. Each song from that album became a Top 20 hit in at least one country around the world.[4]  History [ edit ]  The ABBA Generation (1999) [ edit ]  The original logo that the band used in their early days under the original name, ABBA-Teens  In 1998, Marie, Sara, Dhani, and Amit were musically united as the ABBA-Teens. However, the group's name was changed to the A-Teens to avoid litigation.[5] This choice allowed the band more freedom in creating their own style of music.  The official A-Teens logo  In early 1999, the band started the recording process of what would be their debut album, The ABBA Generation, consisting purely of ABBA covers reinterpreted with a modern pop and electronic flair to appeal to a new generation of young pop fans. Their first single, ""Mamma Mia"", topped the charts in over ten countries including their home country Sweden where it stayed at number one for eight consecutive weeks. The album hit the peak position in Sweden & Chile and became a top ten hit throughout the world. Further singles enjoyed similar success ensuring top ten placings across the globe, and the album overall sold more than 3 million copies worldwide, being certified Gold or Platinum in over 22 different countries.[6]  The band's music video for ""Dancing Queen"" features a plot very similar to the 1985 John Hughes film The Breakfast Club. In addition, the principal seen in the music video was played by Paul Gleason, the same actor who was the principal in the film. The single reached ninety-five on the Billboard Hot 100 and sold over 500,000 copies in the U.S. alone, being certified Gold.[7]  In early 2000, the band embarked on a U.S. promotional tour, and on the verge of the release of their album in the United States, the band was invited to tour with Britney Spears that summer in her U.S. Tour. They also made several appearances on Disney and Nickelodeon to promote their music. The band's debut became a hit in North America, where the album reached seventy-one on the Billboard 200 Albums Chart being certified Gold in September 2000,[8] but its sales reached the million mark in 2001.[9]  That month, the A-Teens won a Viva Music Award for Best International Newcomer, competing with the likes of Christina Aguilera and Blink-182,[10] and also the band announced what would be the lead single from their second album and their first to be an original song, ""Upside Down"", which would also become their signature song. The song was released to Swedish radios on 23 October 2000,[11] and was later unleashed worldwide. When the single was commercially released, it reached number two in Sweden and was later certified 2x Platinum.[12] The song became the band's biggest hit when it reached the top ten in several countries and when the single was released in the United States. The physical single reached number six on the Billboard Hot 100 Single Sales Chart,[13] selling over 500,000 copies in three weeks and being certified Gold.[14] In January 2001, the band was nominated for ""Best Swedish Group"" at the NRJ Awards.[15]  Teen Spirit (2001) [ edit ]  The band's second album, entitled ""Teen Spirit"", featured a compilation of tracks that were not ABBA covers and when it was finally released on 26 February 2001, it debuted at number two in the Swedish Charts. This pop sensation hit reached the top ten in other countries and entered at number eighty-three on the World Charts,[16] number thirteen on the"	1

"Ivanka Trump issues direct condemnation of 'white supremacy and neo-nazis'  The day after deadly protests that occurred in Charlottesville, Va. following a “Unite the Right” white nationalist rally, Ivanka Trump issued a more pointed assessment of blame than her father, saying there is “no place in society for racism, white supremacy and neo-nazis.”  Ivanka Trump calling out “racism, white supremacy and neo-nazis” is the most specific language used by a member of the Trump family. Following an eruption of violence in the college town where one person was killed and 19 people were injured after a car hit protesters leaving a rally.  On Saturday afternoon, President Trump condemned the violence but blamed “many sides.”  The White House issued a statement Sunday saying ""The President said very strongly in his statement yesterday that he condemns all forms of violence, bigotry, and hatred. Of course that includes white supremacists, KKK Neo-Nazi and all extremist groups."" But the president has not used those words himself.  Republicans and Democrats criticized the president for not being more forceful in calling out white nationalists groups.  Trump “missed an opportunity to be very explicit here,"" Sen. Lindsey Graham, a Republican from South Carolina, said on Fox News Sunday.  The white nationalists “seem to believe they have a friend in Donald Trump in the White House… I would urge the president to dissuade them of the [idea] that he is sympathetic to their cause.”  “We need more from our president on this issue … it’s up to him to correct the record here,"" Graham said.  Sen. Cory Gardner, a Republican, was one of the first Republicans to say Trump needed to ""call evil by its name"" Saturday.  ""This president has done an incredible job of naming terrorism around the globe as evil., radical Islamic terrorism ... he has said and called it out time and time again and this president needs to do exactly that today, call this white supremacy, white nationalism evil,” Gardner said on CNN State of the Union Sunday. ""Let the country hear it and let the world hear it. It's something that needs to come from the Oval Office.""  “I wouldn’t have recommended that statement. I think he needed to be much harsher as it related to the white supremacists,” said Anthony Scaramucci, Trump’s former communications director, on ABC’s This Week, “It’s actually terrorism, whether it’s domestic or international terrorism with the moral authority of the presidency you have to call that stuff out.”  House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., urged the president to say ""white supremacy is an affront to American values.""  As of Sunday morning Trump had still not specifically condemned white nationalism.  ""The president has been very clear, we cannot tolerate this kind of bigotry, this kind of hatred. And what he did is he called on all Americans to take a firm stance against it,"" said Trump National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster. ""The president called out anyone who is responsible for fomenting this kind of bigotry, hatred, racism and violence. I think the president was very clear on that.""  Ivanka Trump and her husband Jared Kushner are Orthodox Jews and observe the Sabbath, which begins Friday night at sundown and runs through Saturday at sundown. During that time they do not engage in social media."	0
The 2018 MTV Movie & TV Awards was held on June 16, 2018, from the Barker Hangar in Santa Monica, California, U.S. and was broadcast on June 18, 2018.

"'Outlander' recap: Jamie and Claire reunite in a perfectly awkward, sexy episode  Spoiler alert: This post contains spoilers from Outlander Season 3 Episode 6.  Outlander knows its audience.  After five episodes with Jamie (Sam Heughan) and Claire (Caitriona Balfe) in separate times periods and zones, the Starz show finally brings the lovers back together for the sixth episode of Season 3, ""A. Malcolm."" And delivers what fans have been hoping for — a sweet, sultry reunion that mimics one of the show's best episodes (""The Wedding"" from Season 1).  ""A. Malcom"" begins as Jamie, now running a printing business that distributes treasonous pamphlets promoting the Catholic church and Scottish independence on the side, starts a typical day. A female friend, who we later learn is no lady but a madame, helps tie his cravat, and the callbacks to the early episodes begin. Her attachment to Jamie gives us flashbacks to Laoghaire, vying to take Jamie's attention away from Claire.  As Jamie continues his quaint commute and early morning at the shop, we're introduced to two more characters who give us additional flashbacks. Though we've lost Rupert and Angus, two new bumbling friends, who've crashed the night in the print shop, are poised to take their place as comedic relief.  More: Sam Heughan: 'Outlander' Season 3 is the best yet, but don't expect the same Jamie Fraser  More: 'Outlander's Sam Heughan may be the handsome, humble star of Hollywood's dreams  As he continues about his day, Jamie is stopped by Claire's voice like the Ghost of Christmas Past, fainting as he catches sight of his wife who he hasn't seen in 20 years.  It's an awkward rekindling, as one would expect, filled with pregnant pauses and timid embraces. As Jamie realizes he spilled his cup on his pants during his brief blackout, we're reminded just how unsure the lover's relationship is after so much time past.  ""Do you mind?"" Jamie says, modestly asking Claire to turn as he undresses.  ""It's alright, we are married. At least I suppose we are,"" Claire says.  Then there's that little embarrassing detail that bachelor Jamie lives in a brothel, the madame of which has come to fancy having the handsome gentleman to herself.  But the parallels to ""The Wedding"" come starkly into focus as Claire and Jamie make their way to the bedroom.  The two get to know each other again over a dinner with plenty of wine and whiskey, just as they did when they first fell in love on their wedding night. When they move to the bed, what unfolds is an all-too-real sex scene filled with accidental bumpings of heads and self-conscious worries about how time has changed their bodies.  It's a realistic portrait of what sex may look like with a long lost love — or as realistic as possible considering it's set in the 18th century setting, the time travel and all that supernatural jazz.  That's what viewers have come to expect from the show and what keeps them tuned in. The sex scenes aren't ultra glossy Hollywood renderings (though Heughan and Balfe are as hot as ever), or the forced, possibly rape-y scenarios like those of Game of Thrones.  Outlander has never been geared towards the male gaze, rather the female. And with enough plausibility as to make the fantasy seem at least somewhat plausible.  With ""A. Malcom,"" the show hit that sweet spot yet again."	1
"As her wedding to Prince Harry gets closer, bride-to-be Meghan Markle has just been given an official aide—aka a right-hand woman to help with her all things royal.  An announcement was made earlier today that a former Kensington Palace press officer, Amy Pickerill, was chosen to assist Meghan Markle, and will handle any correspondences that she receives. Additionally, she will now be an assistant private secretary in Prince Harry’s office. A spokesman from Kensington Palace said the assistant ""will be working on Meghan Markle's programme.""  As the royal wedding gets closer and closer, an assistant seems like the only natural next step as for Markle—the Suits star's has more royal duties than ever, and has already done four public engagements with Prince Harry.  Pickerill has been photographed with Markle a few times already—once during the couple's recent royal trip to Edinburgh, Scotland earlier this month, and was also seen holding a bouquet of tulips for the bride that had been given to her by a fan.  Details were released earlier this month about the upcoming nuptials, who announced their engagement in November 2017. The wedding will take place on Saturday, May 19 at 12 p.m. at St. George's Chapel in Windsor Castle.  Kensington Palace previously announced, ""Prince Harry and Ms. Meghan Markle are hugely grateful for the many good wishes they have received since announcing their engagement. They are very much looking forward to the day and to being able to share their celebrations with the public.""  See more: Lifetime Is Releasing Another Prince Harry and Meghan Movie  Besides the news released from the royal palace, fans of the bride and groom have had plenty of speculation as to other details of the wedding. Designers have already created their predictions as to what her wedding dress will look like, and we have a pretty good idea of who her bridesmaids might be."	1

bollywood  Updated: Jun 29, 2018 09:44 IST  Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas’ week-long holiday in India has come to an end as the international actor and her rumoured boyfriend left for the US on Friday. However, while the duo were here in India, they kept us enthralled with their many appearances. From her and Nick’s two dinner outing with her mother Madhu Chopra, their high profile Goa vacation and their show of love at the big fat Ambani engagement (Akash and Shloka’s engagement party was held on Thursday in Mumbai), the power duo have been trending on the internet since day 1 of their arrival.  It was in India that the duo made their relationship Instagram official -- while Nick shared a video of Priyanka as she walked towards him, simply writing ‘her’ on it, Priyanka shared a photo of her ‘favourite men’ Nick and brother Siddharth from Goa. No surprise then that speculation suggests that before August is over, we will have Nick and Priyanka engaged to each other.  Priyanka and Nick are also each other’s ‘plus one’ these days. If Nick had the Quantico star with him as he attended his cousin’s wedding, Priyanka -- looking red hot -- walked hand-in-hand with Nick at a pre-wedding bash hosted by Mukesh Ambani for son Aksha Ambani and Shloka Mehta.  Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas pose for photos at the Ambani bash.  Priyanka also hosted an intimate party for a select few of her industry friends which was attended by cousin Parineeti Chopra and Alia Bhatt. Parineeti also accompanied them to Goa. Priyanka’s mother had said then that she is still to know Nick better. A second dinner outing of the trio followed soon.  Priyanka should be in India for her next Hindi film, Bharat, which will also star Salman Khan.  Check out these pictures from their India trip:  Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas at Yauatcha restaurant BKC in Mumbai on June 22, 2018 where they met her mother, Madhu Chopra. ( Prodip Guha/ HT Photo )  Priyanka and Nick have been spotted wearing matching purity rings and sources are insistent that an official confirmation of their relationship is not far away.  Nick and Priyanka are said to have first met at Met Gala 2017 where they appeared together on the red carpet in Ralph Lauren outfits. Priyanka had dismissed reports of them being romantically involved at that time.  The rumoured couple also attended the Beauty and the Beast Live in Concert at the Hollywood Bowl a few weeks ago. In one of the pictures, the Baywatch star was seen stepping out of a car with Jonas opening the door for her.	1
Last weekend, Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas got married, and the ceremony was very beautiful indeed; honestly, it kind of made Meghan Markle and Prince Harry’s nuptials look like they took place in the service bathroom of a Wegman’s.  A musician and former member of the Jonas Brothers, Jonas met Chopra, a Bollywood actress who starred in the now-canceled ABC show Quantico, at an Oscars after-party in 2017. The two had only been publicly dating for a few months before he proposed to Chopra last August.  Details from the wedding, such as her dress (custom Ralph Lauren with a 75-foot train!), the venue (the Umaid Bhawan Palace in Jodhpur, India), and her makeup (a warm eyeshadow coupled with a subtle yet effective red stain), have captivated the internet, as has wild, totally unfounded speculation about the veracity of their relationship, culminating in a (now-deleted) post by the Cut.  Over the past few months, there’s been much buzz about the stars’ brief courtship, as well as their age difference: Chopra is 36, while Jonas is 26. There’s also been a great deal of chatter about their multi-day wedding, which was very publicly documented on the two celebrities’ Instagrams and featured references to a number of prominent brands, from Amazon to Elit Vodka.  But while the snark surrounding the Chopra/Jonas union is largely unmerited (they’re young! They’re hot! They’re talented! They’re in very public love! What’s there not to celebrate about that?), it is understandable why so many people are talking about it. Here’s what you need to know about the couple, why so many people are talking about them, and why we should all calm down and revel in the nuptials of two celebrities with an exceptionally adept knowledge of the marketing landscape.  How Priyanka Chopra and Nick Jonas met  Even in a year of short celebrity engagements, much has been made of Chopra and Jonas’s whirlwind courtship: The two were only publicly dating for a few months before reports surfaced that Jonas rented out a Tiffany store to pick out an engagement ring for Chopra.  But as we learned in a recent Vogue profile on the couple, the two have known each other for almost two years, first meeting at an Oscars after-party in 2017. (They reportedly texted for a few months before meeting in person, which will sound familiar to anyone who’s met their significant other on Tinder.) Plus, as Prachi Gupta of Jezebel notes, short engagements are fairly standard in Indian culture, making the length of Chopra and Jonas’s courtship not particularly noteworthy.  In any case, Chopra and Jonas denied reports that they were dating for a few months, even after they attended the Met Gala together in 2017. In an interview with Jimmy Kimmel, Chopra played off the couple’s public debut as a fun little gag, sort of like asking your sibling to go to prom with you.  “We were both wearing Ralph Lauren and we decided to go together. It was fun,” Chopra said at the time. “We were at the same table. I mean, we know each other so we were just like, ‘Hey let’s go together,’ and I was like, ‘Okay, let’s go together.’ And it just ended up working out.”  This coyness did not last very long. The two made numerous appearances together at highly public events, including a Dodgers game and a “Beauty and the Beast” concert at the Hollywood Bowl, before making their official public debut on social media last June. The couple took a page from the Ariana Grande-Pete Davidson playbook, featuring each other in their stories and leaving public flirty comments on each other’s photos.  Their engagement was public from the get-go  In August, rumors that Jonas had picked out an engagement ring for Chopra were confirmed when she shared photos of her Mumbai roka ceremony, a traditional Indian engagement event. The engagement party was breathlessly covered by the Indian Express, followed by an official engagement announcement: a dreamy, hazily lit photo of the couple.  This, in itself, was somewhat unusual by Holl	1
"Even by Hollywood standards, she has always been slender.  But, with her size six trousers hanging loose over her hips, and not even the hint of a curve where once there was a perfectly sculpted alabaster cleavage, it is clear that Nicole Kidman has lost a disturbing amount of weight.  Emerging from a yoga class in New York, the 36-year-old actress looked skinnier than she has ever been.  Associates say that, at 5ft 10in, she weighs only 8st 3lb.  Several friends are concerned that she is dieting and exercising more than is healthy, and others wonder what can be behind the change.  One old friend, who remarked after embracing her recently that she was nothing but skin and bone, was told with a wan smile: ""Perhaps I have been overdoing it a little.""  She certainly takes vigorous exercise.  Exercising more than is healthy  As well as her regular yoga classes near her rented penthouse in the SoHo district, she swims and jogs often.  Recently she was seen jogging in a tracksuit, hat and gloves in a temperature of 30c.  Although her defenders say they have seen her dining on sea bass, or tucking in to chocolate ice cream, there are allegedly times when she prefers vegetable smoothies to a meal.  Currently her body mass index - expressing weight in relation to height - stands at just 16.  The healthy range is 20 to 25, and doctors become concerned if it drops below 18.  She is, then, clinically underweight.  Because she is so tall, the loss of 15lb since her marriage to Tom Cruise ended two-and-a-half years ago is clearly apparent.  Her agents, however, talked last night about her being happy and healthy, and vigorously denied any suggestions of an eating disorder.  Catherine Olim, her spokesman, said: ""Nicole has always been slender. Look at American Vogue, she is glorious. I don't know what the fuss is about.""  Those protests are given credibility by a 40-page spread in the magazine she refers to, which hit newsstands this week.  But Valentino says her figure is perfect  Miss Kidman looks stunning, posing in clothes by a string of designers.  (""She has the most perfect figure,"" coos Valentino.)  Her influence in the fashion world is so great that she is shortly to be unveiled as the international face of Chanel No 5 perfume.  In media terms, she has blossomed since splitting from Cruise; it is fair to say that she has never been in such demand.  But the question many are asking is why Nicole, who has relocated to New York with her two adopted children, Conor and Isabella, is looking so tired and nervy?  And why, they are wondering in Italy, has she pulled out of the Venice film festival?  And why, they wonder in Hollywood, has she turned down a £10million payday - the biggest of her career - to star in a film opposite Brad Pitt?  There are signs that Nicole - who said in the spring that she feared a ""burnout"" - is under a considerable amount of pressure, both emotional and professional.  She is still alone, despite a fling with rap star Q-Tip and a flirtation with rock star Lenny Kravitz, from whom she is renting a penthouse while her own pad in the city is renovated.  Her romantic friendship with Russell Crowe has foundered, and he has now married his on-off girlfriend Danielle, who is expecting a baby.  How painful this must be for Nicole, who longs to have a baby herself.  Overwhelmed with grief after miscarriage  She was, by her own admission, almost overwhelmed by grief when she had a miscarriage only six weeks after her marriage to Cruise ended.  Those who know her best say that she is still puzzling over the wreckage of that marriage and trying to come to terms with the feelings of abandonment and rejection which resulted.  ""I don't think two people could have been happier than Tom and I,"" she mused.  I was desperate to have a baby with Tom  ""He swept me off my feet and I fell madly, passionately in love. I was consumed by it. And I was desperate to have a baby with him. That's what I wish I'd done.""  Her vulnerable state o"	0

Could The Weeknd be heading for retirement? It’s almost September, and in the magazine world, this is the time to reveal the biggest covers of this year.  Usually, the Harper’s Bazaar cover has featured female models, singers, and stars.  A post shared by The Weeknd (@theweeknd) on Aug 3, 2017 at 9:41am PDT  But this year, the Grammy-winning artist The Weeknd ‘Earned It.’  Posing in all black, the singer is surrounded by A-list models Adriana Lima and Irina Shayk.  Because this is the 2017 Icons issue, the feature, photographed by Brigitte Lacombe, will also showcase stars such as Miranda Lambert, Travis Scott, Candice Swanepoel and Karlie Kloss.  The Weeknd, who is dressed in Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello, opened up to Harper’s Bazaar giving a simple explanation for his mystique and the future of his career.  He confessed to the magazine that he is not at all in a rush to let people know everything that there is to know about him.  He even gives his identity a sense of mystery through his stage name, as his real name is Abel Tesfaye.  ‘Luckily, the only thing the world demands of me is music’ says the musician. ‘I don’t have to give them anything else for the rest of my life.’  PUMAXO || PARALLELS || 8.24 A post shared by The Weeknd (@theweeknd) on Jul 26, 2017 at 2:20pm PDT  He has more than 14 million followers on Instagram, and he revealed the magazine that he would consider retiring from his stage name.

Maybe I’ll retire from being The Weeknd.’ He quickly backtracks, giving hope that there’s still more to come: ‘maybe I’ll just give him a break.’ Whatever he decides on doing in the future we wish him all the best!	1
With first-time nominations come main, purple-carpet moments.  And you may guess Margot Robbie won’t disappoint.  The actress, lauded for her flip as Tonya Harding in I, Tonya, can be one to observe this award season. The Australian actress by no means ceases to shock—she’ll present as much as one purple carpet in a Victorian-esque, excessive-neck floral robe after which to a different in an ensemble that masterfully mixes each leather-based and elaborations. Thus far, she doesn’t appear to favor one designer over one other, which makes her so enjoyable to comply with. She will put on something!  Earlier as we speak, Robbie earned a Golden Globe nomination, going up towards Judi Dench, Helen Mirren, Saiorse Ronan and Emma Stone.	1
Julianna Margulies and George Clooney played one of the most loved couples on TV on ER (as nurse Carol Hathaway and Dr. Doug Ross.) Now, it looks like the actress is looking back at those years with the same fondness the fans do.  The star revealed that it was Clooney who taught her to respect everybody on set.  Margulies was in attendance at the American Film Institute’s Life Achievement Award Gala that honored Clooney earlier in the week, and while there, she shared with ET a story from the set of the medical drama.  She recalled Clooney shutting down a diva guests star.  ‘I remember that it was a guest star who was … they were upset, and they were keeping all of us waiting while in their trailer. And we were on set waiting and when they came on I was just watching, and George said, ‘You know, you keep all of us waiting. The crew actually does not get to go home to see their families. So that is what that little tantrum was.’ And I was like, ‘Nice!’ never happened again.’  The actress went on to praise her fellow actor, even more, talking about how ‘lucky’ she was to work with him.  Advertisement  ‘We loved working together. We were good together. We could finish each other’s sentences. It was easy. His body of work really speaks for itself. He knows so much about the business and yet has never, ever gotten jaded by it. He’s truly noble. He treats every single person alike on the set it, does not matter their job title… Yeah, he taught me everything,’ she gushed.	1

Brandi Glanville does not believe Omarosa Manigault never slept with her former boss, President Donald Trump. As previously reported, during Celebrity Big Brother, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills alum asked Omarosa straight out — completely shocking the former political aide — if she had ever slept with Trump.  “Hell no,” the former Apprentice star replied during the February 16 episode. “Oh, my God. Brandi, that’s horrible!”  However, Glanville, 45, didn’t buy it! During an appearance on E!’s Daily Pop on Thursday, March 8, she was asked if she thought Omarosa was being honest.  “Nope, I don’t think so. Like how would they have that relationship for so long and he just keeps bringing her back,” she explained, adding that Omarosa also took a “moment” to pause before answering. “I don’t know … I’ve heard a lot of rumors, but listen, you never know what’s true. But I needed to know.”  Omarosa appeared on Trump’s first season of The Apprentice in 2004 and again on the show in 2008. She went on to join Trump’s administration in January 2017, working in the White House for just under a year before resigning in December. She joined Celebrity Big Brother to “adjust her image,” Glanville recently told Us Weekly.  “I didn’t mind her. In the end, I liked her, but it was very clear to me, and I think to most people, that she was there to do a PR campaign, to change a conversation and adjust her image,” the reality star told Us after she was eliminated from the show. “That said, she has the temper of most, like myself!”  Glanville also told Us that her Real Housewives costars “couldn’t handle” Omarosa. “They get in a fight over diamond earrings that might not be three carats … no,” she said.

“ People are at their best, or worst, when they have an opportunity to touch greatness. I should know – I've been both. — Cyrus to Liam [src] ”    Prince Cyrus Henstridge is a character in the E! drama soap The Royals. He is the primary antagonist in season 1. He was temporarily the King of England after the death of his older brother, the late King Simon. He is portrayed by actor Jake Maskall.  Contents show]  Character Edit  Cyrus is the second son of the previous King and Queen of England and the younger brother of Simon Henstridge. Cyrus married and later divorced Veruca Pomperwell, Duchess of Essex, who gave him twin daughters, Princess Maribel and Princess Penelope.  Cyrus has always wanted to be King - a role his older brother assumed after the death of their father. Cyrus is very power hungry aligning himself with Queen Helena to get that power. He is the polar opposite of his older brother Simon. He wants to be the next on the throne.  Season 1 Edit  It starts out with Robert's funeral and we see Eleanor accusing Cyrus of being happy that Robert is dead which means there are less people in line for the throne.

Later on, Cyrus came onto Prudence, which she rebuffed, but he threatens her job if she does not perform sexual acts on him.

"Blac Chyna will go head-to-head against the Kardashian family in court in 2020, her lawyer, Walter Mosley, announced on Monday.  ""February 3, 2020 ... We’re going to court ... White v. Kardashian et al. #staytuned #blacchyna,"" Mosely wrote on Instagram, alongside a photo of him with Chyna, 30.  After Instagram users responded with negative comments, Mosley clapped back at one who had replied, ""Shame in the both of u. Signed: Karma.""  KARDASHIANS' ATTORNEY FIRES BACK AT BLAC CHYNA LAWSUIT CLAIMS  ""Just doing my job here. There is no shame in being a lawyer,"" Mosley responded.  This prompted the user to try and further attack Mosley. ""There are children involved,"" the user wrote. ""Shame on you for partaking in her mess. And making a scene of it all. Posting this on IG. Is for clout. So please miss me with your terrible lawyer talk.""  ""You do realize Kylie and Rob sued Chyna first … refused to serve her through her lawyer and instead did a public serving to embarrass her,"" Mosley replied. ""Just make sure you’re ‘keeping up'. This is just a counter suit … so let's talk about the kids why don’t we.""  Blac has a 2-year-old daughter, Dream, from her rocky relationship with Rob Kardashian.  THE BIGGEST KARDASHIAN-JENNER MOMENTS OF 2018  During their time together, the couple starred in an E! reality series, Rob and Chyna, and in October 2017, Blac filed a lawsuit against Rob, as well as Kris Jenner, Kim Kardashian West, Khloe Kardashian and Kylie Jenner, claiming they hurt her career by canceling the series.  According to Chyna's lawsuit, the ""Kardashian-Jenner family became media predators, slut-shaming her on social media and killing her hit television show ['Rob & Chyna']"" as a form of ""revenge"" for leaving her relationship with Rob. The suit also alleged that Rob verbally and physically assaulted Blac.  Rob has denied the assault allegations, and in December 2017, the Kardashian family's attorneys filed a demurrer, which challenged the basis of Blac's lawsuit and asked for a dismissal of her case.  Last month, Blac’s attorney, Lisa Bloom, claimed victory after writing on Twitter that the court had ""rejected the Kardashian family's request to strike Chyna's entire lawsuit.""  ROB KARDASHIAN HAS 'TURNED HIS LIFE AROUND' FOLLOWING 'LIFE OR DEATH' ULTIMATUM, SOURCE SAYS  However, at the time the Kardashians' attorney, Shawn Holley, told ET that the reality television clan had “successfully chipped away at Ms. White’s outlandish claims since her lawsuit was filed, culminating in today’s hearing -- a hearing at which the Court invited counsel for the Kardashians to seek attorney fees against the Bloom Firm for their failure to support Ms. White’s spurious allegations with actual evidence.""  Meanwhile, a source recently told ET that Rob was turning his life around, and has made his health and Dream a priority while living at one of Kylie's houses."	1
"Netflix original series  For the original 2003 television series on Bravo, see Queer Eye  Queer Eye is an American Netflix original series, initially released on February 7, 2018. It is a reboot of the Bravo series of the same name, featuring a new Fab Five: Antoni Porowski, food and wine expert; Tan France, fashion expert; Karamo Brown, culture expert; Bobby Berk, design expert; and Jonathan Van Ness, grooming expert. In July 2018, the series was renewed for a third season, which was released on March 15, 2019. In June 2019, Netflix renewed the series for a fourth and fifth season. The fourth season was released on July 19, 2019.  Main cast [ edit ]  Makeover (""make better"") experts known collectively as the Fab Five:  Production [ edit ]  Creator credit is given to David Collins. In contrast to the original series which was filmed in the New York area, seasons one and two of the reboot were filmed in Atlanta and neighboring Georgia towns. After Netflix announced that the series had been renewed for a third season,[1] local media outlets reported that the show was casting in Kansas City, Missouri.[2] Filming began in Kansas City on June 16, 2018, with the third season having premiered on March 15, 2019.[1][3]  David Collins has said that he is interested in filming a season of Queer Eye in the Midwest, and that he would like to bring the Fab Five to his hometown, Cincinnati, Ohio: ""I'm from Cincinnati, Ohio, born and raised. I would like to go the tristate region, Ohio, Indiana, and Kentucky, because you can base in Cincinnati and go across the bridge to Kentucky and go up the interstate to Indiana. The corn-fed midwestern folk are where I'm from—and I love actually being from Ohio, it's a great place to be from.""[4] The Fab Five later voiced fictionalized versions of themselves in adult animated series, Big Mouth.[5]  Release [ edit ]  All eight episodes of the first series were released on Netflix on February 7, 2018. Netflix's provided maturity rating is TV-14.  The series was renewed for a second season that aired on June 15, 2018.[6] Speaking to Variety, interior design expert Bobby Berk stated that season 2 was filmed at the tail end of season one.[7] The season features a new theme song by Betty Who.[8] The season includes an episode focused on a man named Skyler[9] who is transgender.[10] Other makeover heroes include a Walmart employee, a young musician, a mayor, a woman, and a man trying to graduate college.[8][9]  On June 6, 2018 it was reported that an episode was being filmed in the town of Yass, New South Wales in Australia. Yass was chosen due to the fact that ""its name matches one of the boys' favourite sayings: yaass"".[11] On June 21, 2018, the 20-minute Yass episode was released online.[12]  On June 18, 2019, the series was renewed for a fourth and fifth season.[13] The fourth season was released on July 19, 2019.[14] A four–episode special season called Queer Eye: We're in Japan! was released on November 1, 2019.

E! on Monday revealed the top five finalists in each category of the newly minted E! People’s Choice Awards (airing Sunday, November 11 at 9/8c).  All told, Grey’s Anatomy and Shadowhunters lead the field with five nominations a piece. Fellow scripted series 13 Reasons Why and Riverdale are close behind (with four nominations each), followed by The Big Bang Theory and This Is Us (with three nominations each).  Of Grey’s Anatomy‘s five nominations, two are for leading lady Ellen Pompeo (who is nominated for both Drama TV Star and Female TV Star), while another two are for the series itself (which is nominated for both TV Show and the more specific Drama TV Show category).  If we may take a moment to nitpick, the Revival Show category doesn’t pay any mind to the actual definition of “revival.” Nominees include reboots One Day at a Time and Dynasty, which are in no way continuations of the original series on which they’re based, and therefore, not. reboots. (Sigh.)  Online voting for the PCAs remains open through Friday, October 19 at 11:59 pm ET.

Rob Kardashian is absolutely tickled by the idea of Blac Chyna as a rapper after reports came out that she signed a record deal. Now, he can’t stop laughing!  We must admit, we were a little surprised when we heard that Blac Chyna, 29, may have signed a record contract. However, her ex Rob Kardashian, 30, was a million times more shocked! But the more he thinks about it, the more hilarious he thinks it is. Click here to see pics of Rob and Blac’s final blowout fight.  “Rob has had some major laughs thinking about Blac Chyna trying to rap,” an insider told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “And even if she goes after Rob in her raps he thinks she will be so bad that it won’t matter because she will just be embarrassing herself. He is actually kind of looking forward to see her fail and thinks she will be even worse than K-Fed.” Yikes! We all remember the cringe-worthy song by Britney Spears’ ex Kevin Federline, “Popozao.” The world doesn’t need a repeat of THAT atrocity.  The reason rumors exploded that Blac would be trying her hand at the rap game is because she was spotted walking into Capital Records with her lawyer, and MTO reports that they offered her a $1 million recording deal. Perhaps she’s become inspired by her pal Nicki Minaj, who recently rapped about her on the track “Rake It Up,” and even invited her to be in the music video! We have no idea how good Blac would be at rapping, but we certainly would be interested to hear it, ESPECIALLY if she spills the tea on her split with Rob in a diss track!  HollywoodLifers, what do you think of Rob’s response to Blac trying to rap? Is he right, or just downright rude? Let us know!	0
Paris Jackson is in the holiday spirit and shared a rare photo with her two brothers, Prince Jackson, 20, and Blanket Jackson, 15, on Christmas Day.  “Happy Christmas from ours to yours #brahdas,” Paris captioned the photo, which also includes their family friend, Omer Bhatti. It’s unclear when the photo was taken and if all three siblings spent the holidays together.  Blanket, who continues to sport long black hair, has rarely been seen in public since his father, Michael Jackson, died in 2009. Meanwhile, his two older siblings have taken to social media over the years to connect with fans.  On Saturday, Prince shared a few silly snaps of himself while traveling through Switzerland.  Paris also shared new photos of her travels on Monday, where it appears she’s enjoying a tropical getaway.  For more on the Jackson family, watch the video below.

Brad Pitt has fans buzzing about his alleged new romance with Neri Oxman, a beautiful college professor. While some are thrilled, Angelina Jolie is struggling over the fact that he may have moved on for good.  Angelina Jolie, 42, isn’t too fond of the rumors claiming Brad Pitt, 54, is dating Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor, Neri Oxman, 42. In fact, “Angelina is steaming with emotions and jealousy,” a source close to the actress tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “She doesn’t like to hear any of the dating rumors about her ex… She can‘t handle it.”  For the first time ever, or at least in a while, Angie has found herself a bit intimidated, which the insider says, does not happen often with the actress. “Angie saw pictures of Neri and felt a bit jealous. It’s Neri‘s incredible intelligence that has thrown Angie off balance,” the source admits, explaining, “An MIT professor is the last person Angie would have picked for Brad. Instead, “Angie might feel more comfortable if her ex were dating another Hollywood actress.”  Another thing that’s “unnerved” Angie is that many people are comparing her to Oxman in terms of looks. “She’s hearing that people think she looks like Neri and the whole thing is weird and uncomfortable for Angie,” the insider admits.  As Brad’s love life has taken over the news, Angie can’t help but be a witness to it all. However, “Angelina is also in a bit of denial about Brad‘s possible new relationship,” the source reveals. Why? — “She knows Neri is not Brad’s type, or at least doesn’t fit into his group of ex’s.”	0

"Philippa Charlotte Matthews[4] (née Middleton; born 6 September 1983)[5][6] is an English socialite, author, and columnist. The younger sister of the Duchess of Cambridge, she began receiving media attention with her appearance as the maid of honour at her sister's wedding to Prince William.  Early life [ edit ]  Pippa Middleton was born at Royal Berkshire Hospital in Reading, Berkshire, England. She is the second of three children born to Michael Middleton (born 1949), a former British Airways flight dispatcher, and Carole Middleton (née Goldsmith; born 1955), a former flight attendant.[7][8] She was christened at St Andrew's Bradfield, Berkshire.[9]  Education [ edit ]  In 1995, her family moved to Bucklebury, Berkshire.[10][11] Like her sister, Middleton was first educated at St Andrew's School, a private boarding school in Pangbourne and then Downe House School, a girls' day and boarding school in Cold Ash. She was a boarder at Marlborough College, where she held a sports/all-rounder scholarship.[12][13] Middleton then graduated from the University of Edinburgh with an English literature degree,[14] where she shared a house with Lord Edward Innes-Ker, a son of the Duke of Roxburghe, and with Earl Percy, heir apparent of the Duke of Northumberland.[14]  Career [ edit ]  Following her graduation, Middleton briefly worked in 2008 at a public relations firm promoting luxury products. She then had an events management job with Table Talk, a company based in London that organises corporate events and parties.[12][15] In 2008, Tatler magazine named Middleton ""the Number 1 Society Singleton"", ahead of singer-songwriter James Blunt and Princess Eugenie of York,[16] although in the same Tatler article she was described as someone who ""goes to a lot of parties, but mainly as the caterer."" Since then, she has often been described as a socialite.[17] As part of a duo with her elder sister, Middleton has received wide press coverage, focusing on her social life and her lifestyle. In April 2012, Time magazine listed Middleton as one of the 100 most influential people in the world.[18]  Middleton has worked part-time for her parents' company Party Pieces, editing the web magazine Party Times.[12][19]  Penguin Books paid Middleton a £400,000 advance for a book on party planning. The book, entitled Celebrate, was published in autumn 2012, and had lower than anticipated sales as many reviewers mocked it for the obviousness of its content.[20][21] In March 2013, Middleton parted from her literary agent.[22]  The 2016 ITV documentary, Our Queen At 90, revealed that a recipe which featured in Middleton's Celebrate book – Granny's Marrow Chutney – had been made by her sister, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, who gave a jar of it as a Christmas gift to her grandmother-in-law, Queen Elizabeth II, in 2011.[23]  Middleton is also a regular columnist for several publications. She has contributed articles to The Spectator magazine since December 2012[24] and began having a food column in the supermarket magazine Waitrose Kitchen beginning in spring 2013.[25] In June 2013 she was named a contributing editor of Vanity Fair writing a series of columns for the magazine.[26] Beginning in September 2013, Middleton also wrote a fortnightly sports and social column for The Sunday Telegraph.[27] She parted ways from The Telegraph in May 2014.  In May 2013, she became the sole director and shareholder of PXM Enterprises Limited.[28] The company is headquartered at 19 Portland Place in London.[28]  In September 2016, Middleton's iPhone was hacked. The Sun reported it had been approached by a hacker who claimed to have 3,000 images from Middleton's iCloud account and demanded £50,000 for them. The hacker was arrested that same month.[29]  Royal wedding [ edit ]  Middleton stands with the Royal Family as maid of honour at the wedding of her sister and Prince William, as Prince Philip looks on  The official announcement of her sister's engagement came on 16 Novembe"	1
"""Esmeralda mostly speaks Spanglish right now. It’s really cute,"" Mendes said about their three year old daughter.

My mom, who lives 15 minutes away, makes it is easy because she speaks to the girls in Spanish and cooks them Cuban food. And we’re always listening to Cuban music.

    Kim Kardashian and Kanye West were victims of an intruder who entered their property through the front gate of their mansion in Bel Air on Friday, October 20, the Los Angeles Police Department confirms to Us Weekly. The suspect did not enter their home.  “A witness observed a suspect enter and exit the victim’s vehicle and then flee the location,” an LAPD PIO tells Us. “A second suspect who was hiding in some bushes also fled the location. Suspect No. 1 took personal items from the victim’s vehicle.”  The cars did not belong to Kardashian or West. However, some of their staff’s vehicles were on the property at the time. The suspect entered through the front gate at the end of the long driveway.  A source tells Us, “The second their private armed security guards noticed the intruder, they came out with guns drawn and flash lights out. The person turned around and ran away for their lives.”  According to TMZ, which was first to report the news, the perpetrator also trashed a car in the driveway of the couple’s neighbor Kathy Griffin. He reportedly stole the comedian’s purse before ditching it nearby. The burglaries occurred just one day after $50,000 worth of purses and sunglasses were stolen from Mariah Carey‘s mansion in L.A., according to TMZ.  The burglary at Kardashian and West’s home came one year after she was robbed at gunpoint in Paris. As previously reported, a group of armed men broke into the 36-year-old reality star’s hotel room and stole more than $10 million worth of jewelry. Ten people were charged in connection with the crime.  Kardashian opened up about the harrowing experience in an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians earlier this month. “Ever since Paris, I just go through this worst case scenario mode in my head,” she explained.	0
Share this article:  Star magazine’s new cover claims “Kim & Kanye’s $1 billion divorce announcement” is full of made-up or quotes and conjecture.  And: “To the shock of no one, the lemmings at Hollywood Life have already picked up this false report.”  So says Gossip Cop, the celebrity hoax-busting site, which also said of Hollywood Life: We’ll be on the look-out for them to flip-flop with the ‘truth’ in the coming days.”  Posted Wednesday, the story by Shari Weiss focuses on a cover quote supposedly from Kim Kardashian that “I’ll raise our surrogate baby alone.”  The source of the comment in Star is unidentified, however.  “It’s actually the alleged source speculating, ‘She would be completely fine raising the baby alone.’ That has a far different implication than what readers are told on the cover,” Weiss writes.  The Hollywood Life story by Samantha Wilson begins: “This is so sad! Kim Kardashian, 37, is reportedly at her wits end when it comes to dealing with husband Kanye West, 40. She’s struggled since Kanye’s terrifying November 2016 breakdown, and she reportedly can’t see a light at the end of the tunnel, according to an insider who spoke to Star Magazine.”  Predicting a Kim-Kanye divorce is a cottage industry, as previous stories show:  Kim kardasian had many opportunities to divorce Kanye, she is trying extremely hard to make her marriage work.

"LONDON — It had been a magical mystery tour as Paul McCartney led James Corden through his hometown of Liverpool during a ""Carpool Karaoke "" segment on CBS' ""The Late Late Show.""  Thursday's program wraps up a weeklong stay in London and the 76-year-old Beatles legend joined Corden for a drive.

As stars made their way from the red carpet to the Costume Institute’s new exhibition, “Manus x Machina,” Vogue challenged some of the Met Gala’s most-followed guests to strut their stuff inside our futuristic Instagram portrait studio. For a few glorious hours, fluorescent lights pulsed, flickered, and reflected off the night’s most jeweled and shimmering fashion.  It’s a testament to the gala’s tech-tinged theme that each guest seemed to come alive inside the lighted space. Siblings Jaden and Willow Smith performed an impromptu dance-off. Léa Seydoux followed with a leggy number so good, it compelled Willow to say to the French actress: “I just want to tell you that you’re beautiful, and I love you.” And Madonna, dressed in a Givenchy bodysuit, clung to the walls and slithered to the ground as Riccardo Tisci applauded from the sidelines. “That was your cardio!” Tisci cheered. The Balmain army—Cindy Crawford, Joan Smalls, Jourdan Dunn, Doutzen Kroes, and Alessandra Ambrosio—assembled in rhinestone frocks and put on their best faces. “My daughter is going to be so embarrassed by that,” Crawford quipped on her way out.  Even the most reserved guests took to twirling, laughing, and sashaying for the camera. Elle Fanning whipped her hair back and forth so enthusiastically, she had to run to the loo to fix her ponytail. But sometimes less is more. Just take a look at Vogue’s Editor in Chief, Anna Wintour, who mesmerized while remaining perfectly still.	1
Caitlyn Jenner lives on the outer edges of Malibu, up a winding, tree-lined road leading to a modern mountaintop home. Her yellow Labrador, Bertha, happily skips across the white tile floors of her living room. The kitchen is pristine, with a refrigerator stocked with bottles of water and a counter holding a platter of chocolate-chip cookies and a bowl of M&Ms.  The world’s most famous transgender woman has retreated from the public spotlight that once engulfed her and the hounding paparazzi who once tracked her every move. In her first lengthy sit-down magazine interview in more than a year, Jenner speaks with Variety about her conscious choice to focus, unheralded, on being a behind-the-scenes advocate for transgender rights on Capitol Hill.  “I don’t do a lot of media. I don’t want to be seen everywhere,” the 68-year-old Jenner says on a recent afternoon, her bare feet up on a lounge chair. “Today, I’m very politically involved. Nobody really knows it. I do it very quietly because I have been so criticized by the liberal side of the media. I can get more things done if I don’t stick my nose into everything publicly.”  Jenner’s low-key lifestyle and muted public profile stand in sharp contrast to the days when her much-talked-about 2015 interview with Diane Sawyer, in which she revealed plans to transition from a man to a woman, attracted a staggering 17 million viewers. Next came the cover of Vanity Fair and her own reality TV show, “I Am Cait.”  Her newfound fame put enormous pressure on Jenner — who had lived the first 65 years of her life as Olympic gold medal-winning decathlete Bruce Jenner — to be the perfect transgender role model. She had difficulty living up to those expectations, especially after coming out as something more controversial than being transgender: a Republican in Hollywood. On her reality show, Jenner expressed support for Ted Cruz and sparred with activists, who were as experienced in trans-politics as she was unversed. She voted for Trump in the 2016 election (but is no longer a fan).  Her conservatism made her a pariah in the left-leaning entertainment industry, where she’s been criticized for not doing enough to help the transgender community. Jenner spoke candidly with Variety about the pain of that rejection.  “No matter what you say or do, they think you don’t get it because you’re this kind of white, privileged person,” says Jenner. She disputes the notion that she hasn’t worked hard, or that her wealth disqualifies her from being an advocate. “I haven’t turned my back on anybody,” she says. But Jenner has received a cold shoulder from some of her peers: “I’ve felt it big time, and it hurts. Sometimes this community can be really tough.”  Jenner, who briefly considered running for senator, decided she could be more useful fighting for trans rights as a Republican liaison on Capitol Hill. She likens the civil rights battle to what the gay community faced 40 years ago on the road to marriage equality.  Every few weeks, Jenner travels to Washington to tell her story. She’s held long meetings with members of Trump’s White House and roughly 50 members of the House and Senate — to personally make the case for equality.  She’s patiently endured invasive questions about her body and genitalia, all in an effort to change people’s minds.  She says that these meetings are conducted away from the cameras. “I met with Paul Ryan,” she says. “I’ve met with just about everybody. Publicly, they aren’t supportive of transgender rights.” What do they say to her? “I’ve never had anybody not be nice to my face,” says Jenner, who did not want to elaborate on conversations that were confidential.  Margaret Hoover, the president of the American Unity Fund, a Republican-funded group that advocates for LGBTQ rights, says that Jenner is uniquely positioned to educate. “Think of your average Republican in Washington,” Hoover says, noting that the party is getting older and less diverse. “It’s basically like every white 	0
Talk about a True transformation! Khloé Kardashian says she has lost 33 lbs in the three months since she gave birth to daughter True, her first child, on April 12.  In a post on her official app, the 34-year-old reality star credited a “combination of breastfeeding and being very active” for the impressive weight loss.  Mommy’s Little Love A post shared by Khloé (@khloekardashian) on May 26, 2018 at 2:13pm PDT  “After I had True, I didn’t put any pressure on myself to lose the baby weight,” Kardashian wrote. “I just wanted to get back to my regular routine from before I got pregnant, which was working out five to six times a week.”  Then Kardashian got down to specifics: “Here is where I am at currently. True turned 3 months old on July 12. I honestly didn’t give myself a number that I wanted to lose by this time, especially since I wasn’t able to work out for the first six weeks. But, since then, I’ve lost 33 pounds! I’m shocked that I lost that much weight that quickly. I’m chalking this up to the combination of breastfeeding and being very active during and after my pregnancy.”  Shortly after she and boyfriend Tristan Thompson welcomed True, the Good American founder resumed workouts with her trainer, Joel “Coach Joe” Bouraïma, and she recently slammed speculation she was on a “ridiculous” post-baby diet.  And in her latest post, Kardashian emphasized the role of exercise in her life while asserting that not all mothers need to be such gym devotees. “I never compare myself to other women as every woman has their own journey. We also all have different priorities in our day-to-day lives. One of mine is having that one hour where I can be selfish and alone in my place of refuge,” she wrote.  “Staying healthy and active is something that’s very important to me,” she added. “Exercise is something I’ve always used to maintain my sanity and relieve stress. And, now that I have a baby, I still want to keep something that’s my time, my space, something I’m doing for myself.”	1

"Kris Jenner and Caitlyn Jenner put aside their differences to co-parent their daughters, Kendall and Kylie, according to a new report. The former couple separated in 2013 and were reportedly not on good terms following the split, but things seem to have improved slightly since then.  “Kris and Caitlyn interact when they have to for the kids,” an insider told People. “It’s important for Kylie and Kendall. They can be cordial, but like most exes, they’re never going to be best friends.”  Earl Gibson III Getty Images  As People points out, the family of four has reunited on several occasions, including Kylie's 21st birthday party earlier this month. ""It wasn’t a happy, laughing interaction between Kris and Caitlyn,"" a source told the site. ""It was more like, this is a moment where we’re coming together for the kids. It was very brief.""  Caitlyn, who is said to have a strained relationship with stepdaughter Kim Kardashian, was seen in the KKW Beauty mogul's Snapchat story during Kylie's birthday.  Although the cameo hinted that the two are now on amicable terms, a source told People that Kim, Kourtney, and Khloé ignored Caitlyn at the celebration.  “Things are still frosty between them,” the insider said. “There are too many hurt feelings between Kris and Caitlyn and the older girls.”  Despite the friction between Caitlyn and Kim, Caitlyn and Kanye West seem to be on speaking terms. The rapper (and Kim's husband) recently tweeted a screenshot of texts he received from Jenner, where she thanked him for sending Yeezy looks to her rumored girlfriend Sophia Hutchins.  ""So awesome.

"Baby number two has arrived for Victoria's Secret Angel Candice Swanepoel and her fiancé Hermann Nicoli. The gorgeous duo welcomed their second son in Brazil this week. Swanepoel posted a sneak peak of their new bundle of joy on her Instagram Stories today—holding her baby's tiny hand with the text ""blessed"" on the photo.  Courtesy @angelcandices  Swanepoel posted an Instagram on Monday sharing the excitement they were feeling. ""Hoping to meet our newest addition soon!"" she captioned a pregnancy shot of herself with her first son, 1-year-old Anaca. The South African wore unbuttoned, ripped denim jeans, and a white crocheted bra top, showing off her bump. Swanepoel and family have spent the last few months in Brazil, her fiance's native country, while they've awaited the new addition to their family.

"Heather Locklear was arrested on Sunday night for battery against a police officer and emergency personnel, law enforcement officials told Fox News.  The Ventura County Sheriff's Office said they responded to a 911 call at Locklear's home shortly after 11 p.m. PT. Locklear appeared ""heavily intoxicated"" and was ""arguing with other subjects at the residence.""  ""The responding deputy believed it was necessary to separate her from the others,"" a spokesperson for the police department told Fox News. ""In the process of trying to separate her, she battered the deputy...There was no injury to the deputy. That action caused her to get arrested.""  CLICK HERE TO LISTEN TO THE 911 CALL  Due to her ""behavior and level of intoxication,"" police called an ambulance to check on Locklear, who is 56.  LOCKLEAR'S FRIENDS, FAMILY 'DESPERATELY' TRIED TO HELP ACTRESS BEFORE HOSPITALIZATION  Locklear then proceeded to allegedly kick an EMT, who was attempting to put her on a gurney, in the chest. She was then taken to the hospital to be examined before being taken to jail where she spent the night before posting $20,000 bail at 9:10 a.m. PST.  She is expected in court for a hearing on August 23.  A rep for Locklear did not return Fox News' request for comment.  Locklear's latest arrest comes just days after the actress was released following a three-day hold in a hospital psych ward.  The actress was hospitalized on June 17, after she threatened to kill herself and was held on a 5150 call, in which a person can be held for 72 hours against their will for evaluation and treatment.  The former ""Melrose Place"" actress was also arrested in February on charges of domestic violence and assault on three police officers. She checked herself into a treatment facility in March to help with her battle with addiction.  LOCKLEAR'S EX JACK WAGNER SAYS HE HOPES ACTRESS CAN 'TURN LIFE AROUND' AFTER HOSPITALIZATION  A decade ago, in 2008, Locklear had been arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence. However, those charges were later dismissed and she was sentenced to three years of informal probation and ordered to pay a $700 fine.  Locklear is best known for appearing on ""Dynasty"" and ""T.J. Hooker"" in the 1980s and ""Melrose Place"" in the 1990s."	1

Have you been hearing a lot about facial mists, setting sprays, and primer sprays lately and wondering what all the hype is about? Many women swear by spritzing their face with these types of products for a variety of reasons. Depending on which one you use, a facial mist, setting spray, or primer spray can help to perk up tired-looking skin, set your makeup, prep your skin for face makeup, or provide an additional boost of hydration—which can be particularly helpful if you have dry skin. But generally, all skin types can reap the benefits of a facial mist or setting spray. Ready to add one to your beauty routine? Keep reading to find out more about what they can do!  WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN DIFFERENT FACE SPRAYS AND MISTS?  Wondering what exactly the difference is between all of the types of face sprays we’ve mentioned already? Facial mists are generally designed to help provide skin with a little boost of hydration, giving you an instantly refreshed feeling. Toss one in your purse or leave one at your desk—refreshing facial mists are about to become your skin’s new BFF! Setting sprays are typically used to help makeup last longer and pull your look together. Sick of your makeup always sliding off halfway through the day? It’s time to invest in a setting spray! Primer sprays are similar in that they can extend the life of your makeup, but they’re meant to be used in place of a regular old makeup primer. If you’re looking for a way to speed up your routine, a primer spray could be the way to go!  Now you have an idea of what each type of spray does, but if you aren’t sure which deserves a spot in your routine, keep reading! We’re breaking down when to reach for each one, plus, how to use them.  ADD A FACIAL MIST TO YOUR BEAUTY ROUTINE IF…  A facial mist is the perfect addition to your daily routine when you need a midday pick-me-up! In movies, you often see people splashing water on their faces to help jolt them awake. But that doesn’t sound too enjoyable, now does it? Instead, reach for a mist with a refreshing formula and spritz it on anytime you need a wakeup call throughout the day.  Even if you’re feeling totally fresh-faced and well-rested, a facial mist can also come in handy when your skin is feeling a little dry. A quick misting can give dry skin the extra boost it needs. This is particularly helpful during those cold, winter months when skin tends to get dull.  HOW TO USE A FACIAL MIST  We promise: It’s so easy! Just spray your facial mist onto clean skin morning and night before applying moisturizer and as needed during the day (typically, facial mists shouldn’t interfere with your makeup). That’s it!  ADD A SETTING SPRAY TO YOUR BEAUTY ROUTINE IF…  When you want to rock a “just applied” makeup look all day and night, a setting spray is the way to go! When your contour and your smoky eye are on point, we understand that you’ll try just about anything to maintain your look from desk to drinks. Instead of constantly reapplying or worrying about any makeup faux pas, make locking in your look with a setting spray as the last step in your makeup routine. A setting spray will increase your makeup’s lifespan—which means you can dance the night away without the fear of sweating your foundation off.  A setting spray can also come through in the clutch if you have oily skin. If you do have oily skin, chances are you’re layering on powder makeup to help your makeup stay put throughout the day. A setting spray can help soften the look of all the products you’ve previously applied—giving you the seamless look you’re after! Trust us, if you love powder makeup and layering your look, be sure to complete your beauty routine with a spritz of setting spray.  HOW TO USE A SETTING SPRAY  Once you’re done applying all of your makeup—foundation, concealer, eye shadow, mascara, lipstick, you name it—lightly mist your face with a setting spray to help lock everything in place. You can also use one midday to help refresh your makeup 	1

"Ed Sheeran revealed why Beyoncé has not been answering your emails: He says the ""Lemonade"" singer changes her email address every week.  On Friday, while at Jingle Ball in Inglewood, California, Sheeran told ET how he pulled off recording his new single, ""Perfect Duet,"" with Beyoncé.  ""I have an email address I email [to get in touch with Beyoncé],"" he said. Then he pointed out that Beyoncé's email address ""actually changes every week.""  Sheeran said he reached out to her via email and started working on the song in May, but it took a few months to finish the track, which finally dropped on Thursday.  ""Obviously she had twins [in June], and we finished [the song] in September, so I've been holding onto it since then,"" he said of the ""Perfect"" remix.  Speaking of ""Perfect,"" Sheeran added that Beyoncé only needed one take to record the song. Sheeran also said Beyoncé had some notes for him.  ""The original version of 'Perfect' was just an acoustic guitar,"" before more instruments were added, he explained. ""[Beyoncé] rung me up and was like, 'I don't know how you feel about this but I've taken all the instruments off it and it's just gonna be acoustic guitar,' and I was like, 'Ah that's great, because it used to be that!'""  ""Then when we got in together, it wasn't so much notes, it was very much like a back-and-forth thing, like, 'What'd you think of this?' Or, 'What do you think of this?' And [we were] probably in the studio for four hours.""  Once Beyoncé began recording, it was smooth sailing.  ""She was just like, 'Right!' Went in, one take, came out, like, 'Yeah, that sounds all right!'"" said Sheeran. See more of Sheeran's interview on ET."	1
"Margot Robbie was up for her first-ever Oscar at the 90th annual Academy Awards on Sunday, March 5, and while she didn’t take home the award for Best Actress, she stole the show in her custom couture Chanel gown and by participating in Jimmy Kimmel’s movie theater bit. But it’s her brother, Cameron Robbie, who is making headlines Monday morning.  The adorable Australian hilariously documented his Oscars viewing party and multiple champagne runs before trolling his older sister on Instagram after she lost Best Actress to Frances McDormand.  Margot walked the red carpet with their mother, Sarie Kessler, and that put Cameron into ""#excitementoverload” as he began documenting Hollywood’s biggest night. He then realized he had run out of champagne by the time Allison Janney was accepting her award for Best Supporting actress for I, Tonya, and made a run to the store.  “I have no champagne,"" he said. ""Margot, I love you, but I need to start drinking now,"" he added after he returned back “overheated.”"	1

When Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, emerged on the balcony of Buckingham Palace at the close of the Queen’s Diamond Jubilee celebrations, there was no mistaking her position and importance within the British royal family. Here was Prince William’s university sweetheart, a commoner from the Home Counties who had married the world’s most eligible prince in a fairy-tale wedding just a year earlier, taking her place alongside the line of succession and making history.  As the Queen of England stood flanked by the two men she refers to as “my substitutes”—her son the Prince of Wales and her grandson Prince William—she sent out a powerful message about the future of the newly streamlined British monarchy. There, alongside Camilla, the Duchess of Cornwall, and Prince Harry, was Kate. Resplendent in a champagne lace Alexander McQueen dress, a jaunty Jane Taylor hat, and her trademark L. K. Bennett nude stiletto heels, she looked entirely natural and at ease. The young woman, who just years earlier had been known as “Waity Katie,” was now at the forefront of the world’s most famous family.  Kate is the embodiment of a “People’s Princess” and—like William’s late mother, Diana, the Princess of Wales, and the forebear of that title—a world-renowned style icon. Over the past year, she has certainly proved to be the rising star of the monarchy, which is still riding high following the enormous success of the royal wedding—watched by a global audience of two billion—and the Queen’s recent Diamond Jubilee. Both events reprised a wave of affection the royal family feared it might never again experience.  Those close to William, who turned 30 on June 21, say that he has never been happier. While his birthright and sense of responsibility used to weigh heavily on his shoulders, William is now optimistic about his destiny, and ready to embrace it. “There’s a happiness in the House of Windsor generally at the moment for the first time ever,” says a family friend. “Charles and Camilla are genuinely happy. William is happy because Charles is troubled less, and he has Kate to share his future with.”  Like William, the Queen is said to be acutely aware that there must be no repeat of the past. The late Princess of Wales often complained that she felt like an outsider as she embarked on her new life as a working royal alongside the older and more seasoned Charles. Kate, in contrast, has been both better prepared and supported by her husband, whom she has described as a “great teacher.” She has taken to royal life like a duck to water. While she enjoys staying at the royal residences of Sandringham, in Norfolk, and Balmoral, in Scotland, she is said to find the constant clothes changes (up to five a day if the itinerary includes shooting, tea, and a formal dinner) and the omnipresence of a full household of staff rather stressful. The duchess is also still getting used to royal protocol, and a recent revision to the Order of Precedence, a document which outlines royal etiquette and protocol, was circulated to assist her. The “rules” were last revised when Camilla married Charles, and it is understood the Queen wanted them to be updated following Kate’s entry into “the Firm,” as the royal family refers to itself. According to protocol, if William is not present Kate is expected to curtsy to all senior members of the family, including blood princesses Beatrice and Eugenie, and she is always expected to curtsy to Camilla and the Prince of Wales. While the antiquated g	1
"The future isn't looking bright for Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban who recently attended a private counseling retreat in an attempt to save their marriage ""Nicole and Keith went for an emergency stay,"" an insider recently revealed to In Touch of the pair, who have been married for nearly 12 years. ""It was an extremely emotional and testing few days."" The couple's best efforts to repair their damaged relationship were unsuccessful, ""and now friends think this will end in divorce,"" the insider confessed. Simply put, there are just too many obstacles for the Oscar winner and the country superstar to overcome. During the course of their union, the two 50-year-old Australia natives have struggled to deal with Keith's addiction issues — he went to rehab four months after they wed in 2006 — as well as Nicole's anger over rumors of his infidelity. The couple, who share daughters Sunday, 9, and Faith, 7, ""have been fighting constantly over Nicole's incessant jealousy and need to control Keith on every level,"" added the insider. ""They have been putting a Band-Aid over their problems for too long. While they have smiles plastered on their faces in public, in private, things have been falling apart.""  The counseling trip to Vermont marked their final attempt to patch things up. ""It was Keith's idea to visit the boot camp,"" the insider said. The Lion actress resisted and only relented when Keith threatened to leave for good. ""He gave her an ultimatum,"" the source said. And she knew he wasn't bluffing. The insider said their recent fights have gotten so bad that Keith has even left their Nashville home to stay overnight at a hotel. ""It's become a second home for him. Of course, there have been times she's given up and walked out on him, too,"" the source revealed. But in Vermont, the pair were side by side as they hashed out their problems. ""They addressed a range of issues, including emotional intimacy, and focused on the root of their problems as they learned to break down walls and start working on their issues rather than plastering over the cracks,"" the insider explained. They both opened up. ""Keith said he couldn't continue to live in a marriage where he felt like he was being constantly monitored like one of her children,"" the source shared. ""And Nicole ended up breaking down and spilled her heart out about how past relationships had damaged her, and she vowed to make a conscious effort to change things."" The nearly weeklong retreat was intense. Said the insider, ""At one point it was touch-and-go whether they'd even leave together."" They ultimately did, and yet it didn't work — their problems still remain.  Nicole and Keith struggled from the outset of their union. When the ""Blue Ain't Your Color"" singer moved to Nashville from Australia in the '90s, drugs ""were my thing,"" he told Rolling Stone in 2016. ""I loved them."" By the time he met Nicole in 2005, he was seven years sober following a rehab stay in 1998. But he relapsed shortly after their 2006 wedding and checked into Betty Ford. Nicole was devastated. ""It was very, very hard to have to have her go through that,"" Keith later said. Nicole publicly stood by his side (and even hopped on a flight from Europe to be with him when she heard the news), but it was a struggle. ""It was just another twist in my life: Here it goes. Hold on, and off we go! But it was painful, deeply painful,"" she admitted to Vanity Fair in 2007. ""We were in a very, very, very bad, painful place, and have managed to step through it."" Other problems soon replaced that one. In 2015, Keith was photographed hanging out with his opening act, fellow country singer Kelsea Ballerini, 24, on his tour bus. The photos left Nicole furious. ""She calls him out every time he's pictured with another woman,"" according to a friend. ""Keith is constantly defending himself from rumors of on-tour affairs with groupies and female singers.""  Nicole — who attended this year's Oscars alone because Keith had a concert — has even admitted"	0

‘Why do so many of us, as female artists, have to go to war?’  ‘No to opening the door to him at all hours of the night.’  Opinion Harvey Weinstein Is My Monster Too  Harvey Weinstein was a passionate cinephile, a risk taker, a patron of talent in film, a loving father and a monster.  For years, he was my monster.  This fall, I was approached by reporters, through different sources, including my dear friend Ashley Judd, to speak about an episode in my life that, although painful, I thought I had made peace with.  I had brainwashed myself into thinking that it was over and that I had survived; I hid from the responsibility to speak out with the excuse that enough people were already involved in shining a light on my monster. I didn’t consider my voice important, nor did I think it would make a difference.  In reality, I was trying to save myself the challenge of explaining several things to my loved ones: Why, when I had casually mentioned that I had been bullied like many others by Harvey, I had excluded a couple of details. And why, for so many years, we have been cordial to a man who hurt me so deeply. I had been proud of my capacity for forgiveness, but the mere fact that I was ashamed to describe the details of what I had forgiven made me wonder if that chapter of my life had really been resolved.  When so many women came forward to describe what Harvey had done to them, I had to confront my cowardice and humbly accept that my story, as important as it was to me, was nothing but a drop in an ocean of sorrow and confusion. I felt that by now nobody would care about my pain — maybe this was an effect of the many times I was told, especially by Harvey, that I was nobody.  We are finally becoming conscious of a vice that has been socially accepted and has insulted and humiliated millions of girls like me, for in every woman there is a girl. I am inspired by those who had the courage to speak out, especially in a society that elected a president who has been accused of sexual harassment and assault by more than a dozen women and whom we have all heard make a statement about how a man in power can do anything he wants to women.  Well, not anymore.  In the 14 years that I stumbled from schoolgirl to Mexican soap star to an extra in a few American films to catching a couple of lucky breaks in “Desperado” and “Fools Rush In,” Harvey Weinstein had become the wizard of a new wave of cinema that took original content into the mainstream. At the same time, it was unimaginable for a Mexican actress to aspire to a place in Hollywood. And even though I had proven them wrong, I was still a nobody.  One of the forces that gave me the determination to pursue my career was the story of Frida Kahlo, who in the golden age of the Mexican muralists would do small intimate paintings that everybody looked down on. She had the courage to express herself while disregarding skepticism. My greatest ambition was to tell her story. It became my mission to portray the life of this extraordinary artist and to show my native Mexico in a way that combated stereotypes.  The Weinstein empire, which was then Miramax, had become synonymous with quality, sophistication and risk taking — a haven for artists who were complex and defiant. It was everything that Frida was to me and everything I aspired to be.  I had started a journey to produce the film with a different company, but I fought to get it back to take it to Harvey.  I knew him a little bit through my relationship with the director Robert Rodriguez and the producer Elizabeth Avellan, who was then his wife, with whom I had done several films and who had taken me under their wing. All I knew of Harvey at the time was that he had a remarkable intellect, he was a loyal friend and a family man.  Knowing what I know now, I wonder if it wasn’t my friendship with them — and Quentin Tarantino and George Clooney — that saved me from being raped.  The deal we made initially was that Harvey would pay for the rights o	0

by Maggie Bullock | Photographed by Gilles Bensimon | July 19, 2018  To the naked eye, it appears that remarkably little has changed about Elle Macpherson in the quarter-century since she was an 18-year-old Aussie surf junkie who started modeling to pay for law-school textbooks. Her legs are still infinite and impossibly lean, her hair still tosses like it’s in the gust of a perpetual wind machine, and her smile still radiates the just-try-to-keepup-with-me tomboy energy that made her the sex symbol of her generation. But Macpherson is in fact human, she swears, and around the time she turned 50 in 2014, she was experiencing symptoms that will sound familiar to even non supermodels.  “What I noticed is that my skin got dry,” she says. “I started to put on weight around my waist and hips, which was never my thing before. My legs started to get heavy. I started to feel lethargic. I also didn’t feel inspired. I wasn’t sleeping. My whole energy felt heavy.”  Nothing in particular had changed about her lifestyle, but everything that used to work— the diet and exercise that had kept her fit for decades—just wasn’t working anymore. On the recommendation of a friend who had recently enlisted London uber-nutritionist Simone Laubscher to help her weather a course of chemotherapy, Macpherson headed to Laubscher’s clinic in London’s Harley Street. She walked out with a suggestion to switch to a plant-based alkaline diet, and a jar of the doctor’s custom-mixed powdered greens supplement. Within two weeks, her skin changed. “What I’d always thought were sunspots—actually, they were sugar spots— started to clear, and my skin looked tighter, dewier and plumper. I started to lose weight, probably because my sugar cravings had subsided. My digestion improved. I felt more emotionally balanced.” The change was so dramatic, “it was like a light bulb went off,” she says. “I realized, this isn’t a fixed state of being. I can change the way I feel.”  Long before the term multi-hyphenate had become the standard famous-person job description cliché, Macpherson was seizing opportunities to become not just Elle, The Body, but Elle, The Business. As early as the mid-80s, it occurred to her that if Sports Illustrated could make good money selling calendars fronted by her own tawny, sun-dappled image, so could she. Macpherson hired a crew, set up her own shoots and sold them to a publisher. Then, recognizing that regular folks might enjoy watching a famous model make her own calendar, looped in a local TV station to document the project. Voilà, free PR. “It was the kind of thing where I spent $60,000 and made a million,” Macpherson says, then demurs, “well, not those numbers exactly,” but you get the idea. “It was one of those experiences where I realized that if I take initiative, apply what I’ve learned and take a risk, then it may pay off.” By the time Macpherson had her green-diet epiphany, she was already a practiced businesswoman: Elle Macpherson Body,a global lingerie empire of high-end lacy underthings— among them, incidentally, really good bras for women of most sizes—is sold everywhere from Net-a-Porter to Saks. True to form, her a-ha moment electrified not just a new lifestyle, but a new business plan. Enlisting Laubscher as a formulator for the brand, she souped up the nutritionist’s miracle powder and launched the Super Elixir Greens, a blend of 45 plant-based ingredients that dissolve in water for an all-in-one daily health boost. Other beauty-from-within products followed, including the Nourishing Plant Protein powder (she blends the chocolate flavor with avocado and eats it with a spoon). The mother of two called us from home in Miami to talk about life as a wellness guru.  YOU’VE BECOME SUCH A VOCAL PROPONENT OF ALKALINITY. WHAT DO YOU DO BESIDES TAKING THE ELIXIR TO MAINTAIN YOUR PH LEVELS?  If I’m really in my groove, I love a raw, plant-based diet. That’s how I feel best. I eat grains, nuts, seeds, beans, vegetables, almond milk, hemp mi	1
A cursory glance at the Spring ’16 collections reveals that fashion is in the midst of a major shift. The minimalism that ruled the runways (and our wardrobes) for the better part of five years has been replaced by a cobbled-together, anything-goes sensibility; now more than ever, women are being encouraged to mix, match, and wear only what they love. To many of us, Gucci’s glittering knits and Vetements’s tablecloth boots are an invitation to get creative—but to the uninitiated, it could all simply read as tacky. The concept of “good” vs. “bad” taste has been of recent debate here in the Vogue offices—how do you determine what’s chic and what isn’t? Or is some degree of tackiness the secret to inspired style?  The continued ’90s revival indicates the answer is yes—and that counts for denim, too. Super-wide ’70s flares and faded Levi’s 501s are great, but those looking to make a quieter, less literal statement may want to consider the oft-forgotten boot-cut jean. More curve-hugging than a flare but longer and leaner than a straight-leg, it nails the tricky middle ground between familiar and au courant. “The boot-cut is back!” says Kelly Connor, Vogue.com’s resident denim expert. “They’re flattering, lengthening, and perfect for those who aren’t so into the full, high-rise flares we’ve been seeing everywhere.”    Jane Birkin Photo: Getty Images  While images of denim icons like Françoise Hardy and Jane Birkin instantly spring to mind, Connor’s personal boot-cut muses might surprise you. “I love the boot-cut jeans of the early ’00s—Britney Spears, Halle Berry, and all those glossy blondes from The Hills and Laguna Beach,” she says. “In retrospect, Kristin Cavallari was quite chic and ahead of her time!”  Perhaps boot-cut jeans are refreshing because they are considered a tad tacky. Or maybe it’s because we haven’t worn them in a while; chances are you’ve got a pair tucked away in the back of your closet. Either way, there’s no denying the thigh-slimming, rear-lifting powers of a fitted, dark-rinse, mid- or high-rise jean that kicks out just below the knee. The sharp, sleek silhouette will quickly upgrade the chunky sweaters, lace blouses, and anything else you’re buying this fall—not to mention the obvious choice: a great pair of boots.	1

UFC fighter Ronda Rousey put her best face forward on her wedding day. The athlete called in her beloved glam squad to Hawaii to help her primp ahead of her intimate backyard wedding to MMA fighter Travis Browne. Her goal, while using longtime makeup artist Hee Soo, was to put forth a fresh, barely-there makeup look.  “She really didn’t have a lot on,” Soo told E! News this week. “She is an athlete. They tend to have really beautiful skin because they sweat and work out so much. Your natural sweat cleans out your pores.”  Along with her no-frills wedding, Rousey wanted a similar vibe for her hair and makeup. The bride, who looked resplendent in a Galia Lahav couture gown, opted for a simple textured bun crafted by her longtime hairstylist Abraham Esparza before sitting down with Soo.  “The ‘no-makeup makeup look’ was easy because she had a little tan,” she continued. Below, see the steps that the makeup artist took to achieve Rousey’s fresh face.      Prep the Skin  Soo started by using an exfoliator by Fresh on Rousey’s clean face. She then applied every beauty buff’s favorite Crème de la Mer by La Mer, followed by an eye cream by Clé de Peau.  La Mer Crème de la Mer, 1 oz, $170, Sephora.com  Apply Foundation  Continuing on with the Clé de Peau products, Soo then applied a foundation by the luxury beauty company that melted into Rousey’s tan skin tone.  Enhance the Eyes  Soo went light around Rousey’s eyes to enhance the bride’s gray pigmentation. The artist used an orange eyeshadow by Stila to draw out Rousey’s feature followed by a smudge of sheer nude in the corners.      Use Waterproof Mascara  Soo has been on Rousey’s team for years, so it only made sense that she knew the day would be filled with tears and a plethora of emotions. Hence, why the pro went for a waterproof mascara that would stay put. “I knew her and Travis were going to be kissing a lot, so we wanted something that would not get everywhere and come off on him—that and the crying,” she told E! “Her makeup looks so good because I do a lot of prep on her face beforehand.”  Pop the Pout  The makeup pro decided to go for color on Rousey’s lips, using a By Terry lip balm in the Berry color. “[It] makes you look like you just bit into a bunch of cherries,” Soo said.      Overall, the barely-there makeup stayed put despite the heightened emotions. “There was lots of crying and happiness,” Soo concluded. “The makeup lasted all day.”  Rousey, meanwhile, took to Instagram to thank her glam squad for perfecting her wedding day look. ”Thank you @thisisbabe @heeezooo @alejandroperazastyle for flying to the middle of the the Pacific Ocean to help me get ready,” she said before adding an adorable shout-out to her husband. “And thank you @travisbrownemma for choosing me every day forever #wrongmovesucka#YouGoinNowhere.”  Related Articles	1
"Demi Lovato has been dating her boyfriend Wilmer Valderrama for a long time, and they are probably one of the most adorable couples in Hollywood. So obviously, Lovatics freaked out when the ""Really Don't Care"" singer announced her engagement on Instagram. However, Dilmer isn't making it official! Instead, she just got ""engaged"" to an adorable young fan, Grant.  The five year old held up a sign in the audience reading ""Demi I have a ring for you,"" and then he kneeled down and popped the question after she invited him onstage. (She had to teach him how to propose, which was even more adorable.)  Later, Demi posted a picture on Instagram announcing her ""engagement,"" calling it one of the cutest things ever.

Oprah Winfrey couldn’t help but gush over Jimmy Kimmel’s little brother potential in a hilarious new interview, and her reasoning is totally valid.  During yesterday’s episode of Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Winfrey revealed that she would gladly welcome the late-night host into her tight-knit family. She said, “I said to your producer, I wish you were my little brother, ’cause I think you’re like America’s little brother.”  The media mogul went on to imagine herself as a proud big sister, saying, “And every time you’re on and you say something profound or funny or you do one of these great skits with kids, I go, ‘Oh, that’s Jimmy.’ I just love to say, ‘That’s my little brother. He was always like that.’”  Kimmel’s response? “I accept your sisterhood.”  Should this sorority-cum-family start accepting applications, we’ll be the first to apply.

"Check it out for yourself, below:  As you'd expect, people on Twitter have been rejoicing over this news. But whether or not this story is true, it does hilariously highlight how weird it is to be a celebrity. I mean, we live in a world where they sell their used tissues on eBay for $5,000. And straight-up stop government elections because of their concerts. Hell, they put leeches on their bodies — for health reasons! So it's not that surprising that your favorite stars occasionally travel in unconventional ways, like private planes, tour buses, and...getting stuffed into suitcases.  Is traveling in a suitcase strange? Sure. Unabashedly extra? Absolutely. The opening scene of a future T. Swift music video called ""My Love Is in a Suitcase?"" Probably. But it's actually not that far-fetched: After all, Adele was frequently wheeled to the stage in an equipment box on her last tour. Lady Gaga arrived to the 2011 Grammy Awards in a giant egg. Sometimes the outside world is just too hard, and the only way to escape is by hopping into a box.  Of course, it's also possible this is complete rubbish or a misprint. The caption that started the mania in the first place spells Swift's name wrong in one place — so how reliable is it, actually? (And honestly, does it really matter? We wrote about it, so the joke's on us.)  Regardless, I hope somewhere right now Swift is curled up in her carry-on and cackling.  UPDATE: According to Spin, Splash News (the photo outlet responsible for this hoopla) is retracting its report that Taylor Swift was carried out of her New York City apartment in a suitcase. “I literally just put the phone down from someone on Taylor’s camp,” a Splash representative told Spin. “We’re having to actually retract that.” The representative says the photographer who originally made the claim didn't verify it. ""The report stated it as a fact, which we actually don’t know,” the representative said. “How could we?” Womp.  RELATED: Taylor Swift Made a Super-Brief Cameo in an Episode of 13 Reasons Why"	0

Tammin Sursok is opening up to fans about a recent painful loss she is going through.  The Pretty Little Liars actress took to Instagram on Friday (December 15) to share her emotional and cryptic message.  PHOTOS: Check out the latest pics of Tammin Sursok  “It’s been hard for me to be on social media this week,” she captioned the photo below. “We have been going through something as a family and it’s hard to mask what we are feeling.”  “I always want to be authentic with you,” she continued. “Last week was the first time I’ve experienced loss. That’s as much as I’m going to say right now but I do want to write about what we have been through at some point to help anyone who is also going through it.”  “The holiday season is beautiful but sometimes you hurt and it’s messy and confusing and irritating,” she added. “You become angry and you don’t know at who to be angry. You realize that your anger just stems from pain. So if you are hurting this holiday season, for any reason, know I’m with you and I see you. And the only way out is through. Together we got this.”  We’re sending Tammin all of our positive thoughts this season and always.	1
Prince William appeared to hint that the due date of his third child might be earlier than expected as he chatted with a trainee midwife during a charity visit.  The Duke of Cambridge jokingly told student Grace Gunn, 19, that she might see him 'sooner' than she thought when the pair met yesterday at the east London-based Spitalfields Crypt Trust.  As he said his goodbyes, William, 35, said to the teenager: 'All the best with the midwifery - might see you sooner than you think.'  It came after the royal let slip last week that he had been 'a bit anxious to start with but [we can] start celebrating this week,' suggesting the Duchess of Cambridge might be further along in her pregnancy than previously speculated.  Slip of the tongue? Prince William jokingly told a trainee midwife that she might see him 'sooner' than she thought as he visited an east London charity yesterday, pictured  Kate, 35, is planning to make her first public appearance since announcing her pregnancy more than two weeks ago. Pictured, during her last official appearance on August 30  Meanwhile Kate, 35, who was last seen in public on August 30, appears to be preparing to return to royal duties after taking time off due to severe morning sickness.  Kensington Palace today named the duchess as one of the co-hosts of a Buckingham Palace reception due to be held next month.  Alongside Princes William and Harry, she is set to welcome guests to an event celebrating the contribution of those working in the mental health sector.  The development suggests the duchess is starting to see an improvement in her health after she was struck down with Hyperemesis Gravidarum (HG), a complication that causes excessive nausea and vomiting which Kate suffered during her first two pregnancies.  The illness meant Kate and William were forced to make an early pregnancy announcement a fortnight ago.  As William said his goodbyes at the Spitalfields Crypt Trust yesterday, pictured, he told a trainee midwife: 'All the best with the midwifery - might see you sooner than you think'  Since then the Duchess has been forced to miss a number of planned engagements, including her son's Prince George's first day of school, because of the condition.  However, her husband, Prince William, told well-wishers that she was 'doing well' during a visit to Liverpool earlier this month.  Last week he also appeared to let slip at the time that Kate was 11 weeks pregnant. This would mean the baby could be due as early as March next year.  While supporters are eagerly awaiting the duchess' return to public life, they were treated to new images of the royal when she appeared in a charity video about children's mental health that was released earlier this week.  Growing family: The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, pictured with George and Charlotte during their European tour, are preparing to welcome their third child together next year  On Monday Kate launched the 'You're never too young to talk mental health' campaign by the Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families.  In a video recorded in January, several months before she is believed to have fallen pregnant, Kate urged parents to encourage their children to be 'open about their feelings'.  Donning a £1,600 Eponine blue coat, the well-spoken duchess also called on people to speak out when they have feelings that are 'too big to manage on our own'.  The campaign, which aims to promote mental health awareness in schools, includes a video introduction from Kate, which she recorded on a visit to the Child Bereavement UK Centre in East London in January this year.	1

Brittany Cartwright and Jax Taylor’s big day is coming together.  The Vanderpump Rules lovebirds have landed on a date and location for their wedding, planning to tie the knot next summer at the Kentucky Castle, a boutique hotel located in Versailles, Kentucky, designed to look like a European palace. It’s where Brittany, a Kentucky native, says she’s always wanted to get married.  “It’s actually, knock on wood, it’s running smoother than expected,” Jax shares of wedding planning. It’s also, seemingly, been easier than expected. Brittany confesses to finding her dream wedding dress on the first day she went out shopping!  “I did not mean to, but the very first place I went to I actually found a dress,” she recalls. “I'm not gonna just announce the designer and stuff just yet because I don't want [Jax] to know anything about it. Whenever I walk down the aisle, that's gonna be the first time he sees it or knows anything about what it looks like.”  The 29-year-old says fans will get to see part of her wedding dress experience on season seven of VPR, but she made sure cameras were off when she said yes to the dress. The pair has also put asks out to their bridal party -- expect lots of Vanderpump co-stars flanking the couple at the altar -- and is finalizing their guest list.  “I think our cap is gonna be around 200, 220 [guests], something like that,” Brittany shares.  “It’s a destination wedding, so we’re gonna have some people who won’t be able to make it,” Jax adds. “I mean, we’ve got some people that have never been to Kentucky before that are coming.”  One person they know for sure won’t snag an invite is James Kennedy, who burnt any bridge he had with the couple after “freestyling” a rap about Jax cheating on Brittany.  ”They made it look like it was just a one-time thing, where he said a line in a 'freestyle,’” Brittany recalls. “It was a much bigger deal, and we all know it’s not a freestyle. James does not freestyle. I’m sure he can’t actually freestyle.”  All that’s left to do for the couple is nail down their menu, cake and an officiant. While co-stars Katie Maloney and Tom Schwartz asked Lisa Vanderpump to conduct their 2016 wedding ceremony, Jax and Brittany plan to let Lisa just sit back and enjoy their day.  “We love Lisa, so it’s not like we would be like, ‘No, wouldn’t want that!’” Brittany explains. “It’s very important to my family that we have somebody from the church.”  “It’s important to me, too,” Jax chimes in. “I thought what [Tom and Katie] did with Lisa was really cool and very awesome, for them … I thought what they did was really amazing. I think it just worked. You know, Brittany is a Christian girl, and I literally just started going to church again this year.”  “I’m gonna ask somebody that I went to church with when I was a little girl,” Brittany says of picking their officiant. “He’s known me my whole life, and he’s a great speaker. Just so down to earth, so cool.”  For more Jax and Brittany, tune into Vanderpump Rules every Monday at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.

"It's official. We can add Joe Manganiello, erstwhile star of True Blood and Magic Mike, to the ranks of hot nerds.  For reference, this is the Joe Manganiello that we know and love:  Oh, and this one:  This one, too. Always this one:  But, according to wife Sofia Vergara, this is also Joe Manganiello:  On the red carpet for the 2017 Emmy Awards, the Modern Family star—who also brought her hot son as a date—was asked by Guiliana Rancic to reveal a secret about Joe that audiences don't know. Sofia's response:  ""He's a nerd.""  ""The highlight of his life is to play Dungeons and Dragons,"" she said with a laugh. ""He talks together with like eight friends... He has a dungeon room downstairs.""  Now, if I told you that Joe Manganiello and Sofia Vergara had a dungeon room in the basement of their house, what would you expect? Something like this probably:  Well, you'd be wrong. Sofia reports that she's decorated Joe's gameplay room and that gameplay is definitely not a euphemism.  Giuliana asked if Sofia had learned how to join the game. That's also a no.  ""I organize the figurines and put the cheese out,"" she said.  Honestly, I would think that all of this was double entendres if Joe hadn't talked publicly about his love of D&D (not a euphemism) before in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter.  The Emmys are just beginning and already the event is causing us to question everything we knew to be true.  Just for reference, this guy's wife thinks he's a nerd:"	1

Katie Holmes wants nothing more than for daughter Suri to have a relationship with her dad, Tom Cruise, but the actor is reportedly making that difficult. All of Katie’s calls to her ex-husband are allegedly being ignored, according to a new report!  This situation sounds so painful! Tom Cruise, 55, reportedly hasn’t seen his 11-year-old daughter, Suri Cruise, in 1458 days. Suri’s mom, Katie Holmes, 38, wants to remedy the situation and reunite him with their daughter, once and for all. That’s why she’s reportedly called him over and over, according to a report from InTouch Weekly! The problem is, Katie’s apparently hitting a wall when it comes to contacting her ex-husband. Tom’s reportedly ignoring her desperate pleas.  “[Katie] has reached out [to Tom] in the hopes of opening a dialogue about resuming contact with Suri,” a source told InTouch Weekly. “She truly wants Tom to be a part of Suri’s life. It has been radio silence from Tom and his family. She’s been shut out. Nobody knows why he hasn’t spoken to her about Suri. It’s frustrating. Katie doesn’t want her divorce from Tom and the issues they had to impact Suri. That isn’t fair. Katie would like to at least have a conversation with Tom. Tom is Suri’s father and she wants them to have a relationship.”  This is so heartbreaking. Suri must miss her dad a lot after such a long time apart. If Tom and his team continue to ignore Katie’s calls, she’s got a definite backup plan. She thinks that her boyfriend, Jamie Foxx, 49, is a positive male role model for Suri! Katie loves how devoted Jamie is to his two daughters, a source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY, and she’s so grateful that he spends time and attention on Suri!  HollywoodLife.com has reached out to Katie and Tom’s reps for comment.  HollywoodLifers, do you think Tom will reunite with his daughter soon? Let us know!	0

(Spoilers ahead for “The Walking Dead” on AMC)  Maggie (Lauren Cohan) is gone, but she’s not dead. The fifth episode of season 9 of “The Walking Dead” revealed that she left the Hilltop with the mysterious Georgie during the big time jump that came at the end of Rick Grimes’ final episode.  And it turns out that may have also been Maggie’s final episode ever. Clearly, the creatives on the show and the folks at AMC are hedging their bets by not killing her off. But it’s entirely possible she’ll never appear on “The Walking Dead” ever again.  We had heard rumblings of Cohan’s exit from the series all year, following stories of a contentious contract dispute in which Cohan wanted equal pay with other longtime series regulars Andrew Lincoln and Norman Reedus. After signing on to ABC’s “Whiskey Cavalier,” which will debut mid-season, Cohan did say she would be able to come back to “The Walking Dead” for at least part of Season 9.  Also Read: 'Walking Dead': Everything We Know, and Think We Know, About Georgie  But that part of the season is now over, as “TWD” showrunner Angela Kang has confirmed that they don’t have plans for her to appear again in Season 9. And on the episode of “Talking Dead” after the season 9 mid-season finale, Chris Hardwicke read a statement from the producers which re-confirmed that Cohan won’t be back this season but that “Maggie’s story is not done” and that they “hope to have her back” at some point in the future.  Lauren Cohan addressed the situation again recently in similarly ambiguous terms, saying that “there may have been some conversations” about her return to “The Walking Dead” but that we’ll have have to wait and “see what happens.”  That all probably felt like it was coming totally out of left field, considering how Maggie did not get any kind of real sendoff. Her final (as far as we know) episode also being Rick’s last didn’t help, since the episode basically functioned as Rick’s death episode.  But what AMC is doing with Rick may also be the path for wrapping up Maggie’s story. Two weeks ago, at the end of their final episode, Rick ended up being airlifted by helicopter away from Virginia, and what happens to him wherever he ends up will be the subject of a series of movies.  Also Read: Here's What You Need to Know About That Talking Zombie on 'The Walking Dead'  Meanwhile, it’s long been theorized that the helicopter belongs to the same group that Georgie hails from — the Commonwealth, an actual large city of people in Ohio. If that theory pans out, and Georgie’s people are also the helicopter’s people, then there’s plenty of reason for Rick and Maggie to cross paths in this new corner of the “Walking Dead” universe.  But everything remains shrouded in mystery, and it sounds like nobody involved actually knows at this time what Maggie’s fate will end up being. If Georgie actually is with the Commonwealth, then the subject of Maggie is going to have to come up again sooner or later — the Commonwealth is the next big storyline in the comics after the Whisperer War that is about to begin on the show.  Also Read: Apocalypse Not Yet? First 'Walking Dead' Without Andrew Lincoln Sees Steady Ratings  So, at least, you probably shouldn’t expect a Heath (Corey Hawkins) situation — remember how he went out scavenging with Tara and then just never came back, his fate still undetermined? Maggie is so important that her fate will have to be dealt with at some point in the next couple seasons of “The Walking Dead,” even if Lauren Cohan never comes back.  Just don’t expect closure any time soon.	1
    Home for the spring holidays! The night before Easter, admirably friendly exes Mariah Carey and Nick Cannon reunited to celebrate with their 5-year-old twins, Monroe and Moroccan. The “Emotions” singer took to Instagram to post a sweet snap of the family decorating Easter eggs . In the adorable photo, the family of four sits around a kitchen table dying eggs in all sorts of pastel colors for Easter. “Easter with #demkids,” she shared with her followers. “#moments #rocandroe #easter #family @nickcannon.”  Looks like the pop-megastar is trying to change the nickname of her growing twins to #demkids, who have been referred to by fans as #dembabies since their birth in 2012. The duo were married in April of 2008 but the “Honey” singer filed for divorce December of 2014.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BS-SZfWl8gS/  Carey and Cannon’s Easter celebration just a week after the “Glitter” actress announced she had split from backup dancer, Bryan Tanka after a year of dating. According to TMZ, Tanaka felt “disrespected” when Carey and Cannon, 36, attended the Nickelodeon Kids’ Choice Awards with their children on March 11. Tanaka would reportedly “lash back” at Carey and her friendship with Cannon by flirting with other women. Per TMZ, the pair have not seen or spoken to each other since they traveled to Cabo together at the end of March.  https://www.instagram.com/p/BS-SjBrF1Et/  The “Butterfly” singer also suffered heartbreak in October of 2016 after confirming her breakup with Australian billionaire, James Packer. The former couple had been together ever since being introduced to each other by their mutual friend, producer Brett Ratner, at the premiere of 2014’s Hercules.  Cannon has also had some big life changes this year after becoming a father for the third time over announcing the birth of his son Golden “Sagon” Cannon on his Instagram Page on Tuesday, Feb. 21. The Wild ’N’ Out star captioned the photo. “Weeping may endure for a night, but Joy cometh in the morning! No matter how hard the world may hit you, God always reminds us of our purpose! #TrueHappiness, welcome to Earth Son!” added Cannon, 36.	1
We keep wondering – how did Emma Watson manage to keep a straight face? The Internet went crazy after behind-the-scenes footage of Watson and Dan Stevens’ scenes from the movie Beauty and the Beast got leaked.  These scenes quickly became memes as we expected and they show Belle in her iconic yellow ball dress being escorted to her romantic night in the castle by a very strange-looking beast.  By strange we mean that Stevens was decked out in a bulbous motion-capture Lycra suit along with stilt-type contraptions in his feet!  Dressed like that, he was solemn while attempting to walk down the castle stairs. It’s just hilarious!  How about we call the movie Beauty and the Puffy Guy, instead?  This doesn’t look like any other fairy tale anyone’s ever seen before, trust us!  In a behind-the-scene interview, filmmakers explained that for making Stevens image as beastly as possible, his suit was decked out with stilts and also with some extra padding which to us looks more like a crash-test dummy than an adorable yet feared Beastly creature.  Best thing ever! I now want to watch the whole movie with @thatdanstevens just in the ugly suit. Love this movie more and more daily. pic.twitter.com/oXKQgZ077b — Harlee (@albionscastle) May 24, 2017  Stevens explained, “Puppeteering the suit to the motion capture was an ordeal for my calf muscles alone, let alone the whole body, just to kind of manipulate it.”  The movie’s director, Bill Condon, praised him for his amazing performance and hard work. He said that “I really stood in awe of Dan.”  “Not only did he conquer the technology, but he had fun with it. I always said, we could get everything else in this movie right, but if we didn’t get a beast that people believed in, then it wouldn’t work,” Condon continued.  And it’s pretty obvious that it worked. The adaptation of the animated Disney classic topped the $900 million mark at the worldwide box office in its very first month.  In April, it surpasses the $1 billion box office mark and this is quite an amazing thing.  Advertisement  Disney’s animated classic takes on a new fresh form with a widened mythology in the movie. A young price in the form of a beast which can be freed only by true love meets Belle who is the only human girl to ever visit his castle since it was enchanted. And from here, you’ll just have to chek the story out for yourselves!	1
"During the band’s Tuesday appearance on CBS’ 'The Late Late Show,' Corden made an amusing attempt to become the band’s new member.  The Backstreet Boys might have found a new member in James Corden — or so he hopes — as the late-night host performed alongside the boy band for a revamped version of their hit single during Tuesday night’s Late Late Show.  Jokingly promoting their new boy band, dubbed “James Street,” group members Nick Carter, Howie Dorough, AJ McLean, Kevin Richardson and Brian Littrell performed an mock version of their 1999 single, “Larger Than Life,” changing it to “Late Late-r Than Life” to reflect Corden’s 12:37 p.m. broadcast.  Prior to their sketch, the band teased their appearance with their mock album cover with Corden on Twitter, where they created the hashtag ""#Jamesstreet.""  In the performance, the late-night host and singers donned their signature white attire, recognizable from their 1999 album, Millennium, which featured the “Larger Than Life” single.  The sketch opened with Corden explaining that he plans to take over for one of the Backstreet Boys at their performance later that night. ""Corden's back, alright,"" he sang to the bandmembers as he stated his plan.  While Kevin Richardson explained to Corden that no one was going to opt out of the performance, the late-night host responded, ""How hard is it? What is being a Backstreet Boy? It's wearing a fedora and dancing on some tarmac. I think I got it.""  Following Brian Littrell's insistence that Corden could not handle the costume changes, Corden let the members vote on whom he replaces. Corden then decided that he should take Littrell's place onstage. ""Show me the meaning of being lonely,"" Corden said, referencing another song off the album, as Littrell exited the dressing room.  Following Littrell's forced departure, Corden tried to learn the choreography for the performance. He also took the liberty of suggesting new dance moves. When asked when he should do the worm, Howie Dorough responded, ""Maybe after the show.""  Despite resistance from the bandmembers, Corden eventually took on the role of choreographer and incorporated a number of new dance moves, including the band lifting him up during ""Larger Than Life."" When they perfected the lift, Corden instructed, ""And then you guys disappear 'til the end of the song.""  Not only did Corden take over for the performance, but he also attended the band's meet and greet. When taking a group photo with a fan, Corden flipped the iPhone camera and instead took a selfie. He then blocked a fan in another photo.  Corden led a prayer circle before he and the Backstreet Boys took the stage. ""Dear Lord, heavenly Jesus. I know what you're thinking. What's Brian doing there? We're thinking the same,"" he said. ""Make us strong. Show us the meaning of being lonely. Quit playing games with out hearts. Give us the call and know that everybody."" After a moment of silence, he added, ""I can't think of any other Backstreet Boys songs. We want it that way. We want it that way!""  The sketch then cut to the performance, in which a photo of Littrell onstage was been replaced with one of Corden. The band then appeared and began to sing ""Larger Than Life"" while the musicians are suspended on platforms in the air. Littrell eventually joined the group onstage. Corden then ran to the front of the stage and showed off his best dance moves, including the running man and the worm, as the band sang behind him.  The performance concluded when Corden thanked fans for coming and told them to drive home safe. Richardson then explained that they had 22 more songs to perform. ""I quit the band,"" Corden responded before walking offstage.  Amid the release of their new single “Don’t Go Breaking My Heart,” the band is also headlining a Las Vegas residency, Backstreet Boys: Larger Than Life. This year, the group celebrated its 25th anniversary."	1
"© Matt Baron/REX/Shutterstock Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt attend their ""By the Sea"" film premiere in Los Angeles on Nov. 5, 2015.  It's been nearly two years since Angelina Jolie left Brad Pitt and took their six kids with her in September 2016. But even after all this time, they have yet to finalize a divorce and custody agreement.  That's apparently now causing problems for the star, who allegedly wants to take their children -- Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 9 -- with her to London where she'll film Disney's ""Maleficent 2"" this summer. Brad is based in Los Angeles, where Angelina also bought a home in 2017.  In a May 23 report, Page Six writes that Hollywood sources familiar with her film have revealed Angelina, 42, ""is furious since she wants to bring the couple's brood with her while the film shoots."" The implication is that her current custody arrangement with Brad -- the terms of which have remained confidential -- doesn't allow her to do that at will.  ""They are figuring out how it would work, but she is not happy,"" a source told Page Six. ""She wants to take the kids to London with her while she's shooting -- and she's frustrated with the process. They're talking about how it would work.""  Angelina is so livid about the whole situation, the source added, ""Even the people around her are getting tired of it.""  © Matt Baron/REX/Shutterstock Angelina Jolie attends the Critics' Choice Awards in Los Angeles on Jan. 11, 2018.  The report came hours after Us Weekly published a story claiming that Brad, 54, planned his summer work schedule in such a way that he could ensure he'd have time to spend with his six kids.  ""He chose a project that films in Los Angeles,"" an insider said in the new issue of Us Weekly. (Brad is starring alongside Leonardo DiCaprio in Quentin Tarantino's upcoming ""Once Upon a Time in Hollywood."") Brad made sure he has a flexible schedule that will help in his divorce settlement with Angelina, the insider explains, adding, ""Brad wants certain provisions in a custody agreement that guarantee custodial time with all six kids.""  © John Salangsang/Variety/REX/Shutterstock Brad Pitt attends the Cadillac Oscar Celebration in Los Angeles on March 1, 2018.  Another source told Us that Angelina ""has been very hesitant to agree to Brad's terms because she does resent him for essentially forcing her to settle down in Los Angeles with the kids"" after years of traveling the globe with them.

She is currently a host on the Telemundo morning show Un Nuevo Día.  Early career [ edit ]  The daughter of an undertaker, Luis López, Adamari started her career at the age of six in the Telemundo Canal 2 production of the Cristina Bazán soap opera, alongside legendary Puerto Rican actress Johanna Rosaly and Venezuelan singer José Luis Rodríguez, El Puma.  Her talent indicated a future superstar. WAPA-TV next chose her to play Iris Chacón and Daniel Guerrero's daughter in Yo sé que mentía. She was a child actress playing an important supporting role in the story, thus became a household name.[2]  A short, two chapter appearance on Vivir Para Ti followed in 1983, and after that, López decided to dedicate herself to her studies. She holds a B.A. in Communications from the University of the Sacred Heart  Adulthood and fame [ edit ]  After reaching the age of maturity, she came back, participating in several plays at Puerto Rico's Teatro Tapia, San Juan's premier and oldest theater, and getting the attention of Mexican producers.  She traveled to Mexico next, after the invitation by the producers to try out there, and became a superstar in that country as well, working in many top soap operas, including Camila and the national super hit Amigas y Rivales. López also participated in Mujer, Casos de la Vida Real, where she played a victim of rape that later turned lesbian.  Recent years [ edit ]  In 2004, López participated in the soap opera Mujer de Madera. During the recording of that soap opera, her father, Luis, a respected and successful undertaker, suffered a heart attack and had to be hospitalized and operated on. López was given immediate permission to travel to Puerto Rico and be with her father for as long as she needed. Her father recovered, but with only five percent of his heart working. López had to return to Mexico after her father was released from the hospital, but she flew back to Puerto Rico every time that the filming schedule allowed her to. In 2011, she participated in the second season of Univision's dancing show Mira Quien Baila where she was one of the top dancers and won the competition.  Personal life and relationships [ edit ]  López was the wife of fellow Puerto Rican singing super star Luis Fonsi. In 2006, López and Fonsi announced they would be getting married during the summer of that year. They were married on June 3, 2006 in Puerto Rico. On November 8, 2009, Adamari López and Luis Fonsi released a joint statement where they announced they were separating. They were divorced on November 8, 2010.

In 2019 she and Toni celebrated 8 years together, as a couple.[6]  Health [ edit ]  On March 22, 2005, López held a press conference in San Juan announcing she had been diagnosed with breast cancer. Her then-boyfriend, Luis Fonsi, announced at the same press conference that he was cancelling his 2005 international tour to be by her side. She was expected to recover, as her cancer was caught at ""stage 1,"" which is a very early stage, and it had not spread to other areas of her body.  She underwent cancer surgery. In 2006, it was reported that she is in remission. Since being diagnosed, she has campaigned for breast cancer awareness.[7]  Filmography [ edit ]  Telenovelas [ edit ]  See also [ edit ]"	1

    Nothin’ but love here. Exes Kate Bosworth and Alexander Skarsgard reunited at an afterparty for the 2018 Met Gala on Monday, May 7, where they not only exchanged pleasantries, but also posed for photos together!  The former flames, who dated for two years before breaking up in 2011, attended Versace’s 2018 Met Gala Afterparty at the Mark Hotel following the event, which was held at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Bosworth, 35, and the Big Little Lies star, 41, were in good company, as Donatella Versace, Justin Theroux, Jared Leto, Black Panther’s Chadwick Boseman and other stars were also in attendance.  The friendly reunion was a far cry from when the former Straw Dogs costars went to great lengths to avoid each other at the movie’s screening in September 2011, by scheduling their arrivals an hour apart following the announcement of their split in July of that year. Still, a source told Us the breakup was “very mutual” and the actor even sang Bosworth’s praises in an interview while promoting the film. “Kate is such a great actress and she’s so much more than a good-looking Hollywood starlet,” he told BlackBook at the time. “We shared a really special experience on that film.”  The Win a Date With Ted Hamilton actress shared the same sentiment, telling the outlet, “He’s got this rare, wonderful control and stillness that you notice in a lot of old movie stars. I feel incredibly lucky to have had that type of man on this movie.”  The Before I Wake star has since moved on from the Swedish actor. In 2013, she married film director Michael Polish, who she met on the set of 2011’s Big Sur, in an intimate ceremony in Montana. As for the True Blood alum, he was previously linked to Alexa Chung in 2015.	1

"A post-mortem examination will take place on Friday on the body of Prince, after the pioneering musician died at his home aged 57 amid reports he was treated for a drug overdose just days before his death.  Tributes continued to pour in from around the world for the pop superstar, who died after being found collapsed in a lift at his home in Minnesota. A cause of death was not immediately determined and police are investigating.  The singer - real name Prince Rogers Nelson - was confirmed dead at Paisley Park in Minnesota, days after being rushed to hospital after falling ill on tour. His body was found unresponsive at the estate where he lived and worked in a recording studio.  TMZ, the American celebrity gossip site, claimed that the star had been treated for a drug overdose days before his death.  They said his plane made an emergency landing in Illinois on Friday so that the singer could be taken to hospital for a ""save shot"" - typically administered to counteract the effects of an opiate.  Doctors wanted him to remain in hospital, but when they were unable to provide a private room Prince and his entourage left. His publicists have not responded to the claims."	1

Splash  On Friday, the two were spotted together at New York’s JFK Airport, with the Quantico actress looking super stylish in a baby pink outfit and white jacket.

"'Wonder Woman 2': Everything we know so far about the sequel, now delayed until summer 2020  Wonder Woman will be returning to save the day. But it's going to be a longer wait than we thought.  The sequel to director Patty Jenkins' critically acclaimed superhero film ""Wonder Woman"" is now set for release in 2020, Warner Bros. announced Monday. Here's everything else we know about ""Wonder Woman 2"":  1. The movie is now being released in summer, ""its rightful home.""  That's how star Gal Gadot spun the news that the next ""Wonder Woman"" is moving to June 5, 2020, the movie's third announced release date. The sequel had been scheduled for Nov. 1, 2019, and before that, Dec. 13, 2019.  2. The sequel is called ""Wonder Woman 1984"" and set in the same year.  At Comic-Con, Jenkins showed a clip of Gadot's Diana taking on bad guys and saving children in a retro mall.  ""When you dig into these eras, they as metaphors really symbolize things that are true always,"" she said, adding that the follow-up was set in the 1980s ""because it really was mankind at its best and worst. We’re aware of the prices of some of our behavior nowadays, but we weren’t in the '80s – we were at the top.""  3. Steve Trevor (played by Chris Pine) returns, despite his apparent death in the last movie.  It appeared that Steve Trevor, American pilot and Diana's love interest in the film, died in ""Wonder Woman."" But the character is back in ""Wonder Woman 1984,"" set nearly 70 years after the first film, and he looks as though he hasn't aged a day.  Pine deadpanned at Comic-Con, avoiding any movie spoilers on why his character is featured: ""I’m actually not even here right now. I’m an aura of emotional support for my pals.""  Trevor is a particularly meaningful character for Jenkins. The filmmaker said at a Women in Entertainment summit last November that he reminds her of her father, ""an American fighter pilot who, after the Vietnam War, was taken out of the armed forces and, coincidentally just like Steve does, flew for Europe doing allied combat where he played Russia. He passed away in a plane crash.""  4. Kristen Wiig is playing the villain Cheetah.  An early look at Wiig in the movie shows her surrounded by taxidermy in what appears to be a museum of natural history. We're going to take a wild guess and assume that Wiig's character, Barbara Minerva, is looking at a cheetah. Cheetah is Minerva's alter ego, who possesses superhuman strength and agility.  ""Narcos"" star Pedro Pascal also appears in the sequel; however, his role is unknown.  5. General Antiope (Robin Wright) will return, in flashbacks.  Wright confirmed in a Net-a-Porter interview that her fan-favorite Amazon leader will be a part of ""Wonder Woman 1984"": She shot a flashback sequence with Connie Nielsen's Queen Hippolyta. Antiope, Diana's aunt and Hippolyta's sister, sacrificed herself to save Diana in ""Wonder Woman.""  Contributing: Brian Truitt"	1

Photo: ABC  It’s hard to pinpoint the exact season when Bachelor and Bachelorette contestants shifted away from mostly lawyers, sales reps, and otherwise conventional careers in favor of embracing a medley of weird jobs. It’s been a trend since day one, and it was further amplified with the debut of the newest Bachelorette season, where our leading lady, Becca Kufrin, got seduced by suitors with esteemed titles such as “social media participant” and “colognoisseur.” What exactly do these entail? Please, guess away! (One of them involves cologne the fragrance, not Cologne the populous German city.) In honor of this duo officially joining the Ridiculous Bachelor Job Titles club, Vulture went back to the franchise’s 2002 debut and highlighted all of the weirdest jobs that have cropped up since, complete with photo evidence. It’s a fun stroll down memory lane, that’s for sure.  The Pet Shop Girls  Photo: ABC  Photo: ABC  It would’ve been even more interesting if they listed their favorite Animals song, to be honest.

You may want to cop your Gwen Stefani concert tickets right now, because her ‘Just a Girl’ Vegas residency could be her last run, ever! But why? — Check out her latest interview…  Did Gwen Stefani, 48, just reveal that she’s quitting music after her Just a Girl Las Vegas residency? Well, not quite. But, she did admit that she’s nearing the end of her music journey, and she’s OK with that! “I always think it’s fine if I never do it again,” she told OK magazine about performing. “Then when I get on stage, I’m like, ‘Oh my gosh, I love this!’ I love my music, I love being up there. It’s my gift — it’s what I’m here for. I’m obviously at the end of my journey of being a musician,” she continued.  When asked why she said her Vegas residency, Gwen admitted, “Well, because of my age, and I’ve been doing it for thirty-something-years.” She explained: “A Las Vegas show is a way to express myself and do my whole catalog of music that defines every period in my life, all the crises and all the joys. Creatively, I couldn’t have done it sooner; I have to have all these songs.”  The mag’s cover reads, “Gwen tells all: I’m Quitting Music For Blake!” However, that’s not exactly the case. Gwen explained to the mag that she’s had such a successful and long career, that she’s satisfied where she’s gotten within the business. In fact, she said that her boyfriend, Blake Shelton, 41, extremely supportive of her career.  The former No Doubt frontrunner‘s solo residency kicks off on June 27 at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino. As for what fans can expect? — Definitely prepare for her old hits, but get ready to hear some new songs about her beau, Blake Shelton! “Obviously he’s my best friend, so I’m bouncing stuff off him all the time, Gwen said, adding that Blake is “super supportive” of her career. “He gets me motivated. There are a bunch of songs about him in the show, that’s fun.”  Gwen also revealed the meaning behind her “Just a Girl” residency moniker. “If you really know me or saw how I grew up, I am 100 percent the same person I’ve always been,” she explained. “When I wrote that song, I was 25, going to college, living at my parents’. I guess I wanted to say, ‘This is my DNA.’ I’m just a girl from Anaheim, CA and I’ve never been anything else… And for a song to be relevant 20 years later? … It still works!”	0
Jennifer Aniston is reportedly talking ex-husband Brad Pitt through his divorce from Angelina Jolie.  According to People, the former couple – who divorced back in 2005 after five years of marriage – have been in contact recently.  “They have been friends for a while and often text,” a source told the mag. “This is nothing new, he didn’t have to jump through hoops to get Jennifer‘s number.”  Brad is currently in the midst of a custody battle with Angelina over their six children – Maddox, 15, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 10, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 8.  Jen is of course married to actor/director Justin Theroux and they stepped out at the 2017 Oscars together just this past weekend.	0
Kris Jenner 'has known for years' that her husband Bruce wanted to become a woman, it has been claimed.  A source close to the Jenner family told TMZ that the Kardashians are lying by claiming they knew nothing about his plans.  According to the report, Kris has known Bruce 'had issues with his sexual identity' for decades, and that his intention to have a sex change came to light years ago.  Scroll down for video...  Not letting on: Kris Jenner - pictured with Bruce here in Beverly Hills in 2012 - is said to have 'known for years' about him wanting to become a woman, according to a new report by TMZ  But the Kardashian matriarch supposedly demanded it was kept private because it would 'hurt the brand'.  Now the Jenners are said to be furious following a report last week which claimed the 59-year-old was somehow oblivious to the Olympian's situation - which she attributed to a serious lack of communication’  The pair had been married for almost a quarter of a century, tying the knot in 1991, with their divorce expected to be officially finalized next month.  In the dark?: The report claims Kris has been aware of her husbands feelings 'since they were married', despite recently claiming she knew nothing about it  Long time coming? A report by TMZ claims that Bruce had a 'sexual identity crisis' years ago  Crash: On Saturday the 65-year-old was involved in a fatal car crash in Malibu that left one person dead  On Saturday Bruce Jenner was involved in a fatal four car accident which left one person dead.  A 69-year-old neighbor of the family was killed after being rear-ended by Bruce's Cadillac Escalade Pacific Coast Highway in Malibu, Los Angeles, which then pushed her into the path of an on-coming Hummer. Police are checking phone records to see if he was texting at the time.  The incident will undoubtedly make the normally attention-hungry family even more media shy.  Wreckage: The victim of Saturday's has been named as 69-year-old Kim Howe, one of the former Olympian's neighbors  Tested: Police conducted a mandatory sobriety test, and are also investigating if any of the drivers involved were using their phones at the time  The Kardashians recently made the unprecedented decision not to promote the tenth season of their reality show, primarily in a bid to avoid questions about Bruce's gender swap.  It has been reported that the issue will be addressed in an upcoming episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians, which is due to return to screens this spring.  Meanwhile the gold medalist is said to be filming his own docu-series about the whole ordeal which will also run on E later this year.  United: Jenners daughters and adopted daughters Kylie, Kendall, Khloe, Kourtney and Kim are said to be in full support of his change, but are avoiding media questions on it	0

Asked by Blanchett why she wants to commit the crime, Bullock’s character replies: “Because it’s what I’m good at.”  Ocean’s 8 is released in UK cinemas on June 22.	1
'90s kids rejoice, it's time to return to Camp Waziyatah!  Bug Juice is officially returning to TV this summer, and now we have a premiere date. The revival, titled Bug Juice: My Adventures at Camp, will premiere Monday, July 16 at 7:30/6:30c on Disney Channel and it will continue to air on Monday and Thursday evenings after that.  Disney Channel's Bug Juice originally aired from 1998-2001, depicting the summer camp shenanigans of a group of kids at sleep away camp for weeks at a time. Summer romance, team building activities and campfires created a wholesome reality TV show for Disney, but it sadly lasted only three seasons.  The new season will look much different than you remember though, since this revival is geared towards kids of a new generation. That means emojis, boomerangs and memes will play a big part in the viewing experience, creating an updated feel for the show. Let's just hope these kids have to surrender their cells phones when they arrive at Waziyatah, or else this might be a bit of a boring watch...	1
Appearing on “The Late Show With Stephen Colbert” on Wednesday night, Rose McGowan claimed to be “the architect” of Harvey Weinstein’s downfall.  When Colbert asked about women beginning to come forward with sexual misconduct allegations against the Hollywood mogul starting six months ago, she replied that she came forward a year ago and helped orchestrate the movement to bring him down. She also said she “sees things” when asked about the spies Weinstein allegedly sent to quiet her.  In the strange interview spanning the Bible, George W. Bush, and khakis, McGowan, wearing an orange hoodie, also addressed her recent arrest on drug charges, saying, “Yes, I’ve had handcuffs on me, but no one else in this situation. Isn’t that grand?”  “I think we can do better, societally,” she added during another segment of the interview. “I think we can be looser, 10%, have more fun, be better, see more colors, run, and what are we doing? It’s not working out so well here. Am I wrong? There’s a bus on fire with a madman and a blindfold, and everyone’s still talking about it as if it’s nice. It’s not nice. It’s f—ing weird, right? Whoa. Shake it up because otherwise we’re all maybe gonna die sooner than we think.”  On Thursday, McGowan defended herself on Twitter from those criticizing the interview, tweeting “I just have a different personality than you. I don’t follow protocol. And I will talk about WHAT I WANT. I requested a Dick Cavett free form hangout.”  “I am unusual, that IS the point. I do not care for formats or traditional thought. Every interview of mine is different, just like a mood. A lot of you are meeting me for the first time. Don’t compare me to what you would do or be. Be free,” she said in another tweet.  2) I am bored of formats and questions. I am done with traditional structure. If you’re not with the fake tradition of traditional promotional “appearances” then by all means, stay in your square, but DO NOT APPLY TO ME . @TheAVClub — rose mcgowan (@rosemcgowan) February 1, 2018  I am unusual, that IS the point. I do not care for formats or traditional thought. Every interview of mine is different, just like a mood. A lot of you are meeting me for the first time. Don’t compare me to what you would do or be. Be free. — rose mcgowan (@rosemcgowan) February 1, 2018  Prior to appearing on Colbert, McGowan had a breakdown at a New York book signing for new memoir “Brave,” which centers on her Weinstein allegations and her journey as an activist. After a woman in the audience criticized her for not doing enough for transgender women, she responded, “So f—ing shut up. Please systemically. For once. In the world. You know what I’m talking about. Just tell the God damned truth. Stop boxing everybody into s—. I didn’t agree to your cis f—ing world. Ok? F— off.”  The actress has been making a number of TV appearances this week in promoting “Brave” and “Citizen Rose,” her new docuseries on E!. Also on Wednesday, McGowan replied through her publicist to Weinstein’s rebuttal of her accusation that the then-studio mogul raped her, standing by her statements.	1
E! has opted not to pick up a third season of its original scripted series The Arrangement. The show’s recent May 13 Season 2 finale served as a series finale.  Primetime-Panic Your Complete Guide to Pilots and Straight-to-Series orders See All  “Over two seasons, E!’s scripted series The Arrangement has taken viewers inside the world of an A-list movie star filled with secrets, scandal and romance,” a E! spokesperson said in a statement to Deadline. “While we have decided not to move forward with the series, we are incredibly grateful to the cast and our production partners.”  The Arrangement was one of two original scripted series on E! along with The Royals, whose fourth season aired alongside The Arrangement. The fate of that series, whose creator-showrunner Mark Schwahn was fired in December amid sexual harassment allegations, has not been decided.  On the scripted side, E! recently ordered the high-profile pilot Juicy Stories from Michael Patrick King.  The Arrangement was a breakout when it debuted in March 2017, averaging 1.3 million total viewers and 725,000 in the 18-49 demo in Live+3, and ranking as the year’s second-biggest scripted cable drama launch with young women (women 18-34). Its ratings slipped by double digits in Season 2, as did the ratings for its companion The Royals.  From Universal Cable Productions and writer/executive producer Jonathan Abrahams, The Arrangement starred Josh Henderson, Christine Evangelista, Lexa Doig and Michael Vartan in a Hollywood love story shedding light on the darker side of fame.	1
E! has given a fourth season greenlight to its hit series Total Bellas. The renewal comes as the series, which follows the lives of WWE superstars Nikki Bella and Brie Bella, finished its third season with its best numbers to date. Season 3 was its highest-rated season ever among all key demos, drawing nearly 1 million total viewers per episode, up 22% from the previous season among the core P18-49 demographic, according to the network and Nielsen.  Sunday night premieres of Total Bellas ranked among the Top 10 programs in primetime across ad-supported cable with W18-34 and W18-49. Season three also averaged more than 4MM social engagements a week, +123% higher average weekly engagements vs. Season 2 (1.8MM). Total Bellas currently has 1.1MM social followers, gaining +16% new followers during season three.  Season three of Total Bellas saw Nikki deciding to call off her high-profile wedding, Brie balancing being a new mom and a successful business woman with her sister, and Daniel Bryan’s sensational return to the WWE ring. The third season also gave viewers a glimpse into Nikki and Brie’s continued growth as entrepreneurs as they expanded their businesses and launched new brands.  “Nikki and Brie’s willingness to be open about their struggles and celebrate their triumphs with their fans is what makes ‘Total Bellas’ such a hit with our audience,” said Amy Introcaso-Davis, Executive Vice President, Development and Production, E! “The Bella Twins embody the strong, empowered women that we celebrate here at E!, and we are so excited to see what the future has in store for them next.”  “I’m so excited for another season of ‘Total Bellas’ and hope our journey continues to inspire, motivate and connect with our Bella Army,” said Brie Bella. “I can’t wait for our fans to join me in the next step of my life. I promise that it will be a fun, real and heartfelt adventure,” added Nikki Bella.  The Bella Twins also appear on E’s Total Divas, which premieres on September 19.  Total Bellas is produced by WWE and Bunim/Murray Productions with Gil Goldschein, Russell Jay and Farnaz Farjam Chazan serving as Executive Producers for Bunim/Murray Productions and Kevin Dunn serving as Executive Producer for WWE. Nikki Bella and Brie Bella also serve as Executive Producers.	1
"Pamela Anderson calls Tommy Lee 'a disaster' after fight with son  Following rocker Tommy Lee's allegation that son Brandon, 21, knocked him ""unconscious,"" mom Pamela Anderson is defending her son.  On Tuesday, Lee, 55, tweeted that he and fiancée Brittany Furlan, 31, ""were in bed when my son busted into the room and assaulted me. I asked him to leave the house and he knocked me unconscious. He ran away from the police. THAT’S the truth.""  Not so, said Anderson on Thursday, who also shares son Dylan, 20, with her ex-husband, to whom she was married from 1995 to1998.

More: Tommy Lee claims 21-year-old son Brandon Lee assaulted him  ""I pray Tommy gets the help he needs,"" she wrote. ""His actions are desperate and humiliating — he is a disaster spinning out of control. and he is not acting like a father.  But this is nothing new. My sons have made every attempt to help him in recent months - staying with him to make sure he’s OK. Just by being present with him they were hoping he’d feel loved and act differently.

""Though he’s made attempts to contact me. I have blocked him. ""It is impossible to reason with crazy.""  Anderson added that Brandon doesn't want his father to go to jail. But ""him blaming his son or us for anything is delusional."" Read her post here.          "	1

If you’re obsessed with the idea of Selena Gomez dating Niall Horan, then we’re here to burst your bubble. We’ve EXCLUSIVELY learned that she’s flattered by his childhood crush comment, but there’s one BIG reason why they’ll never get together.  It’s every guy’s worst nightmare to be put inside the friend zone. Unfortunately, that’s the case for Niall Horan, 23, who recently admitted in a radio interview with SiriusXM that Selena Gomez, 24, was his childhood crush. As much as we’d love to see these two start a romance, it’s not going to happen any time soon. “Selena really likes Niall but she feels a more brotherly connection towards him as opposed to a romantic one,” a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. “That’s why nothing has happened between them. She thinks he’s cute and all for what he said, but it’s not going any further than the comments.”  Plus, she’s happily taken with The Weeknd. After attending David Henrie, her Wizards Of Waverly Place co-star’s wedding, she’s starting to have ideas of her own about marrying the “Starboy” crooner. “It was a completely magical moment for her because she saw what true love was all about and realized that is what she has with The Weeknd,” a different insider EXCLUSIVELY told us. “Seeing David so happy made her think of what she has with Abel and how happy she is and is fully devoted to everything he has brought to her life. It just proved that The Weeknd is her dream man.” See, there’s barely any room for Niall in this picture.  As for the former One Direction singer’s dating life, we’re still waiting for a girlfriend to emerge from the shadows. Niall has been very secretive about his recent affairs and won’t even drop the name of the girl that “This Town” is based on. Instead of chasing after girls, he’s actually been spending more time with his band mates, like Liam Payne, who recently performed at the Wango Tango music festival. Their brief reunion was the cutest thing we’ve ever seen!  HollywoodLifers, are you bummed out that Selena and Niall won’t be dating any time soon?	0
The truth about Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle's relationship  Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle became sisters-in-law when the former Hollywood actress tied the knot with Prince Harry on May 19, 2018, effectively bumping Middleton's 2011 wedding to Prince William out of recent memory. However, Middleton and Markle had started getting to know one another back during the days of Markle and Harry's headline-making engagement, and they've no doubt only continued to learn more about one another as they've attended royal events together and grown their respective families.  But how close are they really? After all, it's not exactly common to forge a friendship while leading lives in the spotlight and keeping up with royal traditions. Let's take a closer look at the royal women's bond, and figure out the truth about how these two duchesses really feel about one another. We have a suspicion that there's more than meets the eye when it comes to Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle's relationship.	0

    Retail therapy! Selena Gomez stepped out in New York City on Tuesday, July 10, in a bold T-shirt after her ex Justin Bieber’s quick engagement to Hailey Baldwin.  The “Back to You” singer, 25, wore a $49 black Storets top that featured the phrase “Only the Strong Survive” written on its front pocket. She paired it with gray sweatpants, white sneakers and large black sunglasses. She appeared to be in good spirits while showing off her new long hair.  Gomez’s outing came three days after Bieber, 24, proposed to Baldwin, 21, while the couple were on vacation in the Bahamas. The model showed off her huge engagement ring while out and about with her new fiancé the next day.  The Grammy winner confirmed the news via Instagram on Monday, July 9, writing in part, “You are the love of my life Hailey Baldwin and I wouldn’t want to spend it with anybody else.” Baldwin later tweeted, “Not sure what I did in life to deserve such happiness but I am so utterly grateful to God for giving me such an incredible person to share my life with! No words could ever express my gratitude.”  The hashtag #SelenaIsFreeParty quickly became a worldwide trending topic on Twitter on Sunday, July 8, after the engagement news broke. “SHE. DON’T. NEED. A. MAN,” one of Gomez’s fans wrote. Another added, “She deserves all the love, respect and happiness. I’m so glad she’s feeling all confident and happy. And no more drama.”  However, a source told Us Weekly exclusively that the Wizards of Waverly Place alum has moved on from Bieber, whom she dated on and off from 2011 to 2014 and again from November 2017 until this March. “Selena doesn’t care,” the insider said. “She’s over Justin and the last time they broke up allowed her to get over him fully.”  For the latest TV news and interviews, subscribe to our new podcast “Watch With Us” below  	1

At long last, the A-list allure of Peak TV has brought George Clooney back to us. Hulu has released a first look at its upcoming adaptation of Joseph Heller’s Catch-22: a new round of photos featuring Clooney himself (taking a break from executive producing and directing), as well as Girls alum Christopher Abbott, Friday Night Lights fave Kyle Chandler, and more.  Debuting in spring 2019, the six-part limited series sees Abbott playing World War II Air Force bombardier Yossarian, who wants desperately to finish his service and leave military life behind. But requirements for his discharge are continually changing, and there’s a “hilariously sinister” Catch-22 rule that prevents servicemen from citing mental health as a reason to depart. As the series’ synopsis puts it, “a man is considered insane if he willingly continues to fly dangerous combat missions, but a request to be removed from duty is evidence of sanity and therefore makes him ineligible to be relieved from duty.”  In addition to Abbott’s role as Yossarian, Catch-22 also features Chandler as Colonel Cathcart, Clooney as Scheisskopf, House star Hugh Laurie as Major de Coverley, as well as additional cast that includes Giancarlo Giannini, Daniel David Stewart, Rafi Gavron, Jon Rudnitsky, Tessa Ferrer, Julie Ann Emery and more.

Jessica Szohr talked about the numerous sexual assault claims against her former “Gossip Girl” co-star and ex-boyfriend Ed Westwick in a new interview.  “It’s a difficult subject right now for anyone that’s involved on either side. I don’t even really know how to answer it, if I should, because I don’t want anything to get twisted, because I have known Ed for years and know how lovely he is, and don’t think he would ever put someone in a position like that,” Szohr said.  The actress, who dated her co-star between 2008 and 2010, said that the accusers could be alleging things that are not true: “It’s difficult, because you don’t want someone you know to go through that or do that to someone, or knowing them well, knowing that you don’t think they would, and you don’t want, for the girls that are coming forward, it’s like, are they stretching the truth?”  Despite her defense of Westwick, the “Shameless” actress said she’s glad survivors of sexual abuse are coming forward. “It’s just, it’s a touchy, tough thing that you pray it’s not true and that with, outside of even him, all these different topics coming up, I’m glad that there’s notice being put on it for women that are going through it.” .  “But I also think it’s a touchy, crazy thing too,” Szohr said, “because some people are going into these different situations and they’re not coming out true. So it’s like, well, why are people making it up, because that takes away from the girls that are going through it. And then it’s also hard to go back and try to get evidence from things that were so long ago.”  Jessica confirmed that she has been in contact with Westwick, who she described as having a “difficult time”: He’s being accused of something that he’s publicly saying he didn’t do. So it’s, you know, tough on him. His show got canceled.”  Szohr concluded, “I don’t know those girls at all, and they could be lovely and awesome and all that. From the Ed I know and working with him for five years and having a friendship through all of that and after, it was shocking. It was shocking.”  Westwick denied the accusations made by Kristina Cohen via Twitter. “I do not know this woman,” he wrote. “I have never forced myself in any manner, on any woman. I certainly have never committed rape.”  LAPD confirmed that they are conducting an investigation on Cohen’s claims and the BBC canceled the upcoming Agatha Christie special “Ordeal by Innocence”, starring the British actor, and halted production on the second season of his series’ “White Gold”.

"OSCAR-WINNING actress Jennifer Lawrence has suggested the devastating hurricanes in Texas and approaching Florida were signs of “Mother Nature’s rage and wrath” at America for electing Donald Trump and not believing in man-made climate change.  Lawrence, who is promoting her new drama Mother!, appeared on British network Channel 4, where she discussed topics ranging from the movie to the gender pay gap and Mr Trump.  “It’s scary,” the actress responded to the interviewer’s assertion that there was “an end-of-days feeling” across the world and especially in the US.  “You know, it’s this new language that’s forming. I don’t even recognise it. It’s also scary to know that climate change is due to human activity, and we continue to ignore it, and the only voice that we really have is through voting.”  “And you have voted very recently, as a country” the reporter noted – to which Lawrence replied that “it was really startling” Mr Trump was elected.  She then suggested the recent hurricanes devastating Texas and nearing Florida may have been prompted by Mr Trump winning the presidency.  “You know, you’re watching these hurricanes now, and it’s really hard, especially while promoting this movie, not to feel Mother Nature’s rage and wrath,” Lawrence said.  Lawrence later said the conversation topics of Mr Trump and US politics were “really polarising and upsetting.”  “You know, I’ve heard things and seen things on TV in my own country that devastate me and make me sick, and it’s just really confusing,” she said.  After being asked whether she finds Mr Trump confusing, the actress fired back, saying, “I don’t find him confusing. I think I know exactly what he is.”  Lawrence has never been shy about sharing her opinions on the President.  In 2015, when Trump had just launched his presidential campaign, she said a victory by him would “be the end of the world,” during an Entertainment Weekly interview.  Social media users were quick to hit out at the star for politicising a natural disaster.  What a dumbass!! Typical Hollywood snowflake.

"Actor Charlie Sheen has defended a Tweet in which expressed his hope that US president-elect Donald Trump will be the next celebrity to die.  The 51 year old former Two And A Half Men star posted a message on Twitter which read: ""Dear God, Trump next please!"" shortly after the death of actress Debbie Reynolds was announced.  He signed off the tweet with an emoji of a middle finger.  Dear God;    Trump next, please!  Trump next, please!  Trump next, please!  Trump next, please!  Trump next, please!  Trump next, please!    🖕🏾    © — Charlie Sheen (@charliesheen) December 29, 2016  Although many followers and Twitter users seemed to share his views, with over 47,000 retweeting the message there was also a considerable negative reaction to the message with many saying he had overstepped the mark.  @jlooksky @charliesheen It's sad enough people wish death upon people. — Justin Hasson (@justinthecookie) December 29, 2016  Following a number of news reports in the United States about his viral tweet, Sheen posted a second message on his Twitter account defending his comments.  ""The media's reaction to last night's tweet is inanely emblematic of the panoramic timorousness draped vastly and wantonly across any and all expressions of hope or joy that we now dare to publish or impart.  Oh and by the way, I was talking to God, not you.""  The comments represent somewhat of a change of tune for Sheen who said back in June that he would support Trump if he was elected.  In an interview with Piers Morgan at an event in London, he said: ""I think people just responded to something different, something fresh, something maverick, something innovative on some level.  ""If he gets in I've got to support him and hope he does the best job he can, and if he doesn't, then man - that was a hell of a run.""  Earlier this year he also shared a hilarious anecdote about the then Republican candidate when he appeared on The Graham Norton Show.  He said that Trump offered him a pair of platinum diamond cufflinks as a belated wedding gift on a night out, however the 'expensive' items turned out to be nothing more than cheap fakes.  Sheen told Norton that after the discovery ""I just thought, 'what does this say about the man?'"" and described Trump as a ""charlatan""."	0
PASADENA, Calif. — Get ready for Rose McGowan on the small screen.  Ms. McGowan, the actress turned activist whose accusations against Harvey Weinstein helped spur a national reckoning on sexual abuse and harassment, will star in a documentary series, “Citizen Rose,” that is scheduled to premiere on E! later this month.  “It is a time of reckoning and the reset button,” she said at a Television Critics Association media event on Tuesday.  The cable network promised that the series will be an unfettered look into Ms. McGowan’s life. Filming began in September, the month before the publication of the New York Times story that disclosed her settlement agreement with Mr. Weinstein, whom she had accused of sexual assault.  “She kept saying, ‘It’ll be worth it, I promise,’” Andrea Metz, an executive producer of the series, said of Ms. McGowan’s pitch to Bunim/Murray Productions.	1
Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Filming “Black Panther” in the South forced star Chadwick Boseman to recall painful memories of experiencing racism when he was a child.  “It’s not hard to find in South Carolina. Going to high school, I’d see Confederate flags on trucks,” Boseman told MR PORTER when asked if he ever faced racism growing up. “I know what it’s like to be a kid at an ice-cream shop when some little white kid calls you ‘n—-r,’ but your parents tell you to calm down because they know it could blow up. We even had trucks try to run us off the road.”  When Boseman, 41, had time off from filming the superhero film in Atlanta, he’d drive two hours to visit his family in South Carolina, where he realized there is still progress to be made.  “… I would see the Klan holding rallies in a Walmart car park,” Boseman said. “So it’s like we’re going forward and backward at the same time. People don’t want to experience change, they just want to wake up and it’s different. But this — shooting ‘Black Panther’ and then driving past the Klan — that’s what change feels like.”	1
"TV personality known for playing Bozo the Clown dies at 89  BOSTON (AP) — Longtime Boston television personality and entertainer Frank Avruch, who was the star of the popular children's TV program Bozo the Clown, has died. He was 89.  Avruch died Tuesday at his Boston home from heart disease, his family said in a statement to WCVB-TV .  Avruch played Bozo the Clown from 1959 to 1970, a clown character particularly popular in the U.S. in the 1960s because of widespread franchising in television. Avruch became the first nationally-syndicated Bozo the Clown.  ""He had a heart of gold,"" manager Stuart Hersh told The Associated Press on Wednesday, ""He brought the Bozo the Clown character to life better than anyone else's portrayal of Bozo the Clown.""  Avruch also was a contributor to WCVB-TV for more than 40 years as a host of Man About Town and The Great Entertainment.  Avruch passed away on Tuesday, March 20, 2018, of heart disease at his Boston home.  He was an active philanthropist and a board member of UNICEF'S New England chapter. He toured the world performing as Bozo the clown for UNICEF.  ""He touched so many people with his portrayal,"" Hersh said.  Avruch is survived by his wife Betty, two sons Matthew and Steven and several grandchildren.  ""While it's hard to say goodbye, we celebrate the legacy of joy and laughter he brought to millions of children around the world as Bozo the Clown on TV and as a UNICEF Ambassador and later as host of Channel 5's Great Entertainment and Boston's Man About Town,"" Avruch's family said in a statement to the station. ""Our dad loved the children of all ages who remembered being on his show and was always grateful for their kind words. We will miss him greatly."""	1
"I get it: Sometimes you want loose, undone waves, but whipping out your curling iron just feels a little extra (see also: time-consuming, hard, annoying...). But what if I told you you could create the perfect beach waves with a flat iron? Not only is it way easier than curling your hair, IMO, but it’s also a genius way to get just-rolled-out-of-bed waves à la Emily Ratajkowski or Lucy Hale without having to attend beauty school or watch, IDK, 30 hours of YouTube to master. Ahead, I gathered seven game-changing hacks that’ll immediately turn you into a hair-straightener convert.  Flat-Iron Beach Waves Hack #1: Add Texture  Got fine hair that doesn’t hold a curl, or silky-soft texture with zero grip? Whether you’re working with freshly washed hair or you’re going on day three, prep for flat-iron beach waves with a healthy spray of dry shampoo. And as with any heat styling, you’ll want to follow with a few spritzes of heat protectant to keep your hair nice and healthy. These top-rated formulas are a great place to start:  Flat-Iron Beach Waves Hack #2: Create ""S"" Waves    Kathleen Kamphausen/Lauren Ahn  If you’re after soft, lived-in waves (basically, the opposite of bouncy, Victoria’s Secret-esque curls), you’ll love this flat-iron technique. Start by picking up a section of your hair and dropping it (yup, drop it—bear with me) into the mouth of the flat iron to create your first bend. Then, with that same section, clamp your flat iron in the shape of an “S” to finish off the piece. You’ll repeat this motion throughout your hair, focusing on your ends for a natural-looking finish.  Not sure your hair-straightener is up to the task? Check out one of my personal faves, below:  Flat-Iron Beach Waves Hack #3: Twirl and Pull  Nomi Ellenson | Lauren Ahn  Nomi Ellenson | Lauren Ahn  For beachy waves that are slightly more defined, try the twirl-and-pull method. Holding your flat iron at an angle, insert an inch-wide section of hair between the clamps and turn the iron away from your face to create your first bend. Then, gently slide the iron a little way down the section of hair before twirling the iron away from your face again. You’ll repeat this method until you reach your ends—leave them relatively straight for an unfinished (yet cool) look. Once your entire head is done, run your fingers through the loose curls to make them more wave-like.  Flat-Iron Beach Waves Hack #4: Twist Away from Your Face  Kathleen Kamphausen/Lauren Ahn  This technique is especially great for longer hair, since you can actually get a fairly bouncy wave out of it. Using a , feed a 1-inch section of hair (starting close to the nape of your neck, eventually working up toward your hairline) between the clamps. From there, in one fluid motion—or else you’ll end up with crimps—twist your wrist away from your face so the hair flows over (not under) the iron. Make sure the hair continues to wrap around the flat iron’s shell as you pass through your ends. Pro tip: The smaller the section, the curlier your hair will be.  Flat-Iron Beach Waves Hack #5: Bend Your Wrist  Nomi Ellenson | Lauren Ahn  Not super down for a time-consuming technique? This quick hack of simply bending your wrist back and forth will give you subtle beach waves. You’ll want to hold your hair out horizontally from your head and turn your wrist away as you pass through the section, then bend your wrist back toward your hair for some soft texture.  Flat-Iron Beach Waves Hack #6: Start with a Braid  Kathleen Kamphausen  An equally low-effort technique, this hack begins with a super-simple braid. After spritzing your braid with a , gently run the flat iron over it a few times. When you undo your braid, you’ll be left with perfectly crimped beach waves.    Flat-Iron Beach Waves Hack #7: Protect Your Waves with Pin Curls  Nomi Ellenson | Lauren Ahn  If you’re going to take the time to create flat-iron waves, you may as well make sure they last overnight (nobody wants to restyle their hair in the morn"	1

"Who else spent a solid chunk of their formative years unearthing lesser-known tidbits about their favorite celebrities by way of E! True Hollywood Story? Fans of the original docu-series — which saw its heyday during the late-90s, early-2000s era — will probably be pretty pumped to learn that E! True Hollywood Story is coming back, per a recent announcement from the network revealing its current roster of forthcoming programming. On Tuesday, May 1, E! unveiled its plans for a revamp of the popular documentary-style syndicate in a statement, saying,  E! True Hollywood Story will return with a fresh approach and new episodes that dive deep into the most compelling personalities and stories that are shaping headlines.  While E! hasn't released too many details regarding the specifics of its upcoming True Hollywood Story revamp, if its Tuesday statement is any indication, it certainly looks like the reboot series has some serious nostalgia in store for fans of the original show. That being said, per the network's recent statement, E! True Hollywood Story also seems poised to tout some additional contemporary flair — an inevitable byproduct, it would seem, of changing tides in Hollywood, as well as pop culture at large.  Speaking to that point, Amy Introcaso-Davis, the Executive VP of production and development over at E!, called E! True Hollywood Story ""a beloved franchise that has never been more timely and relevant"" in the network's recent statement about its upcoming programming slate. While Introcaso-Davis didn't elaborate on that particular comment, it's not too difficult to understand what she might have been getting at. Given the truth-telling trend that has cropped up across the film and television industry over the last eight months or so (largely in conjunction with the rise of the Time's Up movement), it seems like there's arguably no better time to revive a franchise whose original M.O. aimed to provide viewers with the ""inside scoop"" as to what's really going on in Hollywood.  Just in case anyone out there needs a little brush-up on their THS knowledge, here's a quick history lesson: E! True Hollywood Story kicked off its original run in early 1996 with an hour-long documentary-style episode that delved into the infamous murder of actress and model Rebecca Schaeffer. The show was originally billed for a series of periodic tv specials, though it was quickly picked up as a regular weekly series.  Throughout its proximate near-decade run, E! True Hollywood Story covered a whole host of celebrity-centric topics, including industry scandals, notorious Hollywood mysteries, and ""Where are they now?"" pieces examining the current lives of former child stars. (Anyone else remember that heartbreaking Macaulay Culkin episode?) Besides Culkin, the original series' biopic-like episodes explored the so-called ""behind-the-scenes"" lives of a roster of the era's A-list Hollywood luminaries, including Lindsay Lohan, Drew Barrymore, and Britney Spears, among many, many others.  In its Tuesday statement, the network offered a glimpse (albeit, in pretty broad strokes) into what a revamped episode of True Hollywood Story might look like. Because, while the upcoming revamped series sounds like its going to operate under the same general parameters as the original, E!'s statement said that the new series will be taking a ""modern approach"" to its narratives — a conceivable attempt to do what the network described in its statement as ""providing a voice to the moments that are reshaping popular culture.""  Expanding on that idea a bit, the network also offered a slightly more robust explanation as to how True Hollywood Story's newly-minted episodic structure is going to work, saying,  Each self-contained documentary will explore a topic, headline, or person that became the ground zero for a revolution, change or shift in culture, told by the people who were on the front lines of the story.  At this point, it's difficult to theorize about which bu"	1

YouTuber Shane Dawson is apologizing for jokes he made several years ago on the subject of pedophilia.  On Wednesday, the YouTube channel “Pop Blast” posted an edited clip of Dawson from an old podcast with the title “I think Shane Dawson is a pedophile. Here’s my proof.”  RELATED: Celebs Slam Logan Paul Over Another Insensitive And Disrespectful Video From Japan Trip  In the accusation video, Dawson, who has 11 million subscribers, jokes about babies being “sexy.”  Dawson posted his response later that day, apologizing for the nature of his humour back. He played the full podcast clip in context, making clear his remarks were simply tasteless jokes.  “I went to Google and I didn’t want to see child porn. I just wanted to see, let me pretend I’m a pedophile for a second,” Dawson said in the clip. “So I typed in ‘naked baby’. First of all, I don’t understand why anybody would be turned on by that. But, they were sexy. I’m kidding.”  In his 14-minute response video, Dawson said, “I wanted to play that clip in full—that moment especially in full—just for context because that seems to be missing nowadays. I can’t believe I’m having this make this video.”  “I’m going to start by saying I’m not a f***ing pedophile. I go on record saying I am not a f***ing pedophile. Got it? Great. There’s my statement. It’s disgusting that people are saying I’m a f***ing pedophile because of some s***ty ass f***ing jokes from six years ago on a podcast.”  Dawson then apologized for his old YouTube and podcast work.  “I’m sorry that I used to make really s***ty f***ing jokes. I’m sorry that I was so f***ing insecure and playing this character of this guy who’s crazy and will say anything and tries to make people laugh by shocking them. That was my thing. That is what I did on YouTube,” Dawson said.  “Back in the day, 2008 – 2012-ish, that was my thing. I loved the feeling of making somebody shocked and laugh because they couldn’t believe what was coming out of my mouth. I wasn’t confident enough to make smarter jokes. I was making the easy jokes… I was doing some f***ed up comedy stuff that I’m not proud of.”  RELATED: Logan Paul Removed From YouTube Top Content Package  The “Pop Blast” channel, which posted the accusation video, has been terminated by YouTube “due to multiple or severe violations of YouTube’s policy against spam, deceptive practices, and misleading content or other Terms of Service violations.”	1

"Shannon Beador is starting off this season of The Real Housewives of Orange County in the midst of one of the hardest things anyone would ever have to go through: divorce.  The last time we saw Shannon at the Season 12 RHOC reunion, she had announced that she and her husband, David Beador, had separated after 17 years of marriage. This season of RHOC kicks off as Shannon is in the midst of divorce proceedings with David. She officially filed for divorce from David on December 1, 2017.  Even though Shannon is still going through the process of divorce today, she said she is in a much better place than when we last saw her during that emotionally raw reunion. ""Life today at this very moment couldn't be better. I am honestly happy. And it's not me trying to convince anybody that I'm happy. I'm happy,"" she told The Daily Dish during an interview in New York City Monday. ""I pinch myself sometimes. I'm so grateful and blessed for the things that are going on in my life and for the people that I have in my life right now. So things are very good.""  It took Shannon some time and a lot of soul searching to get to this positive place. ""After the reunion when we officially announced the separation, it was difficult for me because even though we had been separated for a little over a month, it had become public, and now everybody knew about it. It just made it real to me,"" she said. ""So there was a long period of sadness and a lot of tears and a lot of pain. And I had to process through that pain. And I think that I emerged from it by literally staying home and learning to be happy with myself, that I came out a stronger person. And I know that whether I found another partner or not, I'm gonna be OK standing on my own. It's all a blessing.""      These days, however, Shannon is still working on her relationship with David. ""My relationship with David today is no bueno. It is not good. Hopefully when we settle everything there will be more of a friendliness,"" Shannon said. ""But my kids are doing well, as well as can be expected. We're trying to co-parent. They're spending a lot of time with their dad. We're trying to do it 50/50, and I want him to be a part of their lives.""  Luckily, Shannon has had her fellow OC Housewives, many of whom have gone through or are going through a divorce of their own, to lean on during this difficult time. ""Tamra [Judge], Vicki [Gunvalson], and Kelly [Dodd] have been so supportive throughout this whole divorce process. Tamra and Vicki, they've been through it before. Even though you walk through a divorce and say, 'It's gonna be positive. We're gonna be amicable,' they've pointed out, yeah we all go through, but there's gonna be a point where it's gonna turn, and they were absolutely correct. And to be able to have somebody kind of hold my hand through that and give me their insight as to what they did when the same things happened, it was invaluable,"" Shannon explained. ""And then also, then you go to Kelly, who's basically going through the same thing I'm going through at the same time. So to have that support system, and to also have a friend who lives 5 minutes from me that I'm able to go and do things with all the time, that's nice.""  After launching her Real for Real cuisine food line on QVC in April, Shannon is definitely ready to see what this next chapter of her life has in store. ""I've launched a business. This opportunity came to me right after the separation. It's like all of the stars were in alignment,"" she said. ""God has an amazing plan for me. I can't wait to see where.""  Shannon makes a big step in moving forward with her post-divorce life in the RHOC Season 13 premiere. Be sure to tune in Monday, July 16 at 9/8c to see what's new with Shannon, and check out the preview, below."	1
"|  Angelina Jolie is calling off her divorce from Brad Pitt, according to a shocking story from Globe. The magazine reports she's ready to reunite with her estranged husband out of desperation.  In the wake of a judge warning Jolie she could lose physical custody of their kids if she doesn't facilitate a better relationship between the children and their father, the outlet explains the actress believes the only way to keep full custody of her kids is to get back together with Pitt and stop their divorce proceedings. ""She's doing her best to mend her fractured relationship with Brad and become a family again,"" reveals an insider.  But while the publication describes Jolie as ""blindsided"" by the judge's ruling and in a panic over future access to her kids, the actress has been carrying on just fine. She recently went on a humanitarian trip to Iraq, has been filming Maleficent 2, and even took her children to Wicked on London's West End. Gossip Cop can also confirm she's made no effort towards reconciling with Pitt.  It should also be noted that this same tabloid falsely claimed Jolie and Pitt were getting back together in June. In that version of the narrative, their supposed reunion had nothing to do with avoiding custody issues, but was because they were allegedly still in love with each other. The truth then and now is that the divorce is still very much on."	0

Prince William and Kate Middleton, along with their two children Prince George and Princess Charlotte, are on a whirlwind European tour, and it seems everywhere they turn they make headline news. But rarely does it make a food magazine website's headline news. Until now! Because Prince William and Duchess Kate have added a twist to their travels—and a salty one at that.  After their arrival in Germany, the royal couple were treated to a class in hand-rolling pretzels at a market in Heidelberg, because if you went to Germany and didn't learn how to make a pretzel, what's the point? Dressed in a bright yellow Jenny Packham lace dress and a golden-pretzel-branded apron, Kate dove right in, while it took Wills a bit longer to catch on. Has she made pretzels (a complicated, days long, sort of dangerous process that can involve lye) before? Probably not, but she was rolling with the best of them.  It seemed everyone, including the many spectators and local bakers who came to help/watch, had a great time laughing and rolling, rolling and laughing, clapping for Prince William when he finally was able to untangle himself from the dough and present his carb-filled masterpiece. It was a photo op, after all. The couple later got a lesson in making candy, which seemed to fare a bit better. See below for Prince William and Kate Middleton Prepare Local Foods: a story in four parts.  Chris Jackson - Pool/Getty Images  From the start, you can see the look in Prince William's eyes that says: Oh no. I'm not wearing the right hat for this.  Chris Jackson/Getty Images  Kate throws her head back in a triumphant laugh—notice how literally everyone else in the photo is looking at her, except for the second guy from the right, who sees William, and appears to pity him.  Chris Jackson/Getty Images  The struggle is real. Meanwhile, Kate contemplates a life of professional pretzel-making. She lets out a laugh—oh right, the aprons! She reconsiders.  Chris Jackson - Pool/Getty Images  Hooray, the photo op is over and does anyone even get to eat the pretzels? We're left with so many questions.

The Originals is getting The Vampire Diaries treatment. Exactly a year after the end date for The Vampire Diaries was announced, The Originals creator/showrunner Julie Plec unveiled that the upcoming fifth season of the TVD spinoff will be its last.

And for being a part of something that I’ll treasure forever. Love Ben,” Macklemore – aka Ben Haggerty – writes in comments on YouTube.  Schott, who lives in Modesto, is brought to tears when she opens her front door to see her famous grandson standing there.  “Oh my God, what are you doing here, honey?” she exclaims, telling him later, “You made me cry.”  She asks him what he wants to do. “You want to go outside and have a drink? No, you don’t drink. Just me. I took up your habits,” she says, laughing.  “Today, we’re going to do whatever you want to do,” he says.  “Anything?” she says. “Oh God, I want to do it all.”  And they darn nearly do it all.  They egg someone’s house. (Then Grandma flips the bird toward her unseen nemesis.)  They’re off to buy sensible shoes. (Granny wants Yeezys instead, and gets them.)  They sing karaoke, play games at the arcade, race through the grocery store in electric shopping carts and Schott watches her grandson get another tattoo. This one says, “Helen.”  And, of course, they stop at the thrift shop.  Back home, Macklemore has one more surprise for his grandma – a fireman stripper.  Awwww. What a good grandson, the internet has declared.  It seems Macklemore has unleashed a tsunami of grandma love.  “Sweetest music video I’ve seen!” writes one YouTube commenter. “Makes me wish my grandma was still alive and well to go on adventures with.

Advertisement  Before that she had not made public any details of her pregnancy and had not even confirmed she was expecting.  Jenner apologised to fans for ""keeping you in the dark"" and said she kept the pregnancy private because she needed to ""prepare for this role of a lifetime in the most positive, stress free, and healthy way I knew how"".

He was arrested after his concert and police claimed he ""encouraged people to rush the stage"" but his lawyer said video footage did not support the allegations so other charges of inciting a riot and endangering the welfare of a minor were dismissed.

"ANN ARBOR, Mich., July 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Domino's Pizza (NYSE: DPZ), the recognized world leader in pizza delivery and digital ordering platforms, realizes that Cow Appreciation Week may exist only in the minds of those who truly love cheese as much as we do, and that's OK.

"Ashley Judd calls James Franco's sexual misconduct allegation response 'terrific'  James Franco's responses to his sexual misconduct allegations have not gone unnoticed by Ashley Judd.  In an interview clip with HARDtalk's Stephen Sackur Friday, the actress and vocal supporter of the #MeToo movement praised Franco for being accountable for his actions.  “I think that what James said is terrific,” Judd told the BBC journalist. “And I think that we’ve all behaved, at a certain level, unconsciously, and done things that were insensitive, inappropriate, without necessarily understanding that they were. I mean, we’ve all operated with a certain amount of tone deafness, and I like the culpability, and we have to have restorative justice.”  Judd continued, adding the importance of men and women coming together.  ""This is about men and women being all together and having a more equitable and just workplace, home life, social spaces. I mean, we know that when women are empowered in the workplace and are in decision-making positions that workplaces have better financial outcomes and there's less harassment when there is more diversity. And it takes that kind of individual accountability to collectively make the change on a large scale.""  Franco addressed the allegations against him during an interview with Stephen Colbert on The Late Show Tuesday.  ""I pride myself on taking responsibility for things that I’ve done,"" Franco said. ""The things I heard that were on Twitter are not accurate, but I completely support people coming out and being able to have a voice, because they didn’t have a voice for so long. So, I don’t want to shut them down in any way. It's, I think, a good thing, and I support it.""  The following day, the Los Angeles Times published a bombshell report in which five women accused him of sexually exploitative behavior.  The full interview with Judd airs on BBC World News on Sunday at 6:30 p.m. ET."	1
After Jimmy Fallon called on his fans Wednesday to share their funny or embarrassing prom stories for a segment on “The Tonight Show,” he got the ball rolling with an incredible throwback photo. Let’s turn back the clock a few decades and see what Fallon looked like at his own prom.  My date didn't tell me she was getting a tan and high heels for the prom. Standing next to her I looked so pale and so small. #PromFail pic.twitter.com/vnbZqLr6w6 — jimmy fallon (@jimmyfallon) May 3, 2017  Poor youthful, pre-fame Jimmy. Your adult self feels badly for you.  “My date didn't tell me she was getting a tan and high heels for the prom. Standing next to her I looked so pale and so small. #PromFail,” Fallon, 42, wrote.  It’s a moment he thinks about every now and then. In 2013, he posted the same photo and joked, “My date went tanning the night before. I did not. I looked like Powder.”  RELATED: Watch these kids try to explain to Jimmy Fallon what their parents do for work  That same year, he posted these pics from another prom.

"Kate Middleton's pregnancy and Prince Harry's engagement with his girlfriend Meghan Markle have been making news for some time. While the British family have confirmed a third baby is on the way, fans are curious to know when the engagement news will be announced.  Rumour has it that Meghan Markle has met the Queen and is preparing to relocate to London soon. The engagement news is expected to come anytime soon. But a report suggests it's being pushed back due to Middleton's pregnancy.  Also Read: Prince Harry-Meghan Markle engagement: Suits actress begins relocation to London?  According to sources of Life & Style, Prince Harry had to put a hold on the announcement because all eyes were on Middleton's third baby and he wants all attention on Markle when the announcement is made.  ""Harry had hoped to officially announce his engagement to Meghan shortly after they returned from their three-week holiday in Botswana at the end of August,"" a source told the magazine. But, ""Kate's pregnancy has overshadowed everything else,"" another insider shared. ""The timing of these things is all-important.""  ""Harry wants all eyes to be on Meghan [Markle] when they announce their engagement, but right now everyone is talking about Kate,"" the source told the magazine.  Apparently, Prince Harry had plans of marrying the Suits actress sometime before Christmas. ""[The couple] hoped to marry just before Christmas, but now it's all up in the air,"" the insider claims.  Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have ""apologized to Harry for messing up his plans. They know how much he wants to get married,"" the insider says.  It is not just Harry but Meghan also wants to get married soon because she ""is feeling her biological clock ticking. Harry and Meghan can't wait to have children, but Queen Elizabeth II would be furious if Meghan got pregnant without a ring on her finger,"" the insider adds.  As of now, many royal fans are expecting the news about their engagement to drop sometime around The Invictus Games which will see Prince Harry and Meghan Markle making their first public appearance together. The games will take place from September 23 to 30. So, royal fans, when do you think that the news will drop? Let us know in the comments section."	0

"Kim Kardashian is NOT upset about Kanye West working on a cosmetics line, despite a seemingly fabricated report. Gossip Cop can exclusively bust the story.  ""Kim Kardashian Worried Kanye West Is Working Too Hard With New Cosmetics Line,"" HollywoodLife announces in a purported ""exclusive."" It says in the accompanying story, ""Uh oh! Workaholic Kanye West has grand plans to launch a new cosmetics line, but it has wife Kim Kardashian terrified he's stretching himself too thin.""  The site asserts, ""Coming just a few months after his breakdown that led to an eight-day psychiatric hospitalization, his wife Kim Kardashian is scared about what taking on all this extra work could do to his mental healing."" A so-called ""source"" is quoted as telling the webloid, ""Kanye's grand plans for business have Kim worried for Kanye's health. Things have been good between Kim and Kanye lately and she admires his ambition, but his latest venture in cosmetics has Kim worried for her husband's health.""  Yes, that repetitious quote sounds entirely natural. This (quite possibly fictional) ""source"" continues, ""She does not want Kanye over-worked or stressed over business deals or involved in anything that could affect his sensitive health situation."" Adds the (quite possibly invented) tipster, ""Kim wants Kanye to spend more time with her and the children and less time starting new businesses.""  Here's what's going on: TMZ recently reported that West wanted to trademark ""Donda,"" his late mother's name, for a cosmetics line. Hours later, HollywoodLies magically managed to have ""exclusive"" information all about it, including Kardashian's supposed reaction to his plans. But Gossip Cop has repeatedly been told that the disreputable outlet doesn't have real sources when it comes to the couple.  In fact, after HollywoodLife made up stories about Kardashian's robbery, we learned that the weloid doesn't even bother to fact-check its ""exclusives"" with the reality star's camp, instead choosing to publish unverified ""fabrication[s]."" And that appears to be what's happened here. A rep for Kardashian exclusively tells Gossip Cop the allegation she's upset with West is ""false."""	0

Jessica Chastain is on the cover of WSJ. Magazine‘s Talents & Legends issue.  Here’s what the Molly’s Game actress had to share with the mag:  On how her past informs her choices: “My mom was a single mom; I don’t know who my biological father is, and I grew up in a household that was really financially unstable. There was a turning point in my life where we were living with someone I didn’t like very much, a boyfriend of my mom’s. And he did something�”my room was messy or whatever and he had taken my clothes, and I was telling him to give me back my stuff �”and he slapped me. And I just kicked him in the genitals, and he fell to the ground immediately. It was me, my sister and my brother�”and I remember looking at my sister’s face, and we were both like, ‘Oh, my God, what did I just do?’ And then I ran out of the house. But I always look back on that moment as knowing that, OK, if anything happens to me, I’m capable of fighting back. He never messed with me again. If you allow a bully to intimidate or victimize you, they’ll continue to do it. Bullies are actually weak; they don’t go after strong people.”  On how Harvey Weinstein introduced her once: “He actually told the audience, ‘If I had to get in a boxing ring with Muhammad Ali or Jessica Chastain, I would choose Muhammad Ali.’”  On her husband Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo: “I never wanted to get married. When I first met my husband, he knew that marriage wasn’t something I was interested in. And then as we got to know each other, the idea of marriage shifted for me. There are some things worth celebrating�”and he’s worth celebrating. I actually love being married. I never thought I would, but this is a spectacular human being, and I am celebrating that I get to share my life with him.”  For more from Jessica, visit WSJ.com.	1

"Ed Sheeran is a celebrated name in the music industry and people from around the world confide in, dance to and revel in his songs. We all love the man, right?  That's why his hiatus from social media stunned us all exactly two years ago on this day.  The British singer-songwriter with unfathomable popularity and love on a global level shocked his fans by sharing about his digital detox on Instagram.  He announced a break from what many people deem as an inseparable part of life, 'phone, email and social media'. His post read:  A year ago, he talked about how life's different and better in ways he did not imagine post this decision. Keeping his cell phone at bay proved to be so liberating that he now has completed two years without it.  Can you imagine going two days without your phone?  The acclaimed singer re-posted the message on Instagram and captioned it as, ""2 years since I ditched my phone x"".  Earlier this year, he had revealed that tossing his phone was a New Year's resolution in an attempt to decrease stress on The Ellen DeGeneres Show.  He said, ""I bought an iPad, and then I just work off of email, and it's so much less stress. I don't wake up in the morning and have to answer 50 messages of people asking for stuff. It's just like, I wake up and have a cup of tea.""  Sounds peaceful, right? Yet we are hooked onto social media like it's our lifeline.  Sheeran told E! News about this break from the spotlight recently. He said, ""I feel like life is all about balance, and my life wasn't balanced. Taking it all off the scale balanced it, oddly enough.""  He even deleted Twitter this July over what he described a ""headfuck"" due to brutal internet trolls. He had explained, ""I go on it and there's nothing but people saying mean things. One comment ruins your day.""  Would you dare to ditch your phone?"	1
"About Jim Bob and Michelle  Jim Bob & Michelle Duggar married July 21st, 1984. At that time, they chose to use the birth control pill. They thought, “We don’t want children right now. We can’t afford them. We want children in our timing, when we’re ready.” Four years later they decided to have their first child. Then, Michelle went back on the pill, but she conceived and had a miscarriage. At that point they talked with a Christian medical doctor and read the fine print in the contraceptives package. They found that while taking the pill you can get pregnant and then miscarry. They were grieved! They were Christians! They were pro-life! They realized that their selfish actions had taken the life of their child.  They prayed and asked God to forgive them, and to teach them to love children like He loves children. They asked God to bless them with as many children as He saw fit in His timing. Right after that Michelle got pregnant with twins! To date they have been blessed with 19 children, (10 boys and 9 girls) Joshua (& wife Anna), Jana & John-David (twins), Jill, Jessa, Jinger, Joseph, Josiah, Joy-Anna, Jedidiah & Jeremiah (twins), Jason, James, Justin, Jackson, Johannah, Jennifer, Jordyn-Grace and Josie.  God has opened many doors for them to share that children are a blessing from the Lord! To date they have been featured on five Discovery Health & TLC documentaries entitled, “14 Children and Pregnant Again!”, “16 Children and Moving In!”, “Raising 16 Children!”,“On The Road With 16 Children!” & ""Duggar's Big Family Album"". They have appeared on numerous National and International TV shows including The Early Show, The Today Show, The View,Fox & Friends, Italian Public Television, KBS (Korean Broadcasting System),Discovery Home & Health (UK & Australia), Jimmy Kimmel Live, Fox News Network, CNN, MSNBC and others.

The Duggar’s desire is to make Christ known and for others to see that the Bible is the owner’s manual for life."	1

Her biggest commercial success came with the fantasy picture Maleficent (2014). In the 2010s, Jolie expanded her career into directing, screenwriting, and producing, with the war dramas In the Land of Blood and Honey (2011), Unbroken (2014), and First They Killed My Father (2017).  In addition to her film career, Jolie is noted for her humanitarian efforts, for which she has received a Jean Hersholt Humanitarian Award and made an honorary Dame Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (DCMG), among other honors. She promotes various causes, including conservation, education, and women's rights, and is most noted for her advocacy on behalf of refugees as a Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).  As a public figure, Jolie has been cited as one of the most influential and powerful people in the American entertainment industry. For a number of years, she was cited as the world's most beautiful woman by various media outlets, and her personal life is the subject of wide publicity. She is divorced from actors Jonny Lee Miller, Billy Bob Thornton and Brad Pitt; she and Pitt have six children together, three of whom were adopted internationally.  Early life and family  Born Angelina Jolie Voight in Los Angeles, California, she is the daughter of actors Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand. She is the sister of actor James Haven, and the niece of singer-songwriter Chip Taylor[5] and geologist and volcanologist Barry Voight.[6] Her godparents are actors Jacqueline Bisset and Maximilian Schell.[7] On her father's side, Jolie is of German and Slovak descent,[8][9] and on her mother's side, she is of primarily French Canadian, Dutch, and German ancestry.[8] Like her mother, Jolie has stated that she is part Iroquois,[10] although her only known indigenous ancestors were 17th-century Hurons.[8][11]  After her parents' separation in 1976, Jolie and her brother lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children.[12] Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require her to go to church.[13] As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting,[14] though at age five she had a bit part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982).[15] When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York;[16] they returned to Los Angeles five years later.[12] Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.  Jolie first attended Beverly Hills Hi"	1
Debra Messing and John Cho star in the groundbreaking new thriller Searching, which is generating serious buzz for how it was made.  The entire story unfolds entirely through the POV of technology screens - video chats, Google searches, text messages and the like. While the original take on how this film was made is now the talk of Hollywood at first it made both actors reluctant to get involved.  John even turned down the role before the director won him over and Debra explained to EurWeb why she eventually signed on, saying:  “I really believe in instinct and I believe in trying to silence the voice that says, ‘what will other people think about this choice’ and does this excite me, will this challenge me, does it scare me? You answer yes to those, you have to do it.”  Searching is in theaters today.	0

Garner garnered (ha) attention at the awards ceremony when, during enthusiastic applause, she gave a stunned look and stopped clapping. The reaction became a meme, as these things do, and the public began speculating why Garner looked so upset. One theory involved Garner realizing that Caleb Landry Jones is a provocative and brilliant creative force. (Disclosure: That was my theory.) Another involved Garner realizing she'd forgotten to take the chicken out to thaw.	1
She's been subjected to a barrage of hate messages from Harry Styles' fans following reports of their rumoured romance.  So whilst she initially refused to draw any attention to the claims, Tess Ward has broken her silence in a bid to stop the slew of abuse.  Speaking to The Times, the 27-year-old food blogger revealed she had been forced to delete several of her social media accounts, leaving her solely with Instagram, although she admitted she was beginning to resent that too.  Scroll down for video  Lashing out: She's been subjected to a barrage of hate messages from Harry Styles' fans following reports of their rumoured romance, and Tess Ward has now spoken out  She explained: 'At the moment, I'm getting a lot of direct messages there, but I respectfully chose not to reply to them, because they're all... interesting. I want a break!'  Dubbing the hate messages 'very bizarre', she reasoned: 'I'm not the kind of person who's interested in fame and if you're put in an environment which you don't understand and you can't control and you don't want, it's horrible.'  Refusing to stoke the flames, when asked outright if she was dating Harry, Tess sighed: 'I literally don't have anything to say about that.'  Rumoured beau: Tess all but confirmed her romance with Harry Styles (pictured) this week, when the Naked Diet chef was seen supporting the singer at an intimate London gig  Tess and Harry all but confirmed their romance this week, when the Naked Diet chef was seen supporting the singer at an intimate London gig.  Following the reports, Tess took to her Instagram account to plead with her new batch of Instagram followers - now swollen to almost 130,000 - to 'be kind' to her in light of her blossoming relationship with the 23-year-old heartthrob.  Sharing a snapshot of an egg-and-avocado salad, she cooed about having brunch for dinner, before adding: 'For everyone following and messaging me, I am thankful but please be kind to me. All I want is to share beautiful food with you all.' [sic]  Can't stand the heat: The 27-year-old food blogger revealed she had been forced to delete several of her social media accounts after receiving abuse from Harry's fans  Making a meal of it: Tess recently took to her Instagram account to plead with her new batch of Instagram followers - now swollen to almost 130,000 - to 'be kind' to her  The pair were first linked earlier this month, after Tess was seen in Harry's Audi as he drove through London and she appeared to fuel romance rumours by stepping out in the exact same Gucci shirt as the former X Factor star.  It is said the pair were introduced by mutual friends and Harry is said to be 'besotted' with the food blogger.  A source told The Sun: 'As soon as Harry met Tess there was an instant spark between them. They really bonded over their mutual love of quirky fashion and food – and things turned romantic quickly.  'They've been on a number of dates... This really seems different to Harry’s past relationships as Harry genuinely is besotted with Tess and doesn’t want to risk messing this one up.'	1
"It’s been nearly one week since the release of Demi Lovato's newest album, Tell Me You Love Me and fans are still trying to decipher the meaning behind some of the album’s songs.  While Demi recently revealed the personal experiences that inspired the track “Daddy Issues,” she remains tight-lipped on the meaning of “Ruin the Friendship.” During an appearance on The Ellen DeGenres Show, Ellen tried her best to get Demi to confirm fan speculation that the track is about Nick Jonas.  “Supposedly there’s a song about Nick Jonas in here and because you claim to be so honest, I feel like you should be honest with that answer,” Ellen said. Demi responded to the question with a laugh and then said, “you know, something that I always keep to myself is who I write my songs about.”  Questions from fans about the song’s subject date back earlier this year. Initially, with only the track’s title to go on, fans wondered whether the track could be about one of the Jonas Brothers or Selena Gomez. Only recently did we seem to get more in the way of answers. Following an interview with Demi, Noisey pointed out that the track contains a reference to cigar smoking, a habit notably loved by Nick.  Demi also shared in her interview with Noisey that the track was inspired by frustration with a certain situation.  ""And I was like, 'You know what, I'm just going to write about it.' And so I did, and sent [the songs] to that person, and that was... interesting,"" she continued. ""Any time you send a song about the person, to the person, it's ballsy. It's like, 'Hey! Here's my feelings for you!' … They knew [about my feelings], but neither of us had acknowledged [them] before. And then it turned out that person had written a song about me, and we exchanged songs.”  Fans may never know the true meaning behind the song, but with Demi’s upcoming YouTube documentary* Demi Lovato: Simply Complicated* set to debut on October 17, maybe we’ll get another clue. In the meantime, check out her interview with Ellen:  Related:Demi Lovato Reveals the Devastating Reason She Got Sober  Check this out:"	1

The report, sent to NBC employees on Wednesday morning, did include some caveats.  One woman, who eventually came forward about a sexual encounter with Mr. Lauer, said she told a manager in 1996 about an interaction where Mr. Lauer “placed his hand on her thigh and made a sexually suggestive comment.” The manager, who was not identified, agreed at the time to reassign the woman so that she would not travel alongside Mr. Lauer.  The report also said that, of four women who filed complaints about Mr. Lauer’s misbehavior, two believed that senior managers at NBC News and the “Today” show were aware of the anchor’s sexual misconduct. “The former leaders with whom we spoke denied any such knowledge, however, and we were unable to otherwise substantiate it,” the report said.  NBC’s investigators said they interviewed 68 individuals for the report, including current management at the news division and current and former members of the “Today” staff. The report indicated that former NBC News executives were contacted, but did not say whether interviews with those executives had taken place.  Following the release of Wednesday’s report, the woman who accused Mr. Brokaw, Linda Vester, wrote an op-ed column in The Post that criticized NBC for relying on its own in-house counsel.  “I want NBC to stop fighting #MeToo within its own walls,” Ms. Vester wrote. “I ask NBCUniversal to retain an outside investigator to look into sexual harassment and any coverup of sexual harassment at NBC News.”  An advocacy group that grew out of the #MeToo movement, Press Forward, also issued a statement describing the nature of NBC’s review as “an inherent conflict of interest.” The group, which is focused on improving workplace environments for women in the media industry, added, “No one is going to be fully candid when speaking to management for fear of losing their jobs.”  If there was criticism to be found in the NBC report, it came in an assessment of NBC News’s human resources operation. The investigators found it “troubling” that no formal complaints had been filed about Mr. Lauer despite his engaging in sexual relationships with subordinates. The report found that network staff members were fearful of retaliation and did not feel confident that their complaints would be kept confidential, in part because human resources managers occupied glass-walled offices in full view of other NBC News employees.	1

"[This article contains spoilers from the April 16 series finale of HBO's Girls.]  So here's how I'm looking at the series finale of Girls and you may choose to disagree or view things however you like:  Last week's episode, fittingly titled ""Goodbye Tour,"" was the true series finale of Girls. Written by Jenni Konner and Lena Dunham and directed beautifully by Nisha Ganatra, it brought the friendship between Hannah (Dunham), Marnie (Allison Williams), Shosh (Zosia Mamet) and Jessa (Jemima Kirke) to a lovely resting spot at Shosh's engagement party. Hannah looking at her friends dancing each in their own distinctive ways — Jessa like nobody was watching, Marnie like everybody was watching and Shosh fixated on a groom-to-be introduced to audiences and Hannah just seconds earlier — before departing New York City for a job that every think piece posted on the Internet in the past seven days has already told you doesn't exist in our current academic climate and wouldn't have gone to Hannah anyway, was a perfect end for the series.  The previous couple of episodes had also given many of the show's characters their own effective places of repose. With Shosh as accidental matchmaker, Ray (Alex Karpovsky) found love, somebody whose idiosyncrasies matched his own. Elijah (Andrew Rannells) somehow got the lead in the musical of White Men Can't Jump and maybe he and Dill Harcourt are together. And I guess Adam ends up with Jessa, at least for a while, and even if you think that mercurial relationship isn't good for the long haul, Adam Driver's scenes with Dunham/Hannah in the antepenultimate episode were as well-acted as any in the show's entire run. (I'm glad this season has helped a lot of detractors recognize how good an actress Lena Dunham has become over the six seasons of Girls. This isn't a Jerry Seinfeld situation. I don't care if you like or hate Hannah, but Dunham slayed all 10 episodes.)  If you wanted to sum up the series with Hannah's half-apology to Jessa, ""Think about it. We were all just doing our best,"" and Jessa's reply, ""Our best was awful,"" that's a pretty amusing way to do it. Or you can sum the show up in Elijah's braying laughter between sentences of the declaration, ""Hannah, you've made so many wonderful friendships here. That's not a thing!""  All season long, Girls has been sending itself off in the peak of style, delivering one top-notch episode after another. I'm not ready yet to step back and say this was the show's best season or that any individual episode was the show's best episode, but in the balance, from Hannah and Paul-Louis in the Hamptons to the Desi nightmare in Poughkeepsie to the Elijah-centric musical audition episode to Hannah's and Adam's brief dream reconciliation to the brief and triumphant return of Patrick Wilson's doctor character, the highlights have been myriad. And that's without getting to ""American Bitch,"" the two-hander with Matthew Rhys that probably would get the most Best Episode Yet votes.  Let's take the nine episodes as a build-up to last week's finale and then we don't need to stress about what our expectations were or weren't for the last installment.  Because let's be honest: There wasn't anything that Girls owed me (or you) in Sunday's finale. Most of the characters got the send-offs they deserved. There were absolutely no mysteries to be solved or outstanding questions that needed answering or anything that so many Peak TV finales have needed to accomplish when they neared the end. There was no question as to whether Hannah was going to die, whether the CIA was ever going to catch Shosh or whether Adam was going to get that out-of-the-blue phone call from Ron Howard launching his acting career into the stratosphere. Anything you really wanted or deserved from a finale came last week when the four main characters crammed themselves into a bathroom and argued about why they haven't been good friends to each other for a while.  Sunday's episode, ""Latching,"" was an epilogue. It "	1
media_play  Clive James ‘helped us laugh at and love ourselves’  Author and journalist Trent Dalton has praised Australian writer, critic and broadcaster Clive James for the “profound way” he wrote about Australia, saying he “helped us laugh at ourselves and he helped us love ourselves”. “If you read Clive James in the 80s and 90s and became a writer, we have him to thank for if we made it because he’s the guy who showed us it’s not just about words, it’s about sentences and building those sentences into paragraphs and taking your writing to the next level and loving your country,” Mr Dalton told Sky News. “You can still take the mickey out of it but you can love it deeply and that’s what I tried to do in 'Boy Swallows Universe'.” Mr Dalton, who wrote a profile of Mr James in 2015 for the Weekend Australian, said the writer “didn’t waste a second” of his life after being diagnosed with emphysema and leukaemia. “His output at that time - it’s that whole wonderful thing of being inspired,” he said. “Time’s not on your side so just write like the wind, and he really did and I’m so glad that he got eight more books out to the world in the worst time of his life.”	0
"There's one thing Hollywood couple Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt liked to collect during their now-defunct decade long relationship. And no, it wasn't children.  It was houses. They currently own one for each child (six), with a spare for guests or their shoes or whatever you need a seventh home for.  The couple brought significant assets to the union and have only added more, including a charity which was responsible for helping rebuild in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina, giving them a combined net worth of about US$400 million (NZ$547m).  Stuart C Wilson/Getty Images Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt in happier times.  So now that their love is kaput, who gets which palatial abode? Who'll take over the foundation? And more importantly, who gets their ridiculous English Bulldog and renowned Johnny Depp leg-humper, Jacques?

Brad lived there with Jennifer Aniston during their marriage - but will he give it up for Angelina Jolie and the kids?  The Jolie-Pitts have seven houses in various spots around the world, but the family home is a sprawling Craftsman style home in Los Feliz, Los Angeles, that Brad Pitt had previously lived in with jilted ex-wife, Jennifer Aniston.  While his prior ownership of the home might suggest Pitt will keep the home in this divorce too, it's been extensively remodelled for the kids and now includes a huge swimming pool, park land, and an area for dirtbike-riding – something his son Maddox enjoys.  Maybe Angie will want to keep things as normal as possible for her brood in the Los Feliz house, or perhaps she'll want to ship them out to France – her ancestral and spiritual home – where the couple owns the frankly enormous Chateau Miraval.  PHILIPPE LAURENSON/REUTERS An aerial view of the 17th-century Chateau Miraval, the US$60m estate which is owned by actors Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie.  Costing about US$60m and boasting a 30-acre vineyard (famous for a rose called ""Pink Floyd"") and 35 bedrooms (just how many kids did these guys want?), Pitt and Jolie were married in the chateau's chapel in August, 2014.  So, maybe it won't be high on Jolie's list of places to lie low until the news cycle has rolled over them. Perhaps the beach then if it's privacy the divorcees are after?  That's doable, since the pair have what passes for a bach in Hollywood up the coast in Santa Barbara. It comes with 11 acres of land around it and a private beach in front of it, for max seclusion.  PHILIPPE LAURENSON/REUTERS An aerial view of the 17th-century Chateau Miraval.  Pitt bought it in 2000 for US$4m, in recent years the family has used it mainly as a holiday home. But maybe he'll head up there to lick his wounds?  Pitt's also the reluctant owner of a villa in New Orleans that he's been trying to offload since 2015.  The pair bought the five-bed-five-bath home to live in while Pitt was in Nola filming The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. It's on the market now for the bargain basement price of US$5.5m.

Simila­r to any other woman, she has been throug­h a fair share of good and bad days  Hollywood starlet Angelina Jolie can easily be counted as one of the most beautiful women in the world. Similar to any other woman, she has been through a fair share of good and bad days too. However, nothing has ever shown on her face. And boy, we are impressed! Compiled from InStyle, we dig out her changing looks through the years.  1986  With her full lips and bright blue eyes, the 11-year-old daughter of Jon Voight and Marcheline Bertrand was clearly destined to be a spectacular beauty.  1991  As a student at Beverly Hills High School, Jolie was an unknown quantity. “I wore black boots with big silver bat [charms] that dragged when I walked,” Jolie said earlier. “I wasn’t aware of how I looked, but apparently I looked really creepy.”  1998  The pixie-cropped actor won her first Golden Globe for TV biopic George Wallace. The following year she would receive a second statuette for her role in Gia.  1999  She went platinum for Girl, Interrupted, but limited her beauty routine to Carmex and lotion.  2003  The Beyond Borders star, and new mother to adopted son Maddox, lightened up both her locks and makeup for a fresh look.  2007  “Her mouth is so large and beautiful,” makeup artist Janeen Schreyer has said of the born beauty. “I usually don’t colour it.” Hairstylist Ted Gibson shows similar restraint. “She loves to keep a natural wave in her hair. It’s more sensual,” he said.  Jennifer Aniston and Brad Pitt might be getting back together  2008  Pregnant with twins Knox and Vivienne, the actress glowed in a high-volume style at the Kung Fu Panda premiere.  2013  Jolie attended the world premiere of then fiancé Brad Pitt’s movie World War Z just weeks after she revealed she underwent a preventative double mastectomy. She wowed the crowd in a black, floor-length Saint Laurent gown with her caramel locks in a casual curl.  2016  Jolie wore her hair smooth and straight and opted for a pared down beauty look for the Kung Fu Panda 3 Hollywood premiere at the TCL Chinese Theatre.  2017  She was back to retro curls and her classic red lip in 2017.  2018    Only blossoming with age, the red pout seems to have become a regular in Jolie’s makeup routine. The 42-year-old is definitely both beauty and brains.  Have something to add to the story? Share it in the comments below.  Read full story	1
"Get ready to meet the ""queens of the hip-hop scene!""  The girlfriends, wives and fiancées of the biggest names in rap have come together for The Platinum Life, a new reality series on E! that will showcase their lives in the spotlight.  A few of the ladies recently invited ET to experience the ""VIP lifestyle"" with them at the Anaheim Convention Center in Anaheim, California, where Nelly, who is dating one of the gals, was performing. From their favorite perks to the crazy drama, Shantel Jackson, Asiah Collins and Alycia Bella tease what fans can expect from their all-new show.  MORE: Nelly Talks Tour Life, Keeping Music 'Fresh' & What Makes His Girlfriend Stand Out From the Rest (Exclusive)  Shantel Jackson  E!  She's sweet, confident and an all-around awesome support system for her boyfriend, Nelly, whom she's been dating for three and a half years. While chatting with ET, Shantel recalled the exact moment she and Nelly met, and the qualities she loves about him.  ""Nelly and I actually met through a mutual friend of ours and I was so honestly hell-bent on, 'No, I don't think I want to get into another relationship right now or date another celebrity,'"" said Shantel, who previously dated Floyd Mayweather. ""He kept pressing our mutual friend like, 'Just tell her to come chill with me at the studio, I just want to meet her.' I ended up just giving in one day, and honestly, we've been inseparable ever since.""  ""I'm always proud of him,"" she continued. ""I love the way he treats his family, he takes care of his mother, he takes care of his father. Family is really important to him and it's really important to me as well. We're also both adventurous, outdoorsy. He makes me laugh, which is really important. We can be around each other non-stop and not be at each other’s throats like, 'Oh my gosh, I gotta get away from you.' I really enjoy that… I enjoy his company.""  When she's not by Nelly's side, Shantel loves hanging out with her girlfriends and working on her own business ventures. She tells ET that the show will be a mix of all the glitz and glamour, the partying, the drama and an inside look at what goes on behind the scenes.  ""All of that is our lives,"" she explained. ""We do party, we do get to see the concerts that we want to see, we get to watch our men perform. Of course, we are around these other women in the circle and all of us are not going to agree on everything -- [it's natural] to bump heads with someone along the lines and that’s real life.""  ""But even if we're in disagreements one day, I think we still find common ground,"" she added. ""We respect each other enough to not have to throw drinks or throw hands. Keep it cute, classy and catty.""  Asiah Collins  E!  Kid Ink's wife has been with the rapper since they were just ""young, broke kids"" in high school -- their first date was a trip to the movies followed by $3 sushi! -- but after all this time together, there's nothing Asiah loves more than being his ""Main Chick.""  ""I feel like the only girl in the world, to be honest,"" she gushed. ""He's very good at making me feel like I'm the only chick that matters.""  And while she doesn't mind being known as Ink's wife, Asiah's excited for fans to see a different side of her on the show, which premieres on the couple's one-year wedding anniversary. In addition to supporting her husband, Asiah keeps busy by raising their 1-year-old daughter, Aislin, and working on her own dreams.  ""Oh my God, I'm still trying to figure that out,"" Asiah said, when asked how she balances it all in this industry. ""Sometimes it gets really tricky, but most of the time it's just about having a really good support system.""  ""But I'm excited for fans to learn that I do have a brain and a personality and I'm out here making moves,"" she added. ""Also, just more about the roles that I play on tour, helping Ink out. I'm not only there to be a pretty face -- I'm actually contributing to the tour, handling the merch, etc. Anything he needs me to do, I'll do "	1

"Netflix calls out 53 'Christmas Prince' viewers and Twitter claps back  Social media clapped back at Netflix Sunday after the online movie streaming company called out 53 people who can't stop watching a sappy Christmas comedy.  On Sunday evening, Netflix tweeted: ""To the 53 people who've watched A Christmas Prince every day for the past 18 days: Who hurt you?""  If you haven't heard of A Christmas Prince, the romantic comedy is about a reporter who tries to get the inside scoop on a playboy prince while pretending to be a tutor.  While it's common knowledge that while you're watching Netflix, the online streaming company is also watching you, the creepy tweet and didn't sit well with the Twittersphere.  @Johnson_DavidW pointed out that Netflix collects data on paying users, and the tweet ""demonstrates that they'll use that data to ridicule specific customers publicly.""  Lifetime, a go-to for sappy Christmas movies, tweeted that they were happy to welcome the Christmas Prince viewers with open arms."	1
"Jennifer Lawrence is going to want Christina Aguilera's party favor!  The pop star turned 37 on Monday and celebrated by having a party that included a homemade Twister mat with the faces of Bravo stars. In the photo shared on Aguilera's Instagram story of the game, The Real Housewives of New York City cast members Luann de Lesseps and Bethenny Frankel are featured.  Instagram  The former Voice coach also shared a pic of her birthday cake, which read: ""Happy birthday, Xtina. We love you!""  Instagram  As for her birthday outfit, Aguilera wore three different shades of pink, including a slip dress, jacket and heels. ""Feeling pretty in b-day pink💞 Thankful for the love and joy my besties fill me with all year round!"" she captioned the pic of her ensemble.  Aguilera's color choice comes after Pink hinted that she and the ""Dirrty"" singer might be collaborating on a song together, proving once again that the two have made amends since their ""Lady Marmalade"" days.  ""Her and I have had history and it hasn't always been wonderful,"" Pink admitted to ET, noting that the two are no longer frenemies. ""I think it just took us 15 years and I feel like there was true love and it felt really good.""

"Image copyright INEZ AND VINOODH/VOGUE Image caption Zayn Malik and Gigi Hadid in the US Vogue photoshoot  US Vogue has apologised for ""missing the mark"" by saying Zayn Malik and his girlfriend Gigi Hadid were ""embracing gender fluidity"".  In an interview, the former One Directioner and the US model talked about borrowing each other's clothes.  They were photographed in colourful, fairly androgynous clothes.  But readers mocked the magazine for its definition of the phrase, pointing out that what you wear does not make you ""gender fluid"".  Many on social media pointed out that the term refers to people with a particular transgender identity, who do not conform to societal expectations of male or female or identify as either.  For instance Jacob Tobia wrote in Cosmopolitan: ""If you're going to talk about a marginalised community, talk to that community.  ""Unlike how this new Vogue cover shoot presents it, the lived experience of being gender-nonconforming is rarely that fun and glamorous.""  'It's about shapes'  Vogue describes a conversation between the pair, with Hadid telling Malik: ""I shop in your closet all the time, don't I?"".  The 24-year-old singer then replies that he borrowed an Anna Sui T-shirt from her, adding: ""I like that shirt. And if it's tight on me, so what? It doesn't matter if it was made for a girl.""  Hadid, 22, agrees, saying: ""Totally. It's not about gender. It's about, like, shapes. And what feels good on you that day.  ""And anyway, it's fun to experiment.""  Image copyright INEZ AND VINOODH/VOGUE  Vogue writer Maya Singer comments in the piece, in US Vogue's August issue, that for many young people ""gender is a more or less arbitrary distraction"" and that there is ""a terrific opportunity for play"".  She says ""this new blase attitude toward gender codes marks a radical break"", adding: ""For these millennials, at least, descriptives like boy or girl rank pretty low on the list of important qualities - and the way they dress reflects that.""  'Such a big jump'  But poet Tyler Ford, who's quoted in the accompanying article exploring gender norms, tweeted (with an eyeroll emoji): ""The only mention of the word 'trans' is by me via interview.""  Journalist and author Hannah Orenstein said she would have preferred Tyler to have been profiled instead of Hadid and Malik, tweeting: ""Zayn and Gigi are profiled in this piece on gender fluidity because... they borrow each other's clothes sometimes?""  Another reader noted on Twitter: ""Y'all notice Zayn isn't out here wearing dresses.""  And Colette Fahy wrote: ""All Z & G say is that they borrow each other's clothes. Such a big jump for the mag to declare gender fluidity.""  In a statement issued on Friday, a Vogue spokeswoman said: ""The story was intended to highlight the impact the gender-fluid, non-binary communities have had on fashion and culture.  ""We are very sorry the story did not correctly reflect that spirit - we missed the mark.  ""We do look forward to continuing the conversation with greater sensitivity.""

    So sweet! Justin Timberlake took to Instagram on Monday, July 31, to praise his wife, Jessica Biel, for her performance on her new TV series, The Sinner.  “OK, I know I’m not exactly fair and maybe biased here, but my wife’s new show – @thesinnerusa – is amazing,” the 10-time Grammy winner, 36, captioned a trailer for the eight-episode USA Network crime drama. “It’s like nothing I’ve seen her in before, and she’s incredible in the role. You should check it out when it premieres Wednesday on USA. –JT.”  The actress, 35, plays Cora, a young mother living in upstate New York who commits a brutal act of violence against a stranger. The series, which many critics are calling a “whydunit” rather than a “whodunit,” follows Cora and her inner struggles as viewers attempt to decipher whether her crime was motivated. “I just did it. And I don’t know why,” a blood-soaked Cora says in one teaser.  Biel opened up about The Sinner, which is based on Petra Hammesfahr‘s 2008 novel of the same name, during a recent appearance on the Today show. “We are not looking for who, we are looking for why,” she said of the plot. “Why did this seemingly normal young woman who has a family and a child and husband, why did she do this horrific act? … We all as human beings have the possibility to snap and we don’t do it. But what makes us cross the line?”  The 7th Heaven alum also revealed how she’d react if her and Timberlake’s 2-year-old son, Silas, decides to become an actor one day. “It’s hard to say no because I was given so many opportunities and my family was so supportive of everything, even when I was so young. But it’s hard to say yes because it’s such an intense experience,” she said on Today. “It’s a tough business. It’s a ruthless business. I would be hesitant if he was so young.”  The Sinner premieres on USA on Wednesday, August 2, at 10 p.m. ET.	1

www.ibtimes.com / Tuesday, 16 May 2017 08:27:20  Stephanie Shepherd, the assistant to “Keeping Up With the Kardashians” star Kim Kardashian West, was often the silent sidekick. She attended some of Kardashian’s most intimate moments, like when North West was born and when Kardashian married rapper Kanye West. She was also there when Kardashian was robbed at gunpoint in Paris during an October heist. Along the way, Shepherd remained silent —until now.	1
Special occasion: Of his meeting with Prince Charles, who gave him the accolade, Ed said that he impressed was impressed that Ed was due to fly to New York that evening  British musician Ed Sheeran has risked breaching royal protocol after he touched Prince Charles's arm after receiving an MBE.  Six years after breaking into the music industry, double Grammy winner Ed was given the prestigious honour at Buckingham Palace, London today.  Musician Ed, from Suffolk, collected the MBE from Prince Charles, simultaneously hinting that he would like to perform at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's 2018 royal wedding.  But the star violated ancient rules governing commoners and royalty by laying his hand on the Prince of Wales' forearm while the heir to the throne shook his hand.  Touching the special family is highly regulated, with the only contact expected to be initiated by the royal and never vice versa.  But Ed is not the first person to fall foul of the protocol - LeBron James and Michelle Obama are among those to have goofed up in this area.  And it isn't Ed's first experience of a faux pas involving royalty - he reportedly had his face sliced by Princess Beatrice at a party last November as she mock-knighted James Blunt with a sword.  Scroll down for video  When asked if he'd like to sing for Charles' son and the former Suits actress at their ceremony at Windsor Chapel next May - he said: 'Yeah, why not.'  Ed remained modest about his achievements saying he didn't have 'vast talent' compared to other artists but his 'persistence, drive and self belief' had paid off.  An honour: Ed Sheeran received an MBE at Buckingham Palace in London on Thursday, for his contribution to music  Speaking at the palace, Ed explained: 'I think it's persistence. I don't have a vast amount of talent compared to other people.  'I think talent is like 30% of it and persistence, drive and self belief are the other ones, which I guess are all the same thing.'  Special moment: The hitmaker looked sharp in a morning suit and shiny black shoes  Joking about his meeting with Charles, the musician said the Prince was impressed by his globe-trotting activities as he was due to fly to New York later for a gig.  Sheeran said about their brief chat: 'He was asking me if I was still selling lots of records and I told him I've got a concert in New York tomorrow, and he was quite surprised I was flying after this.'  He added: 'My grandfather was a massive royalist. He had all the commemorative plates and stuff, and he died on this day four years ago, so it's actually quite a nice full circle thing. I guess he'd be pretty proud.'  Putting his hat in the ring: Ed said he would like to perform for Meghan Markle and Prince Harry at their May 2018 wedding  Charming: Prince Harry (right) is the second son of Prince Charles (centre, with first son Prince William, left)  The singer-songwriter's career took off after the release of his debut CD in 2011 and since that time the 26-year-old musician has notched up three number one singles, along with three chart topping albums.  Ed received the MBE (Member of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire) for his services to music.  An MBE is given for an outstanding achievement or service to the community, which has had a long-term, significant impact and stand out as an example to others.  Ed won an Ivor Novello Award for Songwriter of the Year in 2015, having previously penned the hits Love Yourself and Cold Water for Justin Bieber.  Modest: Ed was modest about his achievements, saying he owed his success to persistence  Recognised: Ed has had three chart-topping albums in six years  Delighted: He will fly to New York tonight for a concert in the city  He was the brains behind Little Things, a hit for One Direction, and Olly Murs' Love Shine Down, as well as working with Eminem, The Weeknd and Jessie Ware.  Ed collaborated with his good friend Taylor Swift, with whom he toured for the majority of 2013. They worked together	1
"The Duggar family is setting the record straight on a rumor buzzing around the internet.  Jessa (Duggar) and husband Ben Seewald are not expecting their third child, despite earlier reports. A Duggar family spokesperson told E! News exclusively that Jessa is not pregnant.  Earlier this week, a report from In Touch reported that Jessa was four months along and would be making an announcement in April, according to an anonymous source. It should be noted no one in the Duggar family confirmed that report.  As it turns out, Jessa and Ben are too busy parenting their two kids, Henry, 13 months, and Spurgeon, 2, to think about more kids.  ""Right now we have two kids and there’s two of us, so it’s man-to-man coverage. When we have more, we’ll have to switch it up to a zone defense!” Ben joked to PEOPLE magazine last year, with Jessa adding that they may be expanding their family in non-biological method  ""It will be a little while since we just had a baby, but adopting and fostering to adopt is very much in our hearts,"" Jessa said.  Some fans think they are ""overdue"" for another pregnancy and even insisted that Ben's hand placement on Jessa's stomach in a Duggar family photo signified that baby number three was on the way.  In the photo, Ben is seemingly cradling Jessa's stomach — and paired with a loose-fitting dress, fans are convinced that Jessa is sporting what would be her third baby bump.  ""So when will Jessa be making her announcement too? She totally looks preggers too!"" a fan commented on Facebook.  Meanwhile, Jessa's sister, Jinger (Duggar) Vuolo is expecting her first child with husband Jeremy Vuolo, with Kendra Caldwell and Joe Duggar welcoming their first baby as well. Plus, Joy-Anna (Duggar) and Austin Forsyth already welcomed their first child in February.  In February, Jinger shared an 18-week baby bump update on Instagram, revealing that baby Vuolo is about the size of a bell pepper.  Jinger and husband Jeremy Vuolo first announced they were expecting their first child together in January, revealing soon after their July 2018 due date. The couple was married in November 2016."	1

Sci-fi fans have been waiting with bated breath for “Altered Carbon”. The intriguing new Netflix series that debuts Friday is set in a dystopian future in which technology has created a form of immortality by allowing human consciousness to be transferred from one body to another .  For star Joel Kinnaman, the high-profile series did not come without sacrifices.  “I spent the first two days buck naked in front of 250 people I just met,” Kinnaman explained to E! News. “So, I’ve never done that before.”  RELATED: Joel Kinnaman Says Sexual Misconduct Allegations Against ‘House Of Cards’ Co-Star Kevin Spacey ‘Wasn’t A Shock’  In the scene in question, Kinnaman’s character is “re-sleeved” as his consciousness gets transferred into a new body, which required him to be not just naked, but also covered in a thick, gelatinous goo.  “I don’t know what it was, but it was strange because when they put that goo on, the skin stopped breathing,” said Kinnaman. “So it was hot like a sauna in that room and I was buck naked, but I had that goo all over so I was freezing because the skin didn’t get any oxygen. It was really weird…”  RELATED: Netflix’s Wild New Trailer For ‘Altered Carbon’ Will Blow You Away  “That’s why they didn’t show everything,” joked his co-star James Purefoy. “He was hung like a raisin in that scene.”  “Altered Carbon” debuts Friday, February 2.	1
"Talk about a knockout! Maryse Ouellet had some exciting baby news for Mike ""The Miz"" Mizanin on Wednesday's episode of Total Divas, and the WWE star's reaction is priceless.  ""Mike has been on the road. I haven't seen him in a few days and I'm feeling tired,"" Maryse says in a confessional. ""I feel like I need to nap all the time and it's just not like me.

After the real estate crash in 2008, they began flipping homes in the Orange County area.  In 2011, Tarek asked a friend to help him make an audition tape for HGTV filming an entire episode of the process of house flipping from start to finish.

She handles the designs of the new spaces and keeps everything on schedule. The show follows them as they buy homes, typically bank-owned, short sales or foreclosures, to renovate and resell.[5]  Hosts [ edit ]  Personal life [ edit ]  Tarek El Moussa and Christina Anstead met while working in the real estate industry. The couple married in 2009 and they have two children, a girl named Taylor Reese and a boy named Brayden James.[6] When the housing market plummeted after the October 2008 stock market crash they went from living in a $6,000 per month home to a $700 per month apartment, inspiring them to focus on flipping houses.[7]  In 2013, a registered nurse and viewer, Ryan Reade, contacted the network after seeing a lump on Tarek's neck during a Flip or Flop marathon. After Reade contacted producers, Tarek was diagnosed with testicular cancer [8]and thyroid cancer.[9] The El Moussas thanked Reade in a video that can be seen on HGTV.com.[10] Tarek has been in remission for six years.  In May 2016, the couple separated after an incident at their Southern California home. According to a Yorba Linda, CA police report, Christina called the police after Tarek fled their home with a gun, believing he was suicidal.[11] Tarek was found by the police, and maintained that he was never suicidal and had simply gone for a hike, taking a gun to protect himself from wild animals.[12] In January 2017, Tarek officially filed for divorce from Christina.[13]  Real estate career [ edit ]  Tarek and Christina ran a real-estate agency, The El Moussa Group, in Orange County, California, an area with one of the largest foreclosure rates in the country. Tarek, Christina, and their partner Pete De Best, bought their first investment house in Santa Ana for $115,000. After selling the property for a profit of $34,000, the trio split the money and continued to flip houses, expanding their real estate investing business into Arizona and Nevada.[14] Following their divorce, The El Moussa Group was dissolved and is now run under the name Tarek and Associates.[15]  In 2018 Tarek and Christina co-founded a real estate education course called Real Estate Elevated.[16]  Series overview [ edit ]  Season Episodes Originally aired First aired Last aired 1 13 April 16, 2013 ( ) May 28, 2013 ( 2013-05-28 ) 2 14 April 8, 2014 ( ) July 8, 2014 ( 2014-07-08 ) 3 15 October 7, 2014 ( ) July 7, 2015 ( 2015-07-07 ) 4 15 December 3, 2015 ( ) March 24, 2016 ( 2016-03-24 ) 5 15 June 9, 2016 ( ) September 22, 2016 ( 2016-09-22 ) 6 15 December 1, 2016 ( ) March 30, 2017 ( 2017-03-30 ) 7 20 June 15, 2017 ( ) September 6, 2018 ( 2018-09-06 )  References [ edit ]    	0

"A new story about Blake Shelton shopping for a $500K ""diamond ring"" for Gwen Stefani and proposing on Valentine's Day is made-up. The claim comes from the HollywoodLife, a site that has previously published fake news stories alleging they're already engaged, were getting engaged on Christmas, had a ""secret wedding,"" were eloping, and may ""never get married"" at all. The blog has also falsely reported a couple of times that Shelton and Stefani have split up.  @gwenstefani / Instagram  Basically, the outlet throws everything against the wall, hoping something will stick. And wedged inside its Jenga-like tower of lies, the site contends it's learned its supposed information from sources ""close"" to the couple. But based on how frequently off-base the blog is, it's clear many of these articles are just fabrications.  On the heels of Shelton, Stefani and her kids looking like a happy family at the Super Bowl, the aptly nicknamed HollywoodLies maintains Shelton is taking their ""relationship to the next step."" The often discredited site asserts a ""source close"" to Shelton leaked that his ""team"" has gone to ""shop for jewelry"" for him. A so-called ""insider"" is quoted as saying, ""One of Blake's assistants was spotted visiting and shopping with a private jeweler in Beverly Hills this week."" The questionable source adds that the diamond ring would be for a ""Valentine's Day proposal.""  Naturally, the habitually wrong outlet doesn't mention when Shelton's ""assistant"" supposedly went engagement ring shopping. And suspiciously, the blog doesn't seem to have the name of the (probably nonexistent) jeweler. It also bears noting that HollywoodLies would like its readers believe that for such an important and meaningful present, like an engagement ring, Shelton simply sent out an ""assistant"" and told him or her to pick out something nice for Stefani.  Irrespective of how the article is missing key information and defies logic, Gossip Cop still fact-checked the repeatedly disproven site's story. Literally, no real insiders could confirm that Shelton sent an assistant off on an engagement ring run for Stefani. Additionally, we were told long ago that despite the blog's assertions, no one ""close"" to the singer is sharing personal details or inaccurate gossip about Shelton with HollywoodLies, including tales about him shopping for an engagement ring.  And it should be clear from that site's own reporting that it does not have true insiders, as it has falsely maintained. Remember, this is the same outlet that Gossip Cop busted when it untruthfully claimed in the past that Shelton and Stefani were engaged. We also exposed the blog when it lied about Shelton proposing to Stefani on Christmas. It appears HollywoodLies is just going to run its proposal story tied to a number of holidays, events, and milestones, hoping one day they're right. And maybe they'll finally guess correctly, but it will have nothing to do with solid reporting or sources.

Following her appearance at the event, held in New York City's Madison Square Gardens, the search term ""Lady Gaga face lift"" started trending on Google.  Taking to Twitter, viewers accused Gaga — real name Stefani Germanotta — of having had appearance-altering procedures.  (Image: Getty)  (Image: Getty)  (Image: Getty)  One fan said of the 31-year-old: ""Oh no. She's started the plastic surgery crisis phase.""  Another wrote: ""Why did she get plastic surgery herself? Her face at the Grammys looks nothing like her face in 2009.""  In agreement, a viewer remarked: ""That doesn't even look like Gaga. What has she done to her face?""  Taking things a step further, one Twitter user made reference to the singer's empowering 2011 song which encouraged people to be comfortable in their own skin.  They wrote: ""Gaga? What happened to 'You were Born this Way'? Love your face as normal.  (Image: Getty) (Image: Getty)  ""Stop lift [sic] and Botox your face. You're very pretty without this bulls***.""  In search of an expert opinion, Daily Star Online contacted plastic surgeon Dr Maurino Joffily of Harley Street, London.  After studying pictures of Gaga — dating from 2007 to the present day — the medical practitioner revealed what appearance-altering procedures he believes the singer has had done.  Talking exclusively to us, Dr Joffily revealed he spotted indications the award-winning performer has had a nose job.  He said: ""The nose looks straighter and narrower, and the tip more defined.""  (Image: Getty) (Image: Getty)  However, the London-based surgeon also suggested another explanation for the change in appearance of Gaga's nose.  The medical professional explained: ""Even though her nose looks different, it might be a result of some fillers and Botox combined.""  Commenting on the starlet's face, he added: ""I suspect [use of] Botox as in many pictures her brows look higher.  ""She might also have had fillers in her chin and cheeks.""  In a 2013 interview with Sirius XM radio host Howard Stern, 64, Gaga denied having had any work done, but admitted to using facial injections.  (Image: Getty)  Getting candid on the New York-based show, she said: ""I've never had any 'work work' done, but I went through a phase when I was smoking pot when I was really obsessed with getting facial injections...  ""Before I shot the Applause video, [a photographer friend] was like, 'Gaga, I love you but if you don't stop injecting s*** in your face, I'm going to just kill you.'""  After studying recent pictures of the US musician, Dr Joffily noted further signs of appearance-altering procedures.  He told us: ""Her lips are more prominent and fuller, indicating some fillers there as well.""  Daily Star Online has contacted Lady Gaga's representative for comment."	0
"This article is about the singer. For her eponymous debut album, see Christina Aguilera (album)  American singer, songwriter, actress, and television personality  Christina María Aguilera ( , Spanish: [aɣiˈleɾa];[1] born December 18, 1980) is an American singer, songwriter, actress and television personality. Her accolades include five Grammy Awards, one Latin Grammy Award, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Aguilera ranked at number 58 on Rolling Stone's list of 100 Greatest Singers of All Time in 2008, and was included on Time's annual list of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2013. With estimated sales of 75 million records, she is one of the world's best-selling music artists.  Born in Staten Island of New York City and raised in Pennsylvania, Aguilera appeared on television shows in her early years before gaining a recording contract with RCA Records in 1998. Her self-titled debut album, released in 1999, reached number one in the US and spawned three US number-one singles: ""Genie in a Bottle"", ""What a Girl Wants"", and ""Come On Over Baby (All I Want Is You)"". While recognized as a prominent figure in the contemporary teen pop scene, Aguilera sought to assume artistic control with Stripped (2002) and its lead single ""Dirrty"", which displayed her sexually emancipated persona and generated considerable controversy. The second single from the album, ""Beautiful"", received favorable response for its empowering lyrics and became an anthem for the LGBT community.  Aguilera scored her second US number-one album with Back to Basics (2006), which drew inspiration from early 20th-century jazz, soul, and blues, and spawned the top-ten singles ""Ain't No Other Man"", ""Hurt"", and ""Candyman"". Her next three albums, Bionic (2010), Lotus (2012), and Liberation (2018), all experimented with various musical styles and reached the top ten in the US. Besides solo materials, Aguilera earned chart-topping entries with collaborations including ""Lady Marmalade"", ""Moves like Jagger"", ""Feel This Moment"", and ""Say Something"". Alongside her music career, Aguilera starred in the film Burlesque (2010) and was a coach on six seasons of the singing competition television series The Voice from 2011 to 2016.  Life and career  1980–1998: Early life and career beginnings  Christina María Aguilera was born in Staten Island, New York City, on December 18, 1980, to musician Shelly Loraine Kearns (née Fidler) and United States Army soldier Fausto Xavier Aguilera.[2] Her father is Ecuadorian[clarify], and her mother has German, Irish, Welsh, and Dutch ancestry.[4] Her family moved frequently because of her father's military service, and lived in places including New Jersey, Texas, New York, and Japan.[5] Aguilera alleged that her father was physically and emotionally abusive.[6] To cope with her turbulent household, she used music as a form of escape.[7] Following her parents' divorce when she was six years old, Aguilera, her younger sister Rachel, and her mother moved into her grandmother's home in Rochester, a suburb in the Pittsburgh area.[4] Her mother later remarried and had one more child.[8] After years of estrangement, Aguilera expressed interest in reconciling with her father in 2012.[9]  As a child, Aguilera was drawn to soul and blues records her grandmother bought and would practice singing, which earned her a reputation as ""the little girl with the big voice"" in her neighborhood.[10] She aspired to be a singer, and won her first talent show at age eight with a rendition of Whitney Houston's ""I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)"".[5] Aged 10, she performed ""A Sunday Kind of Love"" on the competition show Star Search, and was eliminated during the semi-final round.[7] She performed the song again on KDKA-TV's Wake Up with Larry Richert.

In 2017, dating rumors began to swirl around Céline Dion and her backup dancer Pepe Muñoz. This was just one year after husband René Angélil passed away from a heart attack. Here’s what we know about their relationship and Dion’s alleged boyfriend.  Her reps originally denied the reports, insisting that the two are just friends. About a year ago, the two were spotted together in Paris, where Muñoz accompanied her to the Giambattista Valli fashion show.  GET CELINE DION CONCERT TICKETS!  Muñoz told Vogue about working with and getting to know Dion.  “She’s the kind of person [for whom] the day has no schedule, no time, no nothing, so whenever she feels the creativity coming, that’s what happens,” he said. “She makes you feel welcome, like you belong to the family, and like you’re part of the group. She’s absolutely fearless with her style, her dancing, her performing, and as a person in her clothes.”  However, in April 2017, Dion told The Sun she wasn’t ready to enter the dating world again.  “Now it is definitely too soon for me… I am definitely in love with [René], married to him,” she said.  GET CELINE DION CONCERT TICKETS!  In January of this year, the 34-year-old said he and Dion found the rumors to be funny.  “These rumors really amused us,” he told Gala. “And we still laugh about them.”  Muñoz added, “I can count on her when I need to talk, and I am ready to listen to her, too.”  During a January 2017 concert, the two shared a sensual number on-stage, fueling the dating rumors.  The dancer is from Malaga, Spain, and is also an illustrator. He attended the Royal Academy of Dancing and even performed in the Cirque du Soleil show Zumanity.  He was first asked to dance for Dion by her personal assistant and eagerly jumped at the opportunity.  “I’d always been a great fan, not like a psycho fan, but I’ve always loved her music,” Muñoz said. “I said ‘yes,’ of course, then rapidly went to the gym to start doing sit-ups.”  Nonetheless, their insistence on being just friends has quelled the rumors since.	0

"Jennifer Lawrence: Bad reviews of mother! hurt my relationship with Darren Aronofsky  Jennifer Lawrence hinted that bad reviews of mother! (2017) played a role in the downfall of her relationship with the film's director, Darren Aronofsky.  The confession was revealed in a one-on-one interview with Adam Sandler, as part of Variety's Actors on Actors series.  ""Normally, I promote a movie, you put the work in to promoting it, ask people to go see it, and then it's just kind of out of your hands. I normally just kind of let it go,"" she said. ""Dating the director is different.""  She continued, ""We'd be on the tour together. I'd come back to the hotel, and the last thing I want to talk about or think about is a movie. He comes back from the tour, and that's all he wants to talk about and I get it. It's his baby. He wrote it. He conceived it. He directed it. I was doing double duty trying to be a supportive partner while also being like, 'Can I please, for the love of God, not think about mother! for one second?'""  Eventually, she said, the dynamic became unhealthy. ""I finally was just like, 'It's not healthy. Neither of us are doing it because if I read it, I start getting defensive.'

Lawrence and Aronofsky's split was first reported by Entertainment Tonight in November. They were reported to have broken up in October and the split was said to have been amicable. They were together for about a year.  Released in September, mother! quickly became one of the most controversial movies of the year, earning a rare ""F"" from CinemaScore."	1

Jason Beghe filed for divorce from his wife of 17 years on Thursday, citing 'irreconcilable differences,' according to The Blast.  The 57-year-old Chicago PD star married actress Angie Janu in 2000 and the pair share two children, 14-year-old Bix and 11-year-old Bo.  Beghe notes in his filing that he will pay spousal support to his estranged partner, but wishes to keep some assets he inherited out of the divorce proceedings.  Jason Beghe filed for divorce from his wife of 17 years on Thursday, citing 'irreconcilable differences,'  The Californication actor had recently been 'investigated' by NBC for his behavior on the set of Chicago PD 'that some [cast and crew] said constituted sexual harassment', according to Deadline.  According to The Blast, the Thelma And Louise actor 'will pay up spousal support, but does list a few inherited properties he wants to keep separate in the divorce.'  He is also applying for joint legal and physical custody of their children.  The veteran actor 'has apparently consistently used highly aggressive and sexually suggestive language' on the set of his NBC show, as well as 'intimidating' behavior, according to Deadline.  Happier times: Beghe and wife Angie Janu are pictured here in 1997  Beghe was investigated by NBC last year over claims he bullied his colleagues on the show's cast and crew.  'People felt disrespected, he yelled a tremendous amount, he had a quick fuse and when it was set off, it was unpleasant for everyone around him,' an insider told Variety.  Numerous people affiliated the with program complained about the behavior of Beghe, a New York native, citing a penchant for remarks that offended his peers, the outlet reported.  Mercurial: Chicago P.D. actor Jason Beghe, 57, was investigated by NBC human resources last year amid claims he was a bully toward colleagues on the TV program. Pictured May 2017  According to Deadline, an insider noted that some actors were physically injured amid stunts and conflicts with the actor.  Beghe's misbehavior also factored into actress Sophia Bush's decision to leave the show, a source told Variety.  NBCUniversal human resources was apprised of the situation and documented it in his employee file while furbishing the actor, who plays Hank Voight on the show, with an anger management coach.  'The environment has improved drastically,' insiders told Variety, noting that Beghe has shown 'significant improvement' in his conduct, with no complaints over his behavior over the last six months.  Coming clean: The entertainer admitted he's 'been hurtful to [his] friends and colleagues' in the past  Beghe said in a statement he's 'deeply sorry' for his mercurial behavior, acknowledging he's 'been hurtful to [his] friends and colleagues.'  He continued: 'I have struggled with anger issues for some time, and over the past year, I have been working with a coach to help me learn how to mitigate my temper. It’s an ongoing process, and it has been a humbling one.  'It is a source of great pride for me to be part of Chicago P.D.’s incredible cast and crew. I have personally apologized to anyone who I have upset, and I am committed to doing what is necessary to make up any damage that I may have caused.'  NBC issued a statement with the companies that producing the show, Universal Television and Wolf Entertainment, indicating they 'promptly began an investigation' when they were apprised of the situation, have 'already taken action,' and 'continue to monitor very closely to ensure all of our employees feel safe and supported.'	1

Serena Williams attends the launch of the Burberry DK88 Bag hosted by Christopher Bailey at Burberry Soho on May 2, 2017 in New York City.  Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ve heard that Serena Williams, tennis goddess and one of the best athletes on this here planet Earth, is pregnant. Folks are so ready for any and all news about Williams’ bambino, her impending nuptials to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian and what she’s wearing as the couple traipses across the globe on a superglamorous babymoon.  One of the biggest surprises about Willams’ pregnancy — besides her sister, Venus, accidentally spilling the beans to the press about the baby’s gender (a girl!) — has been her maternity style. Take a peek at her Instagram page, which has 5.8 million followers, and notice the subtle fashion change. Since she announced her pregnancy in April, Williams has been stepping out in classic, elegant attire.  It started with the custom green silk halter maternity dress that she wore to the Met Gala. Williams’ longtime fashion stylist, Kesha McLeod, was responsible for giving us the first taste of the new Serena aesthetic: sexy and dramatic, yet understated and well-executed. Williams’ new “work” clothes have veered toward the conservative side, with hemlines hitting her knee and made in soft fabrics that flatter her incredible, muscled-like-nobody’s-business body. The makeup and hair are elegant and pretty. Williams is the now the very picture of a calm, meditative madonna, a blossoming mama-to-be.  But hold on for a minute. We’re all here for the #blackgirlgoals, but where is our Serena? You know, the 23-time Grand Slam champion who plays tennis in leatherette catsuits, gladiator tennis boots, miles of weave, tons of jewelry, makeup and nails. Not that folk expected a nine-month circus show, but we are talking about a world-class athlete who has spent the past 20 years staring down anyone who came at her wrong for being too flashy, too urban, not feminine enough, too much of her own woman. Surely, the ruthless assassin who killed weaker women on the pro tennis circuit before the breakfast dishes were cleared would dress the same part as a very fit pregnant lady.  And though Williams’ turn at demure appropriateness isn’t at all what we expected from “La Williams of Compton,” we’re actually getting what we need from someone who has titillated us with her style antics. Not that she would have, but Williams could have gone the Kim Kardashian, “Kanye only likes me in stilettos when I’m pregnant” route. Or the way of her also-pregnant BFF, Beyoncé, whose deep dive into belly-baring African Earth Mother goddessdom has temporarily shut Sasha Fierce all the way down.  Seems our Serena is more than ready to make the transition from single, multimillionaire megastar to wife of a Silicon Valley entrepreneur geek and mom of a (very) genetically blessed baby. And the hardcore fashionista who already has a successful clothing line sold on HSN now has a legitimate shot at designing a maternity line for active, fit moms if she wants. Williams would be the perfect model, and you just know she’d knock that ball out of the park. So, serve it up, mama. We’re all here for it.  Serena went casual chic with a simple cotton, polka dot-print dress with hip, but comfy Chanel espadrilles when she announced that she’d joined the board of SurveyMonkey.  Guests who attended Beyoncé’s star-studded baby shower came dressed in African-inspired clothing. Serena’s traditional head wrap was colorful and fun.  A patterned shirt dress and beautiful nude pumps can make any woman look good. Serena knows these things because Serena is the GOAT.  Nothing says summertime at an amusement park like a denim overall shorts set. This particular one happens to be worn by the best pound-for-pound athlete in the world.  The dress that started it all: Serena’s curve-hugging Versace Met Gala gown debuted her baby bump in the best, most fashionable way possible.  Taking a style cue	1

"Taylor Swift and Ed Sheeran get real.  The 27-year-old singer shared a behind-the-scenes clip of her ""End Game"" music video on YouTube and her The Swift Life app on Friday. In the five-minute ""making of"" clip, the two friends discuss their recent collaboration and how Sheeran knew ""exactly what to do"" when she played the track for the first time.  ""I was in a hotel room in New York in bed about 8 o'clock in the morning and I woke up because for some reason I'd dreamed it in my head what I was going to do,"" he explained, with Swift jokingly quipping, ""So it's not talent, it accidentally happened to you.""  Newly-engaged Sheeran also recounted how his relationship began with his fiancé, Cherry Seaborn, whom he invited to one of Swift's Fourth of July parties at her home.  ""There’s a film with Tom Cruise called Born on the Fourth of July. My relationship started on the Fourth of July,"" Sheeran explained.  “At whose house?” asked Swift.  “At Taylor’s house. So the story was, I was at Taylor’s party, and then a girl I went to school with who’s pretty cool ended up being in Rhode Island,"" he continued. ""I was like, ‘Taylor, can she turn up?’ And here we are.”  ""End Game"" made fans instantly think of Swift's previous celebrity feuds with Kim Kardashian, Kanye West and Katy Perry.

"Mandy Moore's serene blue sequin gown from yesterday's Screen Actors Guild Awards is so much more than a pretty dress. Turns out the Ralph Lauren Collection look actually represents a full circle version of the This Is Us star's career resurgence (maybe like Winona Ryder's comeback hair?).  Moore's stylist Erica Cloud explained it all to People, noting that the fashion house recreated the same Ralph Lauren dress Moore wore to LA premier of Saved in 2004 when she was just 20 years old. Moore even tried on the original dress, just to get the perfect fit.  “I think it’s very symbolic of her rebirth,” Cloud said about the whole design process. “It was such a cool look then, we thought, ‘Why not revisit it now?’ It’s a beautiful, elegant silhouette. For her, I think it shows she’s still herself, but just an updated version.""  Here's the original gown. See the resemblance?  Maybe the biggest update is Moore's very 2017 beauty look. She turned to very hip LA sisters and beauty gurus Ashley Streicher and Jenn Streicher for her hair and makeup yesterday.  Mandy's nude pout involved a layer of Laura Mercier Lip Pencil in Chestnut, with Laura Mercier Velour Extreme Matte Lipstick in Vibe applied on top. Her smoky copper eye involved a wash of Laura Mercier Caviar Stick Eye Colour in Copper up to the crease of her eyelid, with Laura Mercier Caviar Stick Eye Colour in Peacock as a pop of blue color in the corner of her eyes. On her nails, she wore Essie's Mademoiselle nail polish.  To get those bouncy curls, Ashley wrapped Moore's blow-dried hair in 1.25-inch velcro rollers and sprayed it with Garnier Fructis Style Full Control Anti-Humidity Aerosol Hairspray. After 20 minutes, Ashley took out the rollers, brushed out the curls with a boar bristle brush and hit it again with the hairspray. She brushed back one side and pinned it behind Moore's ear, then finished the look with Garnier Fructis Style Texture Tease Dry Touch Finishing Spray.  So classic Hollywood! She could — and should — keep re-doing this look every decade."	1
"'Glee' actor Mark Salling, who pleaded guilty to child porn, found dead by apparent suicide  Mark Salling, the former Glee star who pleaded guilty to possessing child pornography and was scheduled to be sentenced in March, was found dead Tuesday, an apparent suicide. He was 35.  Ed Winter, spokesman for the Los Angeles County coroner's office, said Salling was found dead by the Los Angeles River in Sunland, Calif., the neighborhood in the San Gabriel Mountains where Salling resided. He was pronounced dead at 9 a.m. local time and an autopsy is pending.  The suspected cause is suicide by hanging, Winter said, but the final cause will be determined by autopsy.  Salling's lawyer, Michael Proctor, confirmed his death to USA TODAY.  ""I can confirm that Mark Salling passed away early this morning,"" Proctor said in an emailed statement to USA TODAY. ""Mark was a gentle and loving person, a person of great creativity, who was doing his best to atone for some serious mistakes and errors of judgment. He is survived by his mother and father, and his brother. The Salling family appreciates the support they have been receiving and asks for their privacy to be respected.""  Los Angeles Police Department spokeswoman Det. Meghan Aguilar earlier said police were conducting a “death investigation” in Sunland but declined to identify the body.  Salling was scheduled to be sentenced in early March under a plea agreement reached with federal prosecutors in October in which he admitted to possessing pornographic images of prepubescent children. The agreement stated that a search warrant found more than 50,000 images of child porn on Salling's computer and a thumb drive.  Salling, best known as Noah ""Puck"" Puckerman on Glee, was arrested in December 2015 after the LAPD's Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force served a search warrant on his home in the foothills of the San Gabriel Mountains.  In May 2016, he was charged in a federal indictment with receiving and possessing child pornography, the Justice Department in Los Angeles announced.  In the plea agreement, prosecutors agreed to ask a judge to sentence the actor to a prison term of four to seven years. He would also be required to register as a sex offender, pay restitution and abide by restrictions on where he could live.  Salling is the second former Glee actor to have died. Cory Monteith was found dead in a hotel room in Vancouver, British Columbia, in July 2013. He was 31. The local coroner determined Monteith's death was caused by accidental drug overdose due to a toxic mix of heroin and alcohol."	1
ABC has announced that Michael Strahan is leaving Good Morning America and will team up with The View co-host Sara Haines to host a new third hour of the news show called GMA Day. Sources say that the move comes after Strahan got upset over the addition of future baseball Hall-Of-Famer Alex Rodriguez as a GMA contributor.  “Tell your friends, tell your family, tell the whole town, shout it from the rooftops,” Strahan tweeted. “Starting September 10th @sarahaines and I will be hosting the 3rd hour of @GMA! #gmaday #gma”  Strahan has been a popular part of the morning news show since he left his job as co-host of Live! with Kelly Ripa in 2016. But recently, when the network hired Rodriguez without his input, he was not happy and felt threatened by the move.  We’re so excited to announce that @michaelstrahan and @sarahaines will be co-hosts of #GMADay – our new third hour, premiering Sept. 10 at 1pm ET / 12pm C/P! https://t.co/W5KClVZvJP pic.twitter.com/z9GkaM5irv — Good Morning America (@GMA) July 23, 2018  Instead of battling Rodriguez for airtime – or being worried about the former baseball player taking his place – Strahan made the move to the spinoff, and his future co-host is excited about the new show.  On Instagram, Haines wrote that she couldn’t find the words to adequately express her excitement about sitting next to Strahan on this new journey. She added that it has been a dream of hers for a long time, but it is bittersweet to leave The View.  GMA Day will premiere on Monday, September 10th, and air at 1 p.m. in the east and noon in the central and pacific time zones. It will be replacing The Chew, which ABC canceled after the sexual misconduct and rape allegations against star chef Mario Batali.  As for Rodriguez, Good Morning America has been giving him a ton of airtime, and insiders say it feels like he is starting to overshadow the six-foot-five Strahan. The sources add that A-Rod’s goal is to overtake Strahan as television’s “top jock.” In addition to his gig on GMA, Rodriguez is also the lead MLB analyst for FOX Sports, and he has been a guest judge on Shark Tank.  After his steroid scandal in 2014, Rodriguez has been attempting to rebuild his image. He comes across as quite the train wreck compared to the squeaky-clean Strahan. But ABC is willing to take the gamble, and Rodriguez will reportedly climb over anyone to achieve his goal.  His high-profile relationship with Jennifer Lopez also helps.  Insiders say that both Strahan and Rodriguez have “massive egos,” and Rodriguez joining GMA has caused Strahan to get jealous.  But, as Radar Online reports, Strahan is no stranger to how cutthroat TV can be. He shocked Ripa when he told her he was leaving her show for GMA just minutes before they went on the air.  However, insiders say that Strahan doesn’t believe Rodriguez deserves another chance, and he can’t believe his image renovation.  If there is any truth to the rumors that Strahan feels threatened by Rodriguez, though, many fans find it hard to believe. In addition to GMA, Strahan is also the host of the $100,000 Pyramid, and he co-hosts FOXs NFL pregame show during football season.  Advertisement  It seems like we will get multiple opportunities to see both Alex Rodriguez and Michael Strahan on television in the future.	0

But while the public were wondering why it took them so long to confirm their relationship, it seems to stem back to her five-year marriage to Tom Cruise.  Much has been reported about their bizarre divorce - and how Katie literally fled the country to get herself and daughter Suri away - but the actress has never spoken publicly about life as part of TomKat.  Here, we look back at the bizarre claims surrounding Tom's marriage rules for his wife...  Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8 Cancel Play now  Scientology elders 'audition for wives'  (Image: Eyevine)  After Tom's divorce from second wife Nicole Kidman, he began getting more into Scientology - the religious organisation he was introduced to by first wife Mimi Rogers in the late 1980s.  And there have been claims that Katie - who fancied Tom as a teenager - wasn't the Mission Impossible star's first pick.  According to the controversial book Going Clear: Scientology, Hollywood and the Prison Belief by Lawrence Wright, Tom invited Scientology elders to hold screen tests to find his next wife - a claim which the church's lawyers have denied.  But the author claimed a number of eligible Hollywood women were 'auditioned' by the church for the role of Tom's next spouse, including Lindsay Lohan, Scarlett Johansson and Jessica Alba.  Norwegian blonde Anette Iren Johansen said in 2015 that she'd been among the auditionees and claimed she'd been questioned later by a church elder about her sexual history - including whether she'd ever had threesomes or sex with a woman.  A spokesperson for the Church of Scientology told Mail Online at the time: ""There was no project, secret or otherwise, ever conducted by the Church to find a bride, via audition or otherwise, for any member.""  Monitoring Katie's pregnancy  (Image: WireImage)  When TomKat announced they were expecting their first child together in October 2005, doctors criticised Cruise for buying his own at-home ultrasound machine so he could keep an eye on Katie's womb.  Tom confessed he'd bought the high-tech equipment to use throughout his wife's pregnancy and said the couple would donate it to a hospital after she'd given birth, but medical specialists slammed his decision.  Some doctors warned that sonograms should only be carried out by certified technicians and only for medical purposes, as potential problems could be missed by untrained observers or the unborn child could be exposed to more sound waves than necessary.  Silent childbirth  (Image: <P>Pictured: Katie Holmes and Suri Cruise<P><B>Ref: SPL43985 120808 ...)  By far and away the strangest rule to come out of Tom and Katie's marriage was Cruise's insistence that his wife stay silent while she was giving birth to baby Suri.  According to Scientologists, labouring women should avoid screaming, groaning or even talking lest their words cause trauma to their newborn.  Even doctors and other staff attending the birth should refrain from speaking, according to Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard's rules.  ""Everyone must learn to say nothing within the expectant mother's hearing using labor and delivery,"" Hubbard wrote before his death.  ""Particularly during birth, absolute silence must be maintained and the more gentle the delivery, the better.""

"Let me ask you a question. If your friend's husband has been accused of cheating, would you go to the press or around town or wherever and announce that said husband has, in fact, flirted with you, too? OF COURSE YOU WOULDN'T, because you're a decent human being who doesn't kick your friends in the fucking shins when they're down. But when a certain former Real Housewife of New York City fame-lover sees a chance for press, she goes for the jugular. After reports surfaced that said Ramona Singer's husband funded the abortion of one of his mistresses, a ""friend"" of Ramona's has decided to add fuel to the fire. Jill Zarin says Mario Singer flirted with her until Bobby Zarin intervened and asked him to stop.  Jill literally gave an interview in which the sole purpose was to throw her friend under the bus. She told In Touch, ""When we were taping the show, Mario hit on me. It made me uncomfortable to the point where I had to tell [my husband] Bobby to tell Mario to leave me alone.""  But wait, the under bus throwing gets worse.  “He was always looking around,” she says. “People would talk about it, but nobody would ever say anything because they didn’t want to hurt Ramona. They felt bad for her.”  Then, just when you thought it couldn't get any more two-faced, she tells the magazine:  Ramona and I lived through an incredible experience together, so of course I will support her any way I can. Mario flirted with me as I saw him flirt with many other girls. The best thing for her to do is to stand tall and move on.  Do you see how that first sentence doesn't add up with the ones that follow? YOU CAN'T BE SUPPORTIVE AND THEN TELL A MAGAZINE THAT MARIO FLIRTED WITH YOU AND EVERYONE ELSE. Obviously, this really gets to me.  Listen, I'm not apologizing for Mario and I don't even find Ramona to be that sympathetic. It's just... ugh, Jill. She's the worst. No wonder she was kicked off the show — that mean streak is just too much. Even for Bravo."	1

"Today, Kensington Palace announced who will walk Meghan Markle down the aisle at the Royal Wedding tomorrow: The honor goes to her future father-in-law Prince Charles, the Prince of Wales.  ""Ms. Meghan Markle has asked His Royal Highness The Prince of Wales to accompany her down the aisle of the Quire of St. George's Chapel on her Wedding Day,"" Kensington Palace announced in a statement today. ""The Prince of Wales is pleased to be able to welcome Ms. Markle to The Royal Family in this way.""  But why Prince Charles?  Getty Images  Kensington Palace had previously announced that Meghan's father, Thomas Markle, would be walking her down the aisle. After it was confirmed that he wouldn't be able to attend the wedding after all, many suspected Meghan's mother, Doria Ragland, would step in to do the honor. Thomas Markle reportedly thought his ex-wife was the right person to take his place, and it was previously reported that Meghan wanted to break royal tradition from the beginning and have her mom, whom she is very close to, accompany her down the aisle at St George's Chapel.  But the reason why that isn't happening may be because of the Queen.  Meghan with her mother, Doria Ragland. Getty Images  MarieClaire.com's royal wedding expert, Caroline Castigliano, explains that by tradition, if the bride's father cannot be the one to give her away, it would then defer to the second male in her family: in Meghan's case, her half-brother, Thomas Jr. ""Normally it would go to the next male in line in her family, but I understand her brother is not coming. It's a very difficult situation.""    ""I think Harry would want to do what his grandmother sees as appropriate as a sign of respect to her,"" Castigliano continues. ""They just wouldn't have her mother walk her down the aisle because it wouldn't be what made the Queen feel comfortable, especially at her age.""    Because of this, Charles would be seen as the most appropriate choice because he's, well, a man, and Meghan's future father-in-law. It's a nice way for Prince Charles to show his support for his son, Prince Harry, as well as Meghan—but it would have been exciting for Meghan to buck to tradition and have her mother stand up with her on Saturday.  ""There's going to be all sorts of opportunities for Harry to break with tradition and get things to move in a slightly different direction, but at this point I'm sure his respect for the Queen is the most important thing,"" Castigliano says.  But according to a royal journalist, the reason may not be because of royal traditions at all—Charles may walk Meghan down the aisle in an effort to take some of the pressure off of her mother. Duncan Larcombe tells Harper's Bazaar UK that his sources report that Meghan did ask her mother to step in, but they decided it was too much in the end.  ""Doria and Meghan discussed it but she just didn't feel she could go through with it,"" Larcombe says. ""According to the guidance I've been given, Meghan felt that it would be too much to expect her mother to perform such an important role when more than one billion people are expected to be watching.""  Getty Images  Larcombe says it was actually Harry who thought Charles could be the one to step up. ""I'm told that it was Harry who suggested asking his father if he would step into the breach,"" he says, explaining that Charles, who has 69 years of royal experience under his belt, is the perfect solution. ""Just his presence by her side will calm Meghan and make the terrifying prospect of a royal wedding far less frightening. She will be able to let Charles take the lead and calmly make sure nothing goes wrong...In contrast if her mother was by her side, it would have been down to Meghan to perform that calming role."""	1

"Remember when all the Kardashians and Jenners got on and life was much simpler?  Us too. But now the back-and-forth shade between the three Kardashian sisters, Kris Jenner and her ex-husband Caitlyn Jenner is at an all time high.  Through a timeline of shade, we look back at what's been going on with America's most famous reality show family.  The family in 1995 Getty Images  June 2015: It all starts with the internet-breaking Vanity Fair interview - where she reveals her identity as Caitlyn to the world for the first time. Among the iconic pictures shot by Annie Leibowitz are comments about her relationship with Kris.  Vanity Fair  Firstly the two disagree on how much Caitlyn had told Kris about her gender identity issues, the fact she had taken female hormones in the 1980s and also dabbled with cross-dressing.  She also says the breakdown of their 23-year marriage was down to ""20 per cent gender and 80 per cent [was] the way I was treated"".  Kris tells the magazine Caitlyn was ""miserable"" and ""pissed off"" during the last years of their marriage.  August 2015: On Caitlyn's new E! show, I Am Cait, Khloe is seen visiting Caitlyn where she takes issue with her comments about Kris.  Caitlyn tells Khloe sent her ""tough"" text messages, to which Khloe responds: ""I said we don't care what you're doing... we want to be there and support you but we don't think that entails you speaking negatively about my mum. In our opinion you don't even need to mention my mum. Let's focus on the actual cause here and not drag my mum through the mud.""  October 2015: Season 10 of Keeping up with the Kardashians shows Kris' reaction to the Vanity Fair interview and she is, shall we say, more explicit with her wording.  ""He can go f*** himself,"" she cries down the phone to a deadpan Kim. ""I honestly wish I never met this man. I mean, just f*** you, Bruce.""  Caitlyn and Kris Jenner at the 2015 Victoria’s Secret show Getty Images  Kim tells the camera: ""All Caitlyn can talk about is that my mum mistreated her and was awful and all these really rude things, when there's no reason to bash my mum.""  November 2015: Khloe appears on the Ellen Show saying she had a particularly hard time accepting Caitlyn's transition because she found out on camera.    ""We kept asking him, 'Bruce, like what's going on? We're hearing all these rumours?' and he kept telling us one thing but really he knew he was transitioning and wouldn't be honest with us.  ""So really we felt like the last to know so that was hard for us, especially me.""  January 2016: Khloe appears on the Howard Stern Show where she is very candid about a whole lot of things, including Caitlyn.  Saying she found out about Caitlyn's transition at the same time that ""business people"" knew, despite repeatedly asking her whether the rumours about her transgender identity were true, she says she felt ""betrayed"".  ""We felt so like, 'what the f***? We've been asking you and why do business people know?' I never want someone to feel like they have one-up on our family. We are a family. We've never turned our backs on each other yet with all the clusterf***s of s*** that's happened in our lives, why would we now?  ""I don't give a f*** what you want to do - just stop lying to us about things... Just lay it on the table, what are we doing? What's happening? Even then he didn't tell us... we didn't know when he was going to start fully dressing as Caitlyn.""  May 2016: It later turns out that Caitlyn was not ok with what Khloe said on Howard Stern, as was revealed on the season 12 premiere of KUWTK.  According to Khloe, she was inundated with angry messages from Caitlyn after the interview so naturally she vented to matriarch Kris:  ""I said, 'You slaughtered my mother and you have the nerve to say, 'What happened to family sticking together?' You jumped that ship as soon as you did Diane Sawyer and attacked my mum', and instead, [she] tells me to 'get a life' and 'shut up' and I'm like, 'you shut up and you get a f***ing l"	0

Hot mama! Country singer Jessie James shows off her trim post-baby body at CMT Awards... just three months after giving birth  Jessie James didn't waste any time getting back into a LBD.  On Wednesday at the Country Music Television Awards in Nashville, the 26-year-old singer stunned in a very form-fitting dress just three months after giving birth to her daughter Vivianne.  But her mind didn't seem to be on her waistline at the star-studded event - rather, she seemed more interested in her 27-year-old football player husband Eric Decker who she snuggled up to on the carpet.  The beauty captioned a cute shot with her spouse that she posted to Instagram, 'With my love.'    Scroll down for video  Bouncing back! Jessie James displayed her streamline figure in a slinky black dress while attending the CMT Music Awards in Nashville, Tennessee on Wednesday - less than three months after giving birth  The long sleeved dress featured a plunging neckline and a knee-length skirt, which the Blue Jeans singer dressed up with towering nude platform pumps.    She glammed up the look with sparkling bangle bracelets and a silver pendant necklace . 'Thanks @jacqnerguizian for my gorgeous diamonds and jewelry you let me rock on the carpet last night. Love you!! #JNJewelsDesigns,' she wrote on Instagram.    Jessie’s long hair cascaded down in luxurious waves, as she highlighted her brown eyes with plenty of mascara and eyeliner.  Beautiful brunette: Jessie's long hair cascaded down in luxurious waves, as she highlighted her brown eyes with plenty of mascara and eyeliner  Handsome couple: The 26-year-old country music singer showed off her slender shape and ample curves, while joined by her football player husband, Eric Decker, 27 At the event, Jessie and Eric took a photo with model Brooklyn Decker. The singer made a funny face as she stooped down, facing the blonde. Brooklyn and Eric have the same last name but are not related.  Jessie and her New York Jets wide receiver husband wed in June 2013 and announced they were expecting their first child in September.    They welcomed Vivianne Rose Decker in March, with Eric sharing via Instagram shortly afterward: ‘What an amazing, life altering experience! A day of extreme intensity that is filled with raw emotion!  ‘I am a PROUD husband of such an incredibly tough and loving wife! I am a PROUD daddy to God’s greatest gift on earth, my little princess!’  Clowning around: The E! reality star shared this photo from the awards show alongside Brooklyn Decker - who is not related to Eric - writing, 'The Deckers @brooklynddecker @edeck87'  Post baby body: The mother-of-one shared this photo on April 13, having given birth on March 17 Curvaceous: She shared this photo recently, writing, '...Didn't realize how big my boobs have gotten from pregnancy and nursing!!! Ahhhh #dollypartonboobs #milkmommy'  Jessie shared one of her secrets to staying in shape with Glamour last October.    ‘I think the reason why we actually stay in shape—not only that Eric's a freak athlete and he works out every day his whole life—is that I cook everything at home from scratch.  'I know what I'm putting in everything, whether it's a gumbo or a jambalaya—I cook all Cajun food.’  Doting dad: Eric shared this photo, caressing his wife's belly during her pregnancy Ready to burst! Jessie Instagrammed this image of her and Eric when heavily pregnant  Meanwhile, the second season of the couple’s E! reality show, Eric & Jessie: Game On, premiered on March 30 – though the birth of their daughter was kept private.    ‘I'm going to probably have a personal camera to film the actual birth,’ Jessie told E! before the big day. ‘But there will not be a birth for people to see.    ‘It's something we wanted to keep personal to us, but you will see bits and pieces of that experience.’  	1
"NEW YEAR'S DAY... and New Year's Eve and the easy-breezier days that surround both may be some of the biggest movie-going occasions on the calendar, but a fan only need glance in the direction of a certain resort city at the start of the fresh year to see some mega pump-up-the-celluloid action. For that's always when the Palm Springs International Film Festival opens, and the fortnight-long fest always delivers a packed grid of quality flicks from very nearby (hi, LA) to less nearby (China, France, Belgium). But what's on the screens of the sunny enclave aren't the only draws of the two-week cinestravaganza; a bunch of big names show up to chat, to Q&A, and to walk various red carpets. Actor Gal Gadot and director Patty Jenkins of ""Wonder Woman"" will appear at the 2018 festival, as will actor Diane Kruger, who will talk about ""In the Fade"" with the film's director Faith Akin. The dates are...  JAN. 2 THROUGH JAN. 15... for the 29th annual PSIFF, and there are tickets available to numerous screenings, if you'd like to make a day of it in the desert. Venues include the Annenberg Theater, Camelot Theatre, and several other spots around the easy-to-navigate area, and the movies lined-up for the big show? The acclaimed ""Call Me By Your Name,"" ""The Last Movie Star"" with Burt Reynolds, and ""Darkest Hour"" are just three of the 180 flicks that'll get their star turn. Oh yes, and there's a secret screening, too, if that appeals, and the PSIFF staffers have offered a hint. Plus, you'll be in pretty P.S., where the weather is more than fine and the swimming pools glimmer, even in January (or perhaps especially in January). More films, more movies, more stars, more popcorns, more Q&A-ing, more cinefantastical-o-sity? One of the major events of moviedom is now flowering just beyond Mount San Jacinto, where winter's not too wicked and the films are wondrous.  Copyright NBC Owned Television Stations"	1
A$AP Rocky‘s house in LA has been burgled, with armed robbers reportedly stealing over $1 million of property from the rapper.  The Harlem rapper was the victim of the crime last night (May 16), with reports suggesting that up to $1.5 million worth of jewellery and additional property had been stolen from the residence.  As reported by TMZ, the armed gang – consisting of three thieves – reportedly pulled a gun on a female relative of Rocky’s who answered the door. She was then taken through the property by the gang as they proceeded to steal the rapper’s possessions.  Advertisement  Before making their getaway, the gang attempted to take a locked safe from the residence. However, they decided not to take it, and instead left it on a nearby pavement before fleeing the scene.  The rapper’s relative is not believed to have been physically harmed by the gang, but it is thought that the gang deliberately targeted Rocky’s house for the raid.  Rocky has yet to publicly respond to the robbery.

"The British royal family is a very private bunch, so consequently speculation about their personal lives runs rampant. And now that Pippa Middleton's wedding to James Matthews is approaching, gossip magazines (in particular, The Sun) are reporting that she has the royal equivalent of *beef* with Prince Harry's girlfriend Meghan Markle.  The specifics? Apparently, Markle won't be invited to Pippa's wedding thanks to a ""no ring, no bring"" policy—with a source noting, ""It's clear Pippa doesn't want to be outshone by any TV babes on her big day.""  Pippa Middleton and James Matthews attend Wimbledon in 2016. Getty Images  Interestingly, Pippa's future brother-in-law Spencer Matthews is also reportedly not allowed to bring his girlfriend, reality television star Vogue Williams. ""Pippa's view is that Vogue's relationship with Spencer is still very new. It wouldn't be appropriate for her to be there after just a few months of dating,"" the source says.

The late Notorious B.I.G.’s mother, Voletta Wallace, has slammed Kylie and Kendall Jenner over their latest marketing tool: “vintage” T-shirts with the pair’s faces superimposed over some of rap and rock’s biggest icons.  “I am not sure who told @kyliejenner and @kendalljenner that they had the right to do this,” Wallace captioned an image of one of shirts with a giant red X emblazoned over it. “The disrespect of these girls to not even reach out to me or anyone connected to the estate baffles me. I have no idea why they feel they can exploit the deaths of 2pac and my Son Christopher to sell a t-shirt. This is disrespectful, disgusting, and exploitation at its worst!!!”  I am not sure who told @kyliejenner and @kendalljenner that they had the right to do this. The disrespect of these girls to not even reach out to me or anyone connected to the estate baffles me. I have no idea why they feel they can exploit the deaths of 2pac and my Son Christopher to sell a t-shirt. This is disrespectful , disgusting, and exploitation at its worst!!! A post shared by Voletta Wallace (@volettawallace) on Jun 29, 2017 at 9:31am PDT  According to TMZ, Wallace’s lawyer, Julian Petty, also sent a cease-and-desist letter to the Jenners.  Sharon Osbourne, whose husband, Ozzy Osbourne, also had his likeness featured on one of the T-shirts, took aim at the Jenner sisters as well with a scathing tweet.  “Girls, you haven’t earned the right to put your face with musical icons,” she tweeted Thursday. “Stick to what you know … lip gloss.”  Girls, you haven’t earned the right to put your face with musical icons. Stick to what you know…lip gloss. pic.twitter.com/BhmuUVrDBn — Sharon Osbourne (@MrsSOsbourne) June 29, 2017  The T-shirts in question were unveiled on the sisters’ Kendall & Kylie online shop Wednesday, and featured images of Tupac Shakur, Biggie Smalls, Black Sabbath, Metallica, Pink Floyd, the Doors, Kiss and Led Zeppelin overlaid with Instagram shots of the model/reality star siblings; they retailed for $125 and had the words “Repurposed in the USA” printed on each. The reality stars have since removed the products from their site.  Reps for Metallica, Pink Floyd, Kiss and Led Zeppelin and the Shakur estate did not immediately respond to requests for comment.  On Thursday afternoon, Kendall and Kylie Jenner posted identical messages to Twitter apologizing for the theft. “These designs were not well thought out and we deeply apologize to anyone that has been upset and/or offended, especially to the families of the artists. We are huge fans of their music and it was not our intention to disrespect these cultural icons in anyway [sic]. The tee shirts have been pulled from retail and all images have been removed. We will use this as an opportunity to learn from these mistakes and again, we are very sorry.”  Kylie and Kendall’s misstep is only the latest in a long string of problematic marketing and business decisions plaguing the Kardashian-Jenner family.  Earlier this month, Kim Kardashian came under fire for ads for her new contouring kits, which featured a decidedly darker-skinned Kardashian. Critics slammed Kim for trying to hawk her beauty products by using blackface, an accusation that Kim sidestepped.  “I would obviously never want to offend anyone. I used an amazing photographer and a team of people. I was really tan when we shot the images, and it might be that the contrast was off,” she told the New York Times. “But I showed the image to many people, to many in the business. No one brought that to our attention. No one mentioned it.”  Khloe Kardashian faced her own controversy earlier this month too, after fashion designer Destiney Bleu accused her of copying her bedazzled clothing designs for her new Good American collection (with email receipts to back her up). Khloe roundly denied the claims, calling Bleu’s accusations “little more than a cheap publicity stunt.”  Less drama-prone sister Kendall caused an uproar – and an SNL skit – in A	0
"Nick Cannon showed up to the finale of America's Got Turbans—excuse me, America's Got Talent, wearing a glamorous headdress and a bejeweled brooch, and I am...puzzled.  Steve Granitz Getty Images  I mean, I know it's the last show of the season, but Cannon seems to be taking the phrase ""That's a wrap"" literally.  Steve Granitz Getty Images  He is giving us ""Grandmother of the Church on Easter Sunday all dressed up for dinner at Golden Corral"" with just a hint of ""Punjab from the movie Annie but not really because although we love Geoffrey Holder we recognize there are some issues with this character."" It's...a lot. And, like Sally Field at the end of Steel Magnolias, I want to know why.  You might think, Oh, this is just a wacky one-off. Some rogue stylist made a bold choice and Nick is just trying to downplay it. Out here like Daniel Bedingfield, muttering ""Gotta get through this..."" to himself. But, the gag is, he seems to be aware he's wearing a turban. And he wants you to know about it, too.  Steve Granitz Getty Images  First of all, Mother Cannon, I'm unclear about why you are pointing to the turban, as if our attention could be anywhere else. It is literally being held together by the North Star; we noticed.  Of course, Cannon has a propensity for pointing, even when it's not necessary. Take this photo from Red Nose Day:  NBC Getty Images  Photographer: Can you wear the nose, please?  Mother Cannon: I am wearing it.  Photographer: Yes, but it's supposed to go on your face. Like an actual nose.  Mother Cannon: I know. But this here is a nose finger. It's comedy. Ask about it. And I'm pointing to it so people know that this here is the joke. The nose finger. Scratch and sniff? Finger nose. Finger Cannon! I'm workshopping here. Is this too on the...what's the word I'm looking for?  Photographer: Nose?  Mother Cannon: Finger.  So, if you're taking notes at home for your Nick Cannon fashion journal, he sniffs at red noses but will turn up for a turban. And it's not a new development.  Here he is at the VMAs, in a sleeveless look giving you Aunt Joanne at the Labor Day cookout:  Dimitrios Kambouris Getty Images  This look says, ""My macaroni and cheese recipe may be suspect, but my bank account is on point.""  And here he is in a black turban, giving you Aunt Joanne in mourning for recently deceased president of the church usher board. Yes, he will be bringing a dish to the funeral. Why do you ask?  GVK Getty Images  Now, I watched Real Husbands of Hollywood, so I know that Nick is a shrewd business person who is rolling in cash, so he can do whatever he wants. He probably has a stack of hundreds shoved up in that turban right next to his Werther's Originals and his spare handkerchief. But I'm going to need some backup testimony before I can accept this turban ministry.  Right now he's giving me ""Glenn Close but no cigar"":  Like, is this the look? Is Nick Cannon slowly turning into Norma Desmond right before our eyes?  I mean, I would not mind that at all. It sounds hilarious.  But I suspect Mother Cannon has his sights on another grand dame of the screen.  This latest lewk is 100 percent Dominique Deveraux and if this is what Nick Cannon is trying to give us, I am here for it!  ABC Archives Getty Images  Here for this!  Here for that Professor Quirrell realness!  ABC Archives Getty Images  Here for this casual day look!  Not everyone will be on board Nick's slow but heady transformation into Diahann Carroll.  But I say ignore the haters.  I salute you, Nick Cannon. Live your ""matriarch of the family,"" ""it's too hot out here to be wearing a wig anyway"" truth. You keep that head held high! No matter how heavy all the fabric wrapped around it is.  Follow R. Eric Thomas on Twitter."	0
Thanks to her former modeling career, Melania Trump can turn even the most casual outfit into a major fashion moment, and she has consistently wowed Us with her classic-with-a-twist style choices since moving to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue (a.k.a. the White House).  It became clear from the onset that the Slovene-born beauty was taking wardrobe cues from previous trendsetting first ladies. For the inauguration in January 2017, she wore a pale blue Ralph Lauren cashmere coat dress with matching suede pumps and gloves that called to mind Jackie Kennedy’s chic style, and she’s continued to rock high-fashion designs ever since. Though, much like former first lady Michelle Obama before her, Melania’s outfits keep Us guessing.  Whether she was hosting her first state dinner for French President Emmanuel and First Lady Brigitte Macron in a sparkling Chanel Haute Couture gown (which originally appeared on the brand’s spring 2018 runway as a jumpsuit) or sporting a pastel Burberry coat to read to children at the annual White House Easter Egg Roll, the First Lady’s wardrobe creatively and tastefully embraces color, texture and design. Oh, and we will forever be amazed by her ability to have a rainbow-hued stiletto (Christian Louboutin is her fave) to match just about any outfit.  Here at Stylish, we’ve been keeping tabs on her most, well, stylish moments both at home and abroad. Keep scrolling to see her best looks!	1
"Janet Jackson broke down in tears onstage in Houston on Saturday while singing her heartbreaking abuse track, What About.  The 51-year-old, who recently resumed her tour following the birth of her son Eissa in December, wept and shook with emotion as she struggled to sing the lyrics onstage at the Toyota Centre.  Through tears, the mother-of-one was then heard telling the crowd: 'This is me', after singing words about domestic violence and infidelity, including: 'What about the times you hit my face?'  Scroll down for video  Emotional: Janet Jackson broke down in tears onstage in Houston on Saturday while singing her heartbreaking abuse track, What About  The track featured on her 1997 album The Velvet Rope.  Janet was overcome with emotion as she belted out the lyrics, which include: 'What about all the s**t you've done to me? / What about the times you hit my face? / What about the times you kept on when I said no more, please?'  Momentarily pausing during the song as her tears began to fall however, the pop star then straightened up and simply told the crowds: 'This is me.'  Staying strong: Janet was overcome as she belted out the lyrics, which include: 'What about all the s**t you've done to me? / What about the times you hit my face?' and told fans 'This is me'  Janet was also reportedly overwhelmed during the first show of her State of the World tour in Louisiana on Thursday, when she performed the same track.  The pop star has just resumed her tour after welcoming her first child Eissa in January, with estranged husband Wissam Al Mana.  The Scream hitmaker had called off her Unbreakable World Tour in April 2016, in order to have her first child, at the age of 50.  The songstress is currently in the process of divorcing the Qatari business magnate following their split in April 2017 after five years of marriage.  Back at it: The pop star has just resumed her tour after welcoming her first child Eissa in January, with estranged husband Wissam Al Mana  Janet previously said her divorce from Wissam was 'in God's hands', in a special video posted to announce her plans to return to live performing.  She told fans in the clip, shared in May: 'I just want to keep it real with you guys for a second. Yes, I separated from my husband, we are in court and the rest is in God's hands.'  However her brother Tito, 63, recently confessed his sister loves being a mother to her eight-month-old son Eissa.

She’s a real mother. She loves it. I asked her, ""How are you getting along with this?’ and she said, ‘Tito, I love it.’ She just loves her baby.""  'She’s great at being a mother. It’s really great. I guess it sort of makes her feel complete.'  Despite her outpouring of emotion on stage, Janet's make-up artist Preston Meneses also insisted the Rhythm Nation hitmaker was in 'good spirits'.  Speaking ahead of the tour, Preston said: 'I think Janet is ready! She is happy and is in good spirits. I think the world is going to get something really special from her.  'She's really excited. We all are - a lot of us have been working together for years so when we come together, it's just like being with your family and when you work with your family, things just come easy and it's a wonderful experience.'  The emotional appearance comes after Janet visited evacuees at the George R. Brown Red Cross Center in the city, following the destruction caused by Hurricane Harvey.

Brown Center with Mayor Sylvester Turner and her brother Randy Jackson on Friday  The Toyota Center, where the concert took place, revealed via Twitter that Janet would be donating proceeds from the gig to hurricane relief efforts.

Justin Timberlake‘s hatred for reality TV became very apparent during Sunday’s MTV Video Music Awards when he repeatedly asked MTV to ditch reality TV and play more music videos.  The girls from The Hills — Lauren Conrad, Audrina Patridge, Whitney Port — were supposed to present Timberlake with Male Artist of the Year but after Lauren announced Justin as the winner, things got a little strange.  A fourth female mysteriously showed up on stage to join The Hills girls to hand the moon man to Timbaland, who in turn gave it to Justin. Justin did not give eye contact or thank any of the presenters, as most winners do.  “Play more dayum videos. We don’t want to see the Simpsons on reality television,” said Justin, referring to sisters Jessica and Ashlee Simpson. “Play more videos.”  And then when accepting the award for the Quadruple Threat Award, Justin reiterated, “I want to challenge MTV to play more videos.”  Watch the video below and see for yourself!!!!!  Ironically, Justin is one of Lauren‘s celebrity crushes.    Justin Timberlake snubs The Hills	1

Revealed: Katy Perry says she takes 26 pills a day, travels with a teddy bear, believes in aliens and has OCD  Katy Perry clearly doesn't like keeping her quirks close to her vest.  In a new interview with UsWeekly , the Prism singer doles out some eye-opening facts in the magazine's 25 Things You Don't Know About Me column.  Among the humdingers: she believes in aliens, takes 26 pills a day and has OCD. And, endearingly, she admits she always travels with her teddy bear.  Scroll down for video    Cute and quirky: In a new interview with UsWeekly, Katy Perry - seen here on Sunday - reveals all kinds of things, like that she believes in aliens and has a ticket to outer space  KATY PERRY'S TOP 10 REVEALS  1. has a ticket to outer space 2. her natural hair color is 'squirrel brown' 3. she's never had any plastic surgery 4. takes 26 pills a day 5. has OCD 6. will be an aunt soon 7. believes in aliens 8. brushes her teeth up to six times a day 9. travels with her teddy bear 10. friends think she's a hoarder    The Grammy favorite explains of her condition, 'I'm so OCD that I wish the letters OCD were in alphabetical order: CDO.'  This may have to do with why the 28-year-old brushes her teeth 'four to six times a day,' which is another reveal to the weekly.    As far as her fascination with material items, she has this to say: 'Everyone in my life seems to think I'm a hoarder, but if you ask me, I'm a collector!'  The pills have a reason too. 'I'm all about vitamins and supplements.'  The girlfriend of John Mayer lets it slip that she is soon to became an aunt. She doesn't say if the parent will be her younger brother David Hudson or her older sister Angela. (Katy was born Katheryn Hudson.)    She also points out that she's never had any plastic surgery - this comes after internet speculation that those generous ta-tas are not hers.  The down-to-earth beauty also has a fascination with things out there: she says she believes in aliens and has a ticket to outer space.  Getting the message out: The singer opened up to the weekly to promote her album Prism, which was released on Friday  She didn't talk about John Mayer but...: She did reveal her favourite designer was Chanel  She keeps her mind clear with transcendental meditation but has bad habits too.  'My comfort food is chicken nuggets, but only the boot-shaped ones,' she reveals. She also confesses, 'My favourite ice cream is Cold Stone Creamery's Birthday Cake Remix.'    As far as fashion, 'My top label is Chanel.'  She discusses her past too, saying, 'At age 13, I was in a car wreck that left me crawling out of a broken window.'  Another tidbit: 'The first solo I ever performed in public was Edelweiss from The Sound Of Music.'    And she lets on that her natural hair colour is 'squirrel brown.'  She also has travel on her mind.  'One of my goals on the next tour is to make a pit stop at Dollywood in Tennessee,' she admits and also says her bucket lists includes 'climbing Machu Picchu.'  The Santa Barbara native reveals that she made more than half of her new album - Prism, which was released Friday - in her hometown's luxurious resort San Ysidro Ranch, where John F. Kennedy honeymooned with Jakie, and where Hilary Duff wed Mike Comrie. 'It's the best hotel on the planet,' she insists.  There is not one mention of boyfriend John, who she recently called a 'genius,' or her ex-husband Russell Brand.	1
There’s been enough drama between Tyrese Gibson and Dwayne “The Rock “Johnson.  In a series of social shade, Gibson surfaced a video on his Instagram account of Johnson criticizing his sixth studio album Black Rose, which Gibson released back in 2015.  In the video, Johnson referred to the “new album” as ‘the biggest piece of dog sh-t that I have ever heard” and claimed everyone agreed with him.  “everyone is like a big piece of dog sh-t .it shouldn’t be called Black Rose. It should be called a big piece of sh-t. that’s what it should be called,” Johnson said in part of the video.” Not even the hard dried dog sh_t for seven days .its the soft dog sh-t .its like baby sh-t.”  Johnson went on to say that he never wanted to listen to the album again.  “ I’m never going to f—king forgive him for wasting my time,” he said in the video.” This is time I will never get back. its like dog sh-t is in my ear, mother—ker.”  “Haters come in many forms…… In my Kanye voice #, BlackRose is one of the greatest R&B Soul Albums of all time my single #SHAME was #1 on Billboard for 16 weeks my album came in #1 on the TOP 200!!! Real R&B music lovers know….. This album is in a league of its own #BlackRose”  But the drama doesn’t end there. After the release date for fast and furious 9 was announced, Gibson criticized Johnson.  ‘#PSA, congratulations to @The Rock and your brother in law aka 7bucks producing partner @hhgarcia41 for making the fast and furious franchise about you.”  He continued to say “Gnn folks see you in 2020 April #3fast family right? Nah….its about #Team Dewayne#3yrs will be worth the wait?3NoShaw just Hobbs will this be another #baywatch?Guys just relax I’m a passionate film critic.”  The Rock has yet to publicly respond to Gibson’s social post, meanwhile, we will just have to wait and see how this drama ends- hopefully, before fast and furious 9 hits the theatres in April 2020	1
Selena Gomez has a new album coming out and after being inspired by a lot of the tough times she went through, it’s sure to be incredibly touching. Will her feelings about Justin or The Weeknd rule the track list?  Selena Gomez, 25, has been through quite a lot this past year, including her breakup with The Weeknd, 28, and her make up with Justin Bieber, 24, and her new album, which is due for release in a few months, will reportedly be about both of them! “Selena Gomez is anxious and excited for fans to hear her heartfelt new album,” a source close to Selena shared EXCLUSIVELY with HollywoodLife. “She had hoped it would have been out by now, but she is constantly reworking tracks and adding new music and collabs, so it may not be ready to drop until the fall. She loves all of her new songs, and can’t wait for her fans to hear her new music. She has been working hard on the album, writing everything from the heart, and alludes to everything and everyone in her life. She will Include some subtle, and some more obvious, references to both Justin and The Weeknd. She is anxious to get the album released and hopes for fans to hear it as soon as possible.”  In addition to Selena’s dating situations, she of course went through her lifesaving kidney surgery after a struggle with lupus. We can’t help but wonder if her experience with that will be included on the album as well. If any of her past albums are an indication, we’re sure Selena will opt to open up about her rough moments to help inspire her fans and we’re all for it!  The talented singer recently made headlines for releasing the official music video for her song “Back to You” from the season 2 soundtrack of 13 Reasons Why. The song is rumored to be about Justin and with lyrics such as, “I wanna hold you when I’m not supposed to” and “I know I’d go back to you”, we can see why! If this song is any indication of what to expect from Selena’s upcoming album, we’re in for a treat!	0

I’m naturally nurturing, and I just can’t wait to have our baby,” Jade said of her husband, known to work long hours as general sales manager at Legends Toyota.  Jade, who once considered working as a doula, told In Touch she’d like to have an at-home water birth if the pregnancy is low-risk. “But Tanner’s a little concerned,” she said.  Love happened quickly for Tanner, 29, who grew up in Overland Park, and Jade, 30, who within a few weeks’ time in 2015 met, fell in love and got engaged on “Bachelor in Paradise 2,” a spinoff of ABC’s “The Bachelor.”  Earlier, Tanner had competed on the Kaitlyn Bristowe season of “The Bachelorette,” and Jade was one of Chris Soules’ final four on “The Bachelor.”  They recently celebrated their first wedding anniversary. They married in California in January 2016 in a ceremony ABC aired the next month on Valentine’s Day.  Their relationship hit the shoals of wedded bliss when they appeared on “Marriage Boot Camp” last year. After a lot of arguing and tears shed, Jade told Us Weekly the experience was “good” for them.  They found out Jade was pregnant after she took an at-home pregnancy test, they told In Touch. “Jade cried a little bit. I was just really excited,” Tanner said. The baby is due Sept. 14.  The two bought land in the Stilwell area last year to build a house, clearly with a future family on their minds.  Adulting real hard today. Tanner and I just put a deposit down on a few acres to build our home together! ❤️ #jannerforever #jannermanor A post shared by Jade Tolbert (@jadelizroper) on Jan 10, 2016 at 2:30pm PST  “We bought four and a half acres out there because Jade wanted to have horses like she did growing up, and that’s our plan,” Tanner told Bustle last year.  They planned a four-bedroom home with five-and-a-half bathrooms and a man cave for possible “Bachelor” viewing parties.  “We will watch down there cause nothing says ‘man cave’ like watching ‘The Bachelor,’ right?” Tanner joked to Bustle.  At the time, Jade said she was working with an interior designer to create a scheme unlike the Kansas City style she described to Bustle as dark wood and dark walls.  “I want to really lighten it up and make it kind of Parisian,” she said. “So I want a white kitchen with lots of windows and natural light.”  She had hinted to Us Weekly at a “Bachelor” premiere event in Los Angeles in January that the couple had “babies on the mind.”  “We’re building a house, and it’s got a lot of room for children! I just turned 30 in December, so I’m ready,” the former Playboy model said. “I would love a baby in 2017.”	1

"She's the one who got away! It's hard to believe that it's only been one year since Kylie Jenner and Tyga split — especially because so much has changed for Kylie since then. The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star is now a mom to an adorable little girl named Stormi Webster — whom she shares with her new boyfriend, rapper Travis Scott — and even though she's already moved on and had a whole baby with another man, sources exclusively revealed to In Touch that Tyga isn't really over Kylie.  ""Even though they’re not together, Tyga misses Kylie. For real,"" the insider told In Touch. ""He misses her sexiness. Her body. The lavish life, connections, money and exposure she gave him. He misses all of that and kicks himself every day for letting their relationship die.""  Kylie and Tyga dated for about three years — which is an eternity in celeb time — but they broke up in 2017 shortly after Valentine's Day. Fans were shocked to learn that Kylie had moved on so quickly from Tyga when she started dating Travis in April 2017 — and it was even more shocking that she got pregnant less than two months into their relationship. Sources revealed that Kylie's pregnancy was especially hard for Tyga to accept, because he eventually hoped to start a family with the lip kit mogul — and even though Kylie seems to be happy and in love with Travis and their little family, Tyga is still holding on to hope that there might still be a chance for him to get back togegther with her.  ""What’s worse: she’s got a baby with Travis. That gnaws at him,"" the insider continued. ""He wanted to be the one who gave Kylie a baby. He wanted that so much but she was opposed. Tyga’s pissed about that. But even still, he forgives her because he loves her. And he knows he could still have a baby with her later down the line if they were ever to rekindle the passion they once had.""

    Queer Eye star Karamo Brown proposed to his boyfriend of eight years, Ian Jordan, on Wednesday, May 9 — and it’s safe to say they will have one stylish wedding.  Brown, 37, popped the question during Jordan’s surprise 40th birthday party at sbe’s HYDE Sunset in L.A. The Netflix series’ culture expert dropped down on one knee and presented his director love with a silver David Yurman band, Entertainment Tonight reported on Wednesday, May 9.  “You are the funniest man I know, the kindest man, my biggest cheerleader,” Brown told Jordan, per ET. “You made me feel like I could do anything. . . . I hope we can conquer the world together for the rest of our lives. Ian Lamont Jordan, will you marry me?”  Brown’s son Jason then made a speech. (Brown learned of Jason’s existence when he received papers from his high school girlfriend demanding overdue child support. At the time, Jason was 10. The reality star adopted Jason in 2007 and then adopted his half-brother in 2010.)  Queer Eye’s Fab Five — Bobby Berk, Antoni Porowski, Jonathan Van Ness and Tan France — were all there to celebrate with their costar. France captured the proposal on camera and shared it on Instagram Stories, writing: “I couldn’t be happier for you, KK and Ian!”  That night, the Real World: Philadelphia alum shared a prom-style portrait of himself with his director beau on Instagram.  “I love you because of your heart, your humor, but mostly because you don’t mind serving #GlamourShots realness w/ me anytime I ask,” wrote Brown. “I pray today and this year brings you everything your heart desires.”  Meanwhile, Us Weekly exclusively reported on Wednesday Queer Eye fan favorite Tom Jackson recently remarried his ex-wife!

ABC has set summer premiere dates for Season 5 of Bachelor in Paradise. The reality-competition series will launch with a two-hour episode at 8 PM Tuesday, August 7.  Coming off a scandal-plagued fourth season, Bachelor in Paradise again returns unchosen contestants from The Bachelor or The Bachelorette for a second (or third) chance at finding love. Out to mend those broken hearts, they will travel to a romantic paradise in hope of turning a potential summer fling into the real thing.  ABC  Last summer, Warner Bros. suspended production on Bachelor in Paradise in Mexico due to an allegation of sexual misconduct, and the show’s survival was in doubt. ABC’s Good Morning America reported on June 13 — two days after filming was halted — that contestant DeMario Jackson and a “fellow contestant,” later revealed to be Corinne Olympios, reportedly were engaging in a sex act while they were “both intoxicated.” The pair lawyered up the next day, but the show resumed production about later that month after an internal network investigation found no misconduct.  Olympios did not return for the salvaged Season 4 but took part in the reunion episode.  Hosted by Chris Harrison, Bachelor in Paradise is a production of Next Entertainment in association with Warner Horizon Unscripted & Alternative Television. Mike Fleiss, Martin Hilton, Nicole Woods and Elan Gale are the executive producers.	1

Riverdale‘s Cooper family is getting bigger (and more complicated): Relative newcomer Hart Denton has been cast as Betty’s long-lost brother Chic, TVLine has learned exclusively.  The actor/musician’s only previous TV acting credit is an episode of Fox’s Lethal Weapon that aired last year, but he certainly looks the part of a Cooper — blonde hair and all. (Remember last season, when Veronica theorized that Betty’s brother must be some “blonde Adonis”? Well, she wasn’t wrong.)  As we reported last week, the role of Chic will be recurring in Season 2; Denton will make his Riverdale debut midway through the upcoming season, which debuts next Wednesday at 8/7c on The CW. We first learned about Chic in last season’s finale, when Betty’s mom Alice confessed that she got pregnant in high school and gave the baby — who grew up to be Chic — up for adoption.  Chic’s not the only new arrival heading to Riverdale this season: Mark Consuelos (Pitch, The Night Shift) joins the cast as Veronica’s father Hiram Lodge, who’s fresh out of prison, and Graham Phillips (The Good Wife) will play Veronica’s old school pal Nick St. Clair, a troublemaking rich kid who figures into what showrunner Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa is calling “potentially the darkest storyline we’ve told.”  Alright, Riverdale fans: Does Denton look the part of Betty’s brother? And how will he figure into Season 2’s drama? Toss out your theories in the comments.	1
She's one of the world's great beauties.  And on Thursday, Zoe Saldana showed off her stunning form in four different summery looks for June's issue of Nexos magazine for American Airlines.  The 39-year-old Guardians of the Galaxy actress appears on the cover in a white, ruffled tulle garment that sports on almost-off-the-shoulder element.  Stunner! On Thursday, Zoe Saldana showed off her stunning form in four different summery looks for Nexos magazine  On her left shoulder sat a very prominent velvet bow in a lime green color which added an unexpected hue, while some very unique gold earrings appeared to be her only other accessory.  Of course her make-up, consisting of a candy red lip, dark eye shadow and subtle blush, was exquisite.  Her brunette tresses are parted simply in the middle and fell down past her shoulders.  Inside, the Avatar star appeared in three more very flattering dresses.  Off-balance: It seemed more asymmetry was on tap, as her second outfit was a beautiful crimson affair which featured a large bit of fabric over only the left shoulder  It seemed more asymmetry was on tap, as her second outfit was a beautiful crimson affair which featured a large bit of fabric over only the left shoulder.  Her right arm was covered by a sleeve all the way to the elbow, while a low-cut neck offered up just a hint of her decolletage.  Some extremely long gold pendant earrings looked to be her only accessory.  Things then got a little more retro thanks to a yellow and pink pastel number that sported sheer sleeves and a floral pattern reminiscent of those popular in the 1960s.  Unexpected!

Things then got a little more retro thanks to a yellow and pink pastel number that sported sheer sleeves and a floral pattern reminiscent of those popular in the 1960s  Her earwear turned even more elaborate, with each ear hosting a large hoop with a gem hovering in the center.  Colors were once again front and center in the final look, which saw the mother-of-three don a multi-hued frock with a zigzag pattern.  The garment included an incorporated belt and a very low neckline which offered up a glimpse of her ample assets.  She once again changed up her earrings, opting for a set of copper-colored two charm pieces.	1
"Happy 15th anniversary to ""The Simple Life.""  Paris Hilton honored the reality show that ran for five seasons between 2003 and 2007 by sharing a picture with co-star Nicole Richie and a throwback video on her Instagram.  ""Happy 15 Year Anniversary to #TheSimpleLife. Loves it! So many fun, amazing & hilarious memories with Nicole,"" Hilton captioned the promotional picture of the two parodying the Grant Wood's famous painting, ""American Gothic.""  ""Love that this show is so timeless & iconic,"" she continued. ""And that it has brought so much happiness and laughter to people around the world. And the #Legend Tinkerbell who I love & miss very much. #TheOG’s.""  Nicole hasn't addressed the show's anniversary on social media today, but Paris' posts are making fans reminisce since she shared a montage of what we assume are some of Paris' favorite moments.  The first season of ""The Simple Life"" followed the two socialites (now both very successful boss ladies and entrepreneurs!) living with the Leding family on their farm in Arkansas for a month. During their tumultuous stay, they tried and failed at basically every blue-collar job that was thrown their way, and TV viewers ate it up. At its peak, millions of viewers were tuning in to watch the wealthy young women -- who had never worked a day in their lives before that -- mix and mingle with average Americans.  Watch this incredible montage below to remember the priceless moment when Paris and Nicole stunned their southern hosts by having the audacity to ask, ""What is Walmart?"""	1
"Performers including D'Lo and Scott Turner Schofield try out for Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow in 'The Avengers' films and Samantha in 'Her.'  A group of trans men have produced a video response to the controversial casting of Scarlett Johansson as the lead in the upcoming film Rub & Tug.  In a video published Friday, performers D'Lo, Justin Chow, Scott Turner Schofield and Rocco Kayiatos (who goes by the stage name Katastrophe) try out for cisgender parts the actress has played across her career: Rebecca in 2001's Ghost World, Samantha in 2013's Her, Anna in 2009's He's Just Not That Into You and Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow in the Avengers films.  Johansson sparked controversy in early July when it was announced that she would be playing the role of Jean Marie Gill, also known as Dante ""Tex"" Gill, a real-life massage parlor and prostitution business operator who was assigned female at birth but assumed the identity of a man later on in life, in Rupert Sanders' upcoming film Rub & Tug. Though it's unclear how they identified, Gill's obituary stated that they preferred to be called ""Mr. Gill"" and speculated that they had undergone sex reassignment surgery.  Trans actresses Trace Lysette (Transparent) and Jamie Clayton (Sense8, The Neon Demon) protested Johansson's casting, arguing that trans actors have enough trouble getting work in Hollywood and should not be deprived of the opportunity to play a rare character of their identity.  The video, produced by the queer digital magazine INTO, parodies Johansson's casting by envisioning a situation where a transgender man (Schofield) is offered one of Johansson's roles but turns it down because ""cis women are actually really marginalized in Hollywood, you know?""  Schofield adds, ""I know that there are people who have lived this experience and would bring a lot of authenticity to it, and I feel a little weird taking that from them. Thank you so much for the opportunity and no thanks.""  In a comment attributed to Johansson via her representative that was sent to the digital magazine Bustle in early July, she replied to her critics, ""Tell them they can be directed to Jeffrey Tambor, Jared Leto, and Felicity Huffman’s reps for comment.” The Hollywood Reporter could not confirm the comment.  Watch the video below."	1

"Examining the sisters-in-law at Wimbledon, Ms James said it is clear they share a close bond which is due to the unusual situation they have found themselves in. It is also partly due to Meghan Markle adopting Prince Harry’s fun personality. Ms James said: “Kate is always very much the pitch-perfect princess in terms of her regal-but-warm-looking body language and the levels of confidence she displays at royal events. “Her Achilles heel was always Harry who often looked duty-bound to make her laugh or giggle and it seems from the body language here that Meghan might be adopting a similar role to try and forge a familiar and very congruent friendship with her sister-in-law.  “While Kate sits smiling as she watches the tennis, Meghan face-checks her closely in what looks a little like admiration bordering on hero-worship.” The expert claimed the trait would suggest she's keen to take her lead from Kate. She added: “Meghan's raised brows, wide eyes and her clapping hand gesture shows a genuine excitement for the event and the company and when she turns her very contagious grin on Kate you can see a possible hint of some growing behind-the-scenes fun between the two women.” Ms James also said the women are truly friends and not just for the camera.  Judi also says the women are truly friends and not just for the camera  Although both women are 36, Ms Markle acts a lot younger, according to the body language expert. Speaking to The Sun, she continued: “The smiles entail rounded cheeks and eye-crinkling that lets us know they are authentic. ""It's what each woman does with their smiles that defines them as two rather different personalities. ""While Kate keeps her eye contact down or to the side, Meghan's eyes to the crowds and her dipped head and rather shy, lowered smile forms what is known as ‘The Cute Effect’, a trait of using pseudo infantile body language to lower your own status and form instant bonds of likeability.  Although both women are 36, Ms Markle acts a lot young, according to Ms James  ""So although these two women are the same age Kate's signals make her look more grown up than the very excited-looking Meghan."" Kate, who is currently on maternity leave, is the more experienced royal of the two, having married Prince William back in 2011. She waved to crowds as she entered alongside Kate, who wore a white dress."	0

Many fans were shocked when it was first confirmed that Robert Pattinson ended his relationship with FKA Twigs after many years of dating. Speculation about the former couple’s breakup sparked after the Twilight actor said that he was “kind of” engaged to the “Pendulum” singer during an appearance on The Howard Stern Show in July 2017. New reports suggest that the former beau of Kristen Stewart is now ready to move on from the English musician.  Rumors have it that Robert Pattinson is exclusively seeing Kylie Minogue. A mutual pal reportedly set up Kristen Stewart’s ex-boyfriend and the “Can’t Get You out of My Head” songstress in December 2017. It was even claimed that Kylie brought the Twilight actor to her Melbourne flat.  “They have a lot in common and seem to like each other a lot.”  This is not the first time the Robert Pattinson and Kylie Minogue were rumored to be hitting on each other. As a matter of fact, the two sparked dating rumors after the former fiance of FKA Twigs was sighted kissing the Aussie singer at Cannes Films Festival in May 2014. People shared that Robert and Kylie exchanged kisses when they appeared on a special edition of a French talk show.  Aside from Kylie Minogue, Robert Pattinson was also linked to Bella Hadid lately. The Cosmopolis star and Gigi Hadid’s younger sister sparked romance rumors after they were allegedly spotted getting flirty with each other at the recent Dior Homme Menswear show in Paris. HollywoodLife shared that Robert and Bella “make a good looking couple” while posing for photos at the event. The publication shared that brief encounter possibly “hints at a new relationship.”  Earlier this week, an unnamed Wonderwall source claimed that Robert Pattinson was seen kissing Katy Perry in Los Angeles. Together with their pals, the former Twilight star and the “Roar” singer reportedly had dinner at Taix French Restaurant in Echo Park on Friday, Feb. 26. The eyewitness claimed that Robert and Katy were “making out,” adding that they look like a real couple.  Prior to the most recent claim, Robert Pattinson and Katy Perry have repeatedly denied the reports saying that they are dating. The duo has emphasized that they are just close to each other. “He’s my bud, I’m like his big sister,” the “Thinking of You” hitmaker previously said.  While these dating reports could be true, Gossip Cop has already debunked these rumors. The news outlet stated that Robert Pattinson and Kylie Minogue had not developed a romance despite the dating reports. An unnamed tipster also revealed to the publication that the former beau of Kristen Stewart did not cozy up with Bella Hadid and described the claim as “wrong” and “dumb.”  Loading...  They were totally caught making out!https://t.co/FJlsvlxlu2 — HollywoodLife (@HollywoodLife) January 28, 2018  In another report, the popular fact-checking website also claimed that Robert Pattinson and Katy Perry were not “spotted kissing” during a “flirty dinner.” An unidentified informant close to the ex-girlfriend of Orlando Bloom reportedly clarified that “such a thing never happened.” The publication also blasted HollywoodLife for claiming that Robert has been “majorly crushing” on the “Teenage Dream” hitmaker.  New titles added include Robert Pattinson's 'Damsel' https://t.co/QaIevHBvmr — Variety (@Variety) January 15, 2018  After his infamous split from FKA Twigs, Robert reportedly wants to focus more on his career.

For portraying Billy Flynn in the Academy Award-winning musical Chicago (2002), he won a Golden Globe Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award as part of the cast.  Early life and education  Gere was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; he grew up in Syracuse, New York.[5] His mother, Doris Ann (née Tiffany, 1924–2016),[1] was a housewife. His father, Homer George Gere (born 1922),[1] was an insurance agent for the Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company and had originally intended to become a minister.[6] Gere is their eldest son and second child.[1]  His paternal great-grandfather George Lane Gere (1848-1932) had changed the spelling of the surname from ""Geer"".[1] The direct paternal ancestor is George Geer along with his brother Thomas from Heavitree, Devon, England who settled in Connecticut Colony in 1638.[1][7] Both of his parents were Mayflower descendants; Gere's ancestors include Pilgrims Francis Eaton, John Billington, George Soule, Richard Warren, Degory Priest, Francis Cooke, and William Brewster.[1]  In 1967, Gere graduated from North Syracuse Central High School, where he excelled at gymnastics and music and played the trumpet.[6] He attended the University of Massachusetts Amherst on a gymnastics scholarship, majoring in philosophy; after two years, he left and did not graduate.[6][8]  Career  Stage  Gere first worked professionally at the Seattle Repertory Theatre and the Provincetown Playhouse on Cape Cod in 1969, where he starred in Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead.

He played a small but memorable part in Looking for Mr. Goodbar (1977) and starred in director Terrence Malick's well-reviewed drama Days of Heaven (1978).[6] The crime drama American Gigolo (1980) significantly boosted his profile and the romantic drama An Officer and a Gentleman (1982) (co-starring Debra Winger) cemented Gere's ascent to stardom, grossing almost $130 million[9] and winning two Academy Awards out of six nominations;[10] Gere himself received his first Golden Globe Award nomination.[11]  For the remainder of the 1980s, Gere appeared in films of varying critical and commercial reception.[12][13] His career rebounded with the releases of Internal Affairs (1990) and Pretty Woman (1990), the latter of which earned him his second Golden Globe Award nomination.[14] The 1990s saw Gere star in successful films including Sommersby (1993) (opposite Jodie Foster), Primal Fear (1996) and Runaway Bride (1999) (which reunited him with his Pretty Woman co-star Julia Roberts).[12] He also took a leading role in the action thriller The Jackal (1997), playing former IRA militant Declan Mulqueen; Gere affected an Irish accent for the role.[15]  Gere was named People magazine's ""Sexiest Man Alive"" in 1999.

"Who Is Prince Michael Jackson II?  Prince Michael ""Blanket"" Jackson is the third and youngest child of the late Michael Jackson. In 2015 he changed his name to Bigi Jackson. The identity of Prince's biological mother — a surrogate — is unknown.  Jackson was seven years old when his father died on June 25, 2009. He attends private school in California and is under the supervision of older cousin T.J. Jackson.  Prince Michael Jackson II’s Mother  The identity of Jackson’s biological mother, a surrogate, is unknown. He is the third child of pop legend Michael Jackson and allegedly the only biological child of the pop star, but no confirmation has ever been made.  Debbie Rowe, the mother of Michael's other two children — Paris Michael Katherine and Michael Joseph ""Prince"" Jackson — publicly denied being Blanket's biological mother, following his birth and subsequent media speculation regarding his conception.  Prince Michael Jackson attends the Mr. Pink Ginseng Drink launch party at Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel on October 11, 2012, in Beverly Hills, California. Photo: Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic  Father’s Death  On June 25, 2009, Jackson's father, Michael, suffered cardiac arrest at his home in Los Angeles and died shortly thereafter. The pop star was 50 years old at the time of his death; Prince Michael Jackson II was seven.  Jackson's grandmother, Katherine Jackson, became his legal guardian, as well as the guardian of his siblings, Michael and Paris.  The three kids spoke to their father's fans during his funeral in 2009, and again in January 2010, accepting a posthumous Lifetime Achievement Award for Michael Jackson at the Grammy Awards.  In February 2010, an official coroner's report on Michael's death was released, revealing that the singer had died from acute propofol intoxication. Aided by his personal physician, Dr. Conrad Murray, Michael had used the drug, among others, to help him sleep.  A police investigation revealed later that Murray hadn't been licensed to prescribe most controlled medications in California, and the doctor's actions as Michael's caretaker were subsequently further scrutinized. Murray was found guilty of homicide on November 7, 2011, receiving a four-year prison sentence.  Wrongful Death Lawsuit  Believing that A.E.G. Live — the entertainment company that promoted Michael Jackson's planned comeback concert, This Is It, in 2009 — had failed to effectively protect the singer while he was under Dr. Conrad Murray's care, the Jackson family decided to take legal action against the company. Katherine Jackson and Michael's three children officially filed a wrongful death lawsuit against A.E.G.  The trial began in April 2013. Lawyers sought up to $1.5 billion, an estimation of what Michael could have earned over the months since his death if he were still alive, in the case.  In October 2013, a jury determined that A.E.G. wasn't responsible for Michael's death. ""Although Michael Jackson's death was a terrible tragedy, it was not a tragedy of A.E.G. Live's making,"" said Marvin S. Putnam, A.E.G.'s lawyer.  Blanket’s Name Change to Bigi  In 2015, several reports surfaced that Jackson no longer wished to be called by his nickname, ""Blanket."" Radar Online claimed that the young teen now wanted to be addressed as ""Bigi."" He took the name after being bullied for years for his ""Blanket"" moniker.  Bigi Jackson Today  Jackson lives in Calabasas, California. He attends the Buckley School, a private school in Sherman Oaks, California. Due to his grandmother's advanced age, along with siblings Michael and Paris leaving the nest as young adults, Jackson is now under the supervision of older cousin T.J. Jackson.  While sources told People magazine that he had the hardest time of his siblings adjusting after his father’s death, he is now doing well, focusing on grades and sports and spending time with his more than 30 cousins.  Among Michael's kids, Bigi has generally stayed out of the spotlight. However, he made a rare appea"	1

"Share Tweet  Former celebrity couple Rihanna and Drake bumped into each other at a child's birthday party in Los Angles and things got awkward.  In a now deleted Snapchat, RiRi is seen walking around the party, playing with the kids in a ball pit and laughing with friends. Drake was also caught on video hanging out and enjoying the day. The one thing that didn't happen is any interaction between the two – publicly at least. To be honest, we're not totally surprised. What would YOU do if you ran into an ex at an intimate gathering? Probably the same thing these two did and that is avoid each other at all costs.  RELATED: Drake Admits That He Still Loves Rihanna  The Shade Room posted a few seconds of the footage with the caption, ""#PressPlay #Rihanna and #Drake were spotted at a kids party today! They arrived separately, Riri came with her bestie. Drake looks like he was caught off guard 😩😂.""  A post shared by The Shade Room (@theshaderoom) on Apr 9, 2017 at 5:55pm PDT  Rihanna and Drake have known each other for a long time and he's professed his love for the songstress more than once. Most notably at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards when the ""One Dance"" singer presented Rihanna with the Video Vanguard Award. There was speculation that these two were dating at the time. After the show, they were seen getting dinner alone.  However, things reportedly fizzled out and no one really knows what went down between them. In August, a source told E! News, ""Rihanna and Drake are seeing other people at the moment. They are not exclusive anymore. They still love each other, but their schedules have gotten in the way. Anything can change between them though, for better or worse. They are still in each other's lives.""  RELATED: Drake Reveals the Most Unexpected Birthday Surprise  Since then, Drake has been romantically linked to India Love and Jennifer Lopez while Rihanna has stayed publicly single. Clearly, things have changed between them considering how little time they spent together at the birthday bash.  No one is quite sure what their status is and if they even acknowledged each other at the gathering. However, we do know that these two are just living their lives exactly like they want at the moment. Both focusing on their careers, friends and family. Because there is so much history between them, we have a feeling these two will be seen hanging out together sooner rather than later. But this birthday party definitely wasn't the place to do that.

Photo-Illustration: Maya Robinson/Vulture and Netflix  The House of Cards writers were in the middle of crafting the final chapters of the show’s operatic showdown between President Claire Underwood and her estranged husband, former President Frank Underwood, when their real world collapsed. Co-showrunners Melissa James Gibson, Frank Pugliese, and the show’s five writers had been convening at their New York office since June 2017. They had finished writing 9 episodes and outlined 11 out of the 13 overall. While they hadn’t figured out how exactly the epic power battle between Claire (Robin Wright) and Frank (Kevin Spacey) would conclude, they were close. About 200 miles away in Baltimore, the first two episodes of the final season had been filmed. A powerful woman was the leader of the free world, and though it was fictional, there was a heightened energy on set because of it.  The writers were still debating one crucial detail — which Underwood would be left standing at the end of the season? — when rape and sexual assault allegations against Harvey Weinstein broke in the New York Times and The New Yorker in October. As news alerts buzzed on their phones daily, the writers wondered what other high-profile figure would tumble next. Three weeks later, BuzzFeed broke the news that Star Trek Discovery actor Anthony Rapp had accused Spacey of making unwanted sexual advances toward him in 1986, when Rapp was 14. The stunned writers, accustomed to working in isolation, were aware of every painful development in the news. “It was very surreal because, at the time, it was the very beginning of the #MeToo movement which was influencing our story and [within it,] what it was like to be president and female,” story editor Sharon Hoffman said. “Writers’ rooms are usually very insular; it’s an intimate, familial place in the best circumstances. But the bubble was broken.”  In less than a week’s time, more than a dozen men had accused Spacey, the two-time Oscar winner, of sexual assault, sexual harassment, and attempted rape. Netflix halted production on the series immediately. By November 3, the streaming giant cut all ties with Spacey, and the future of Netflix’s signature drama was in limbo. Supervising producer-writer Jerome Hairston described working in a “fugue state.” Story editor Tian Jun Gu, who started out on the show as a writer’s assistant in the third season, remembers how rattled the group was by the uncertainty, and how angered they felt by the notion that one man’s actions could topple the show and erase their hard work. It was a “gut punch,” Pugliese said, but the prospect of tossing out five months of work and having to rebuild the season without the show’s corrupt central figure actually emboldened him and his partner. “It felt so unfair to the story, in a way, we had to defend the world of the show,” Gibson said. Wright, who is also an executive producer on the show, agreed. “It was very important to all of us to keep the show going,” she said. “For the fans. To close out the story in full, the way we had always intended.”  The fifth season had ended with Claire’s total rejection of Frank and her declaration to viewers: “My turn.” For months, the story the writers were building around Claire was that of a female president confronting misogyny head-on and enduring hit after hit from the patriarchy, including death threats. Gibson thought it would be especially “perverse” for the story of a woman in power to be denied because of the actions of a man. “On a meta level, it just didn’t seem right to let things happening outside the show […] end the series that way,” Pugliese said.  Co-executive producer Jason Horwitch had traveled to Los Angeles for his wife’s birthday the weekend that Rapp’s accusations were published. Horwitch was preparing to leave for the Baltimore set for production on the third episode, which he had written, when Gibson called him and said, “Don’t get on the plane.” He knew what that meant.

    Don’t mess with this mama. Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi clapped back at mommy-shamers in an Instagram post on Saturday, May 13.  The trouble appears to have started earlier in the day, when the Jersey Shore alum, 29, posted a photo that showed her putting makeup on her 2-year-old daughter, Giovanna.  Getting sissy ready for her dance recital. This is the best Mother’s Day gift to me! ?? #mommysgirl #minime @essexdanceacademy A post shared by Nicole “Snooki” Polizzi (@snooki) on May 13, 2017 at 7:16am PDT  “Getting ready for her dance recital,” Polizzi — who also has a son, Lorenzo, 4, with husband Jionni LaValle — captioned the pic that showed her applying mascara to her toddler’s lashes. “This is the best Mother’s Day gift to me! #mommysgirl #minime.”  While a lot of commenters wrote that it was a cute pic and reminisced about getting their own daughters and granddaughters ready for dance recitals, some criticized the reality TV star for putting makeup on the little girl. “Mothers should be able to post a photo of their child and not be criticized,” one fan wrote in defense of the mother of two. “There is NO harm done here. She is a great mother and loves her children.”  An hour later, Polizzi posted another sweet pic with her daughter, who was wearing a pink tutu with black-and-white polka-dot trim.  “So proud of my little girl!” she wrote, “(instead of not posting my kids for the people who respect and appreciate their photos , I will turn off the comments section. I don’t need a–holes telling me how to raise my child and judge them. I’m a damn good mom and know what I’m doing. Well most of the time.) Happy Mother’s Day to all you kick ass Mamas out there!”	1
    Rachel Bilson stepped out in L.A. on Wednesday, September 20, one day after Us Weekly exclusively confirmed that she and Hayden Christensen have split.  The Nashville actress, 36, was spotted shopping at Sweet Williams children’s clothing store. She wore blue jeans, a black and white patterned blouse and carried a black messenger bag.  Us broke the news that Bilson and Christensen, 36, “have been on the outs for a couple of months.” The pair, who are parents of daughter Briar, 2, met on set of the 2008 film Jumper and got engaged that December. They called off their engagement in 2010, but reconciled shortly after.  “They are completely, officially done,” the source added to Us. “She’s full-time back in L.A. He’s in Toronto.”  Last month, the O.C. alum opened up about possibly having a second child with the Star Wars actor. “I may have another child, that’s still up in the air,” she told Lapalme Magazine’s Summer Issue at the time. “I’m having so much fun with the one right now. I want to be happy and content. All the life BS that happens doesn’t matter. You want to be happy, you want your kid to be happy and you want everyone in your life to be healthy and happy.”  The O.C. Cast: Then and Now    She added of working with Christensen: “[Jumper] was an amazing experience. It was the most precious time. We were shooting in Italy and inside the Coliseum…The role was fulfilling, but also everything was fulfilling as a life experience, it was one of the best times. I think anytime you’re on location you feel like you’re away at summer camp in a way. You’re more open and receptive to life experiences than you are at home.”	1

"Damon Wayans, left, and Clayne Crawford in ""Lethal Weapon"" on Fox. Jordin Althaus/FOX  Lethal Weapon (8 p.m., Fox) — In the Season 2 finale, the squad is on high alert after an apparent threat is made on Riggs’ life. And based on behind-the-scenes reports, that threat could be for real. Apparently Clayne Crawford (who plays Martin Riggs on the show and who was also excellent on Sundance Channel’s “Rectify”) has been pretty awful to deal with on the set. Deadline reports that his behavior has escalated to the point that other actors and crew members don’t want to be on set with him, and it has put the future of the highly rated Fox show in jeopardy. That’s a real shame because this is an excellent show. Get it together, Riggs. (UPDATE: TV Line is reporting now that ""Lethal Weapon"" will likely recast Crawford for Season 3.)  The Voice (8 p.m., NBC) — It’s elimination night, which means someone goes home and we’ll be down to the Top 9 by the end of the show.

"The president and first lady attended a state dinner at Blenheim Palace in Oxfordshire, England, on Thursday, and Melania Trump's formal dress left her looking like a picture-perfect princess — but not the British royal variety.

Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)  Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)  David Hasselhoff‘s financial crisis continues.  The former “Baywatch” star can no longer afford the $21,000-per-month alimony payments to ex-wife Pamela Bach as he claims less than $4,000 to his name, according to TMZ. Hasselhoff, 63, who filed court documents last month to cut off the payments, has shelled out $2.3 million to his former spouse since their divorce in 2006.  Bach, 52, receives $252,000 per year from Hasselhoff, but the singer/actor only grosses $112,000 a month. Though Hasselhoff spends $66,000 of it, with living expenses, taxes and Bach’s payments, he has minimal funds to save. And while a court hearing has been set for the end of May, Hasselhoff isn’t sure if his current endeavors will be enough to salvage the payments.  Hasselhoff’s European tour was cut short due to poor ticket sales, and he’s reportedly unsure if his new reality show, “Hoff the Record,” will find the same success as his previous small-screen endeavors.  While the documents obtained by the website noted that Hasselhoff’s assets, including real estate, cars, jewelry and retirement savings, among others, total $1.79 million, the cash flow is drying up.  Though Bach’s team alleges that Hasselhoff’s net worth is more than $120 million, the newly engaged star has already nixed retirement plans to stay afloat.  “I am 63 years of age, and am at an age when I should be preparing for retirement and not having to continue working in order to pay [Bach’s] support,” Hasselhoff said in papers filed in April.  Though he is set to make an appearance in next year’s “Baywatch” reboot, it’s unclear if that paycheck will ease his stress. In addition to Bach’s payments, as well as his own expenses, Hasselhoff is responsible for daughters Hayley, 23, and TaylorAnn, 25, who live under his roof.  A rep for Hasselhoff did not immediately return our request for comment.	0

"James Van Der Beek won't let a learning disorder prevent his dreams from becoming a reality.  It's no secret that the actor has found huge success in and out of Hollywood after starring in Dawson's Creek, Mercy and more hit projects. But what some fans may not know is that the proud dad and husband is also dyslexic.

In the process, he may have inspired a whole lot of fans with his personal story.  ""You'd think that words wouldn't really be my thing and yet, they are.

She’s an actress, a supermodel and a new mom, but Rosie Huntington-Whiteley says it doesn’t matter if you’re working on the Victoria’s Secret runway or in accounts payable: Balancing motherhood and work is never going to be perfect.  “For every woman, it’s a juggle. You start a family and it’s like, ‘Wow!’ Becoming a mother has been the most humbling experience of my life,” she told Harper's Bazaar Arabia. “When you have a baby, your whole life changes. Your priorities and what’s important is different to before.”  Huntington-Whiteley and actor Jason Statham welcomed their son Jack 10 months ago, and while the new mama did take a maternity leave, she’s now back at it. “I tried to take the time at home to enjoy those first special months with my family,” Huntington-Whiteley explains, adding that coming back to work was a bit of a reality check and has involved some tough decisions.  FEATURED VIDEO ALL OUR VIDEOS  As an actress and model, she considers herself (like many entrepreneurial moms) to be ‘self-employed,’ and says, “You never know when your last job is going to be. You always feel like the phone could stop ringing, and that is where a lot of my drive comes from.”  ð© A post shared by Rosie HW (@rosiehw) on Jan 12, 2018 at 6:31am PST  That’s why her first instinct is to say yes to opportunities, but when she became a mom another instinct took over. “The first thing in your mind before accepting a job is, what’s right for my family? Whereas before, I’d get on a plane anywhere,” she says. “The new thing is getting used to having a lot of responsibilities in my personal life and career.”  Becoming a mom sometimes feels like you’re being pulled in multiple directions. You want to get on that plane, or take on a big project at work, but you miss your little one and want to be with them too.  For Huntington-Whiteley, part of motherhood is understanding that “you can’t just wear one hat in life,” but also not obsessing over the idea of perfect balance at all times. “Work, for me, is my passion,” she says, “I don’t think there’s any such thing as balance. Something is always compromised.”  Huntington-Whiteley’s comments are part of a growing trend of moms rejecting the idea of work-life balance and embracing the chaos instead of chasing perfection.  Recognizing that she can’t be everything to everyone all the time while still pursuing the career she’s proud of and has worked hard to establish is what works for this new mama, who says she wants Jack to grow up knowing that she is more than just his mom—she’s got her own identity and goals, too.  Research indicates that what she’s doing will be good for Jack. Boys raised by working mothers are more likely to grow up to be men who spend time taking care of family members and doing chores around the house, according to Harvard researchers.  By continuing to “keep on the grind, keep working hard,” Huntington-Whiteley is modeling a passion that will serve Jack in the future and is serving her whole family in the present—even if that means making some tough decisions and missing her baby some days.  “You can’t have it all,” she says. “You can’t be 100% all the time to everybody. Maybe when you accept that, that’s the best.”  Well said, Rosie. ?  You might also like:	1
"Johnny Depp and Amber Heard Avoid Awkward Encounter During 2018 SDCC  Email Print Whatsapp Menu Whatsapp Google Reddit Digg Stumbleupon Linkedin  Estranged couple Johnny Depp and Amber Heard managed to avoid a very awkward situation at this year's San Diego Comic-Con.  On Saturday, Depp surprised the attendees of the annual entertainment and pop culture convention to be part of the panel for his upcoming film, the ""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald"" at the Hall H of the San Diego Comic Con. He arrived wearing his costume for his character, the titular villain named Gellert Grindelwald.

""I saw Amber down by the loading dock and she was talking to some security guards before her panel,"" one of the eyewitness said. ""Didn't see her and Johnny in the same place but Johnny did come out to the dock to smoke a cigarette before his panel. He was there about 20 to 30 minutes before I saw Amber.""  Another eyewitness claimed that Depp left in a whit car and the two were never in the same place at once. ""It was a close call backstage though, but Johnny was done on stage before Amber got to that backstage area,"" the second source also said.  The ex-couple's disastrous relationship had been revealed after Heard filed for divorce in May 2016 after more than a year of marriage. She accused him of physically and verbally abusing her. She also filed a restraining order against him a week before she filed for divorce.

    Nick Lachey isn’t ashamed of his boy band past and still pokes fun at himself every now and again.  The singer, 43, took to Instagram to give a shout-out to his infamous “sun” tattoo, which sits on his bicep above his tribal tat, that he got back in the ‘90s at the height of 98 Degrees’ success.  These days the ink looks a little different and no longer has the band’s name in the middle of the sun.

Hell if I know, but it sure is sunny…,” the meme reads, featuring a side-by-side shot of his tat then and now.  The TV host captioned the shot on Instagram, “Today’s forecast…”  Meanwhile, the quartet of guys, also comprised of Lachey’s brother Drew, Justin Jeffre and Jeff Timmons, are gearing up to release a new Christmas album titled Let It Snow on October 13, their first new album in four years and a 18-year-later follow-up to their platinum certified album This Christmas.

In Touch's explosive report claims that both Jen and Justin are incredibly hurt by their split, and the resentment is only growing as details of their troubled two-and-a-half year married leaks to the world.  'Both sides want their version of the truth out there,' a source who claims to know both parties tells In Touch. 'So it's getting nasty.'  The insider adds, 'While they're pretending they're still friends, they are clashing behind the scenes.'  Getty  Tensions between the couple began to mount when Justin accused Jen's Hollywood friends of leaking stories about the high-profile couple, In Touch's sensational report claims.  'Justin definitely thinks Jen's Hollywood friends are leaking stories to the media to make him look like he's the bad guy,' a source tells the publication. 'Meanwhile, Jen and her pals are positive that Justin's friends are doing the same.'  In Touch further reports that the couple's inner circle have been forced to pick sides, leaving their friends torn and frustrated.  A friend of the couple's tells the publication that Courtney Cox, Jason Bateman and his wife Amanda Anka are firmly 'Team Jen', while Ben Stiller and Paul Rudd have aligned themselves with Justin.  This source of tension has made matters worse between the pair, with an insider revealing to In Touch, 'There is just so much animosity between them.'  Star magazine has also reported that Justin was sick of Jen's lavish lifestyle.  An insider close to the actor reveals that he is 'totally done pretending to be someone he's not and honestly feels relieved.'  The magazine details how Jen and Justin's inability to find a balance between their careers and personalities ultimately led the pair's relationship to crumble.  'Justin always felt like he was the one doing all the compromising, and realised that he was creating a future he didn't actually want,' a friend tells Star. 'Now, finally, he's taking some time for himself, reconnecting with old friends and getting back to the way things were.'  Neither Jen or Justin have responded to In Touch or Star's reports.	0

This is why Chrissy Teigen has 18.9 million followers on Instagram.  Not only does she have an adorable family, a down-to-earth attitude, and a sense of humor, but she also makes a real effort with her posts. On Monday, she shared a gem: a parody of the opening credits of the cheesy, long-running TV rom-com The Love Boat intermixed with scenes and characters from the Bravo reality series Below Deck. This version, called Love Boat: Malibu, starring none other than the model herself, her husband John Legend, and their friends on a yacht.  As Legend’s version of the Love Boat theme song plays in the background, he appears as the captain. Cookbook author Teigen situates herself in the kitchen, where she fills the ship’s position as “chief stew,” or stewardess. Everyone aboard hilariously poses for the camera as their name flashes on the screen, just like actors often did for seemingly every TV show in the ’80s. Some of them imitate the Bravo fan favorite, like when celeb stylist Jen Atkin pretends to get sick over the side of the boat as a nod to the seasick cast member — make that mate — Kasey, on Below Deck Mediterranean.  Teigen joked about the ridiculousness of the clip, but her followers approved.  by far the dumbest thing we have ever done — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) July 16, 2018  we are such losers pic.twitter.com/liNRIpPnBr — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) July 16, 2018  John and I are pretending to be on “below deck” aka one of the best shows on television pic.twitter.com/KAOr206YS5 — christine teigen (@chrissyteigen) July 15, 2018  No word yet on when the spinoff will hit Instagram.

"Good news: Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani are still going strong in the relationship department!  The not-as-good-news: They're kinda over all of the attention their burgeoning love affair has brought them.  The pair met in 2015 as coaches on ""The Voice,"" and have provided fans with a behind-the-scenes look at their lives, including some hilarious birthday party moments, ever since. But they're sort of hoping that this season things quiet down a little.  Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani on ""The Voice."" NBC  RELATED: Gwen Stefani wishes Blake Shelton happy birthday with childhood pics  Trending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service  When TODAY's Carson Daly wondered on Monday if things have calmed at all, Shelton told him, ""God, I hope so!""  But he's pretty sure it is more normalized now. ""I don't think it's mellowed out, really,"" Shelton continued. ""I think we don't pay as much attention anymore. We're numb to it.""  What's amusing to Shelton are the extremes fans have gone to when speculating about the relationship: ""Any time you see a story about us, it's either that it's a fake relationship or that we're already married. Or we're gonna get married, or she's on her second set of twins. Or, you know, I'm sneaking behind her back to eat meat. I eat meat right in front of her face!"" (Stefani is a longtime vegan.)  ""Every single one of those things is true,"" quipped fellow ""Voice"" coach Adam Levine, who was there for the interview with Stefani and coach Alicia Keys.  RELATED: Carson Daly comments on Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani romance: 'I didn't know'  ""In people's defense, I think it's so hard for people to wrap their head around why Gwen would want to be with me,"" said Shelton. ""I don't blame 'em.""  ""You're crazy, you're crazy!"" said Stefani.  Crazy in love, that is!  ""The Voice"" airs on NBC Mondays and Tuesdays at 8 p.m. ET.  Follow Randee Dawn on Twitter."	0
"On April 23, 2016, Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band paid tribute to Prince, who died just two days earlier, by opening his show with a version of ""Purple Rain."" It was the third time in as many months that the group has honored a colleague who had recently died. On the first two nights of their 2016 tour, they covered songs by the late David Bowie and Glenn Frey.  It struck us that, since he's been doing this since the early '70s, Springsteen has often been on the road when a friend or influence has passed. We poured over set lists from previous tours and found several examples where Springsteen has referenced another musician's death from the stage, either at the beginning of the concert or the at the start of the encore. In addition to the three mentioned above, we discovered that Springsteen has performed post-mortem covers of two giants of 20th century American music -- country icon Johnny Cash and folk legend Pete Seeger -- as well songs by Joe Strummer, George Harrison, Brill Building songwriter Ellie Greenwich, Warren Zevon and, in the earliest clip we could find, John Lennon.  But the most poignant tributes came when two founding members of the E Street Band -- keyboardist Danny Federici and Clarence Clemons -- died. In both cases, Springsteen dedicated entire tours as an opportunity to allow himself, his band and the audience to come together and mourn the loss of friends and bandmates.  As one of the most bootlegged artists in rock history, Springsteen's acts of respect have made their way to YouTube. We've gathered them here, so take a look below at how he has musically eulogized some of those he loved and admired."	0
Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have three children together and recently celebrated their fourth wedding anniversary. However, a new report claims that the couple known as “Kimye” have been faking their marriage for the public.  According to a report by Gossip Cop, one tabloid claims to have sources that reveal Kim Kardashian and Kanye West have a “secret pact” to continue their relationship for the sake of their reputation, although they don’t really want to stay married to each other.  The outlet reveals that Woman’s Day in New Zealand claims that there is a “lack of love” between Kim and Kanye, despite their marriage and family. The pair have allegedly been faking their relationship “for the sake of their brand and their three children,” a source allegedly told the outlet.  “Kim knows she needs Kanye and says they very much have a business relationship, which she’s hell-bent on continuing,” the magazine reports a Kardashian insider as saying.  However, Gossip Cop claims that rumors simply are not true, and that more credible sources at People Magazine claim that Kim is a “very loyal wife” to Kanye, and recently very publicly defended him when many were questioning his mental heath due to a series of tweets he posted about the state of the country.  Wyoming A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on May 27, 2018 at 12:21pm PDT  Loading...  As previously reported by the Inquisitr, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West recently spent the Fourth of July together with their family in Idaho. The couple were reportedly looking to get some peace and quiet in the town of Coeur d’Alene, which has been a frequent celebrity hot spot, boasting recent guests such as Harry Styles, Wayne Gretzky, and Adam Levine.  The couple rented a $1.85 million cabin with four bedrooms, 4.5 bathrooms, and an amazing view of the water for their holiday getaway. Kim even took to her Instagram account to reveal that she and her friends were on a boat and gearing up to try wakeboarding for the first time, an activity that Kardashian later called harder than it looks.  However, Kim Kardashian did not show off Kanye West on her social media account, only further debunking that she and the rapper have a pact to put on a fake marriage for the cameras. If anything, they are often the subject of divorce rumors due to comments made by West or the amount of time they go without being seen together in public.  Most recently, the couple stepped out for a dinner date at Nobu in Malibu, and even rocked matching looks by wearing similar cargo pants and muted tones from Kanye’s Yeezy clothing line.	0

"Are you ready for a new pair of boots?  While out during Paris Fashion Week, Karlie Kloss was spotted wearing the same pair of shoes on at least two different occasions—a known fashion faux pas, especially for a top model. Yet, according to the model, the Fabiola Button Boot from Christian Louboutin were worth being considered a ""repeat offender,"" especially when paired with a mid-length dress and leather trench coat.  While over-the-knee boots continue to reign celebrity street style, the buttons with elastic fasteners and high heels add an interesting twist to the popular look. The old world feel of the details make them ideal for minimalist and utilitarian looks, while the height gives them a sultry appeal. Although her exact boots are sold out, you may want to consider adding the look to your wardrobe."	1
Rachel Brosnahan returned to the red carpet for the Tony Awards on Sunday, June 10, days after her aunt Kate Spade died at the age of 55.  The Marvelous Miss Maisel actress, 27, stepped out in a pink floral Dolce & Gabbana gown for the star-studded event at Radio City Music Hall in NYC. After posing for photos, she’d later introduce the performance of The Band’s Visit.  Spade died by suicide on June 5. She was found dead in her New York City apartment at about 10:20 a.m. by her housekeeper. Brosnahan’s father is the brother of the late designer.  11 PHOTOS Rachel Brosnahan at the 2018 Tony Awards See Gallery Rachel Brosnahan at the 2018 Tony Awards NEW YORK, NY - JUNE 10: Rachel Brosnahan attends the 72nd Annual Tony Awards at Radio City Music Hall on June 10, 2018 in New York City.

She was the kindest person I’ve ever known and my best friend for 35 years. My daughter and I are devastated by her loss, and can’t even begin to fathom life without her. We are deeply heartbroken and miss her already,” he said in a statement. “Kate suffered from depression and anxiety for many. She was actively seeking help and working closely with her doctors to treat her disease, one that takes far too many lives. We were in touch with her the night before and she sounded happy.”  He continued: “There was no indication and no warning that she would do this. It was a complete shock. And it clearly wasn’t her. There were personal demons she was battling.”  The pair, who married in 1994, are the parents of daughter Frances Beatrix, now 13. They were separated at the time of Kate’s death.

"Starbucks fans now have something to look forward to this Halloween.  The coffee chain is releasing the Vampire Frappuccino.  The drink includes layers of mocha sauce, mocha frappe, and strawberry puree to create the bloody effect.  The only catch is that it hasn't been spotted in the US... for now.  Starbucks has fall drinks on lock, with the forever-famous PSL and Maple Pecan Latte gracing our timelines this month. While delicious, those lattes aren't quite as eye-catching as the Unicorn Frappe, the neon concoction of the spring.  Never fear, Starbs isn't letting a season go by without giving you something to 'gram. Halloween's creepiest drink, the Vampire Frappuccino, is officially back in at least four countries. Sadly, the bloody-looking treat hasn't been spotted in the U.S. yet, but the U.K., Singapore, Norway and Sweden all have it in stores, E! Online reports.  In case you need a refresher, the drink starts with mocha sauce, then layers a mocha frappe with strawberry puree to create a blood effect. Most also have whipped cream and more ""blood"" drizzled on top.  Singapore's stores are offering two slightly different versions this year: Mr. and Mrs. Vampire Frappuccino. The Mr. version has chocolatey cereal layered on top, while the Mrs. has a pump of vanilla syrup added.  For the first time ever, Mr and Mrs #VampireFrappuccino makes a special daytime appearance. 🎃 Click link in bio for more info. A post shared by Starbucks Singapore (@starbuckssg) on Oct 4, 2017 at 8:58pm PDT Oct 4, 2017 at 8:58pm PDT  There's still plenty of time for the U.S. to catch up, though. Last year, American Starbucks' locations brought back the Frappula a few days before Halloween, but only for a few days. And since the ingredients are available year round, you can technically order it any time you want. Just ask nicely, or the barista's fangs might come out."	1
"These two are just friends. MTV The INSIDER Summary:  Tom Holland and Zendaya are costars in ""Spider-Man: Homecoming.""  People published a report that the two were dating in real life.  They both took to social media to shut the rumors down.  The two are just friends.    Zendaya and Tom Holland can't seem to escape the romance rumors, but these ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" stars are not dating.  People magazine published a report Thursday evening citing a source who told them that the potential couple started dating while filming the newest Marvel movie.  “They started seeing each other while they were filming 'Spider-Man,'"" said the magazine's source.""They’ve been super careful to keep it private and out of the public eye but they’ve gone on vacations with each other and try and spend as much time as possible with one another.""  Zendaya, 20, who plays Michelle in the movie, responded to the rumors on Twitter and shut them down.  ""Wait wait...my favorite is when it says we go on vacations together HA! I haven't been on vacation in years! hbu [how about you] @TomHolland1996?"" she tweeted.  Holland, 21, who plays Spider-Man, responded with some laughing emojis and joked, ""Does the press tour count?""  Zendaya's final tweet on the romance rumors was, ""I'm done,"" with a crying/laughing emoji and raised hand emoji.  That settles the question of romantic involvement, but it won't stop people from wanting it to be true.  (Note: Minor spoilers for ""Spider-Man: Homecoming"" are below.)  It's unclear whether the two characters will become romantically involved in future movies. Zendaya's character, Michelle, revealed at the end of the film that her nickname is MJ. The moniker is used as the nickname for Mary Jane, Spider-Man's love interest in the comics, so it could happen. Though, it is safe to say after their responses that these two are just friends in real life."	1

Celebrities may live parts of their lives in the spotlight, but many of them still choose to keep certain things private. And when it comes to breakups, there are some celebs who choose to keep a low profile and grieve away from the limelight. There are others, however, who go through breakups so public that it borders on insane.  Here’s a look at 15 messy celebrity splits that were pushed into the spotlight. (The breakup on page 12 was particularly bad.)  1. Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Phillippe  Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Phillippe | Evan Agostini/Getty Images Reese Witherspoon and Ryan Phillippe | Evan Agostini/Getty Images  They were once one of Hollywood’s cutest young couples. But their split in the early 2000s was nasty — especially when it was publicly aired out that Phillippe had been unfaithful. In 2014, Witherspoon vented about it to Us Weekly, blaming the divorce for her career blunders. Yikes!  Next: One of the most talked about breakups in modern Hollywood …  2. Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston  These exes still make tabloid headlines. | Boris Horvat/AFP/Getty Images These exes still make tabloid headlines. | Boris Horvat/AFP/Getty Images  With how the tabloids cover it, you would think that these two celebrities are still going through a breakup! Once it was speculated that Pitt had cheated Aniston with Angelina Jolie — more on them on page 15 — the tabloids had a field day that has yet to end. There have also been multiple “tell-alls” from the Friends actress regarding the divorce.  Next: This divorce was as nasty as they get …  3. Burt Reynolds and Loni Anderson  Burt Reynolds and Loni Anderson in happier times. | YouTube Burt Reynolds and Loni Anderson in happier times. | YouTube  Not only was their divorce incredibly public, but it spanned over a couple decades. Anderson alleged that Reynolds beat her, while the Smokey and the Bandit actor criticized his ex-wife’s penchant for spending money.

Like mother, like son! Fergie and her baby son Axl wear matching bandanas as singer shows off her slender legs in LA    She just can't get enough of her beloved 10-month-old son.    And Fergie is even making sure she coordinates with little Axl, as they had matching bandanas when she was spotted carrying him around Los Angeles on Saturday.    The 39-year-old Black Eyed Peas frontwoman showed off her long slender pins and wore quirky sunglasses for the day out with her baby boy.  Scroll down for video  Cool baby, cool! Fergie wore a quirky pair of goggle-shaped sunglasses when she stepped out in Sherman Oaks, California on Saturday with her 10-month-old baby boy Axl on her hip  Fergie had picked out black and white patterned bandanas, one for her and one for Axl.    His was tied delicately around his neck as a cute bib, whilst hers was slung around her waist over the top of her shorts.    The tiny denim cut-offs featured a frayed edge and put as much skin on show as possible, and she teamed them with a black and white snakeskin print tank.  Matchy matchy: The 39-year-old Black Eyed Peas singer dressed herself and her son in similar black printed bandanas for the outing, with his around his neck as a scarf and hers around her waist  Happy days: The Fergalicious hitmaker showed off her long slender legs as she smiled through the day  A pair of rounded, goggle-style sunglasses stood out on the Fergalicious singer's face from a mile off, adding a touch of quirk to her otherwise mainstream outfit.    A black cowboy had kept Fergie protected from the sun on the hot Californian day, as she hit the pavement in silver studded ankle boots.    The songstress also made the bold move of tapping into the age old trend - which is now returning - of storing one's essentials in a fanny pack around the waist.    Hers was made by Chanel, leaving little room to doubt the fashionability of the item.  Summer style: The star wore a black cowboy hat for sun protection and denim cut-off shorts  Bringing it back into fashion? Fergie even wore a black Chanel fanny pack to carry her goodies  The star's husband Josh Duhamel - to whom she has been married since 2009 - was not spotted with the pair on this outing, but the stud would surely have approved of his wife's hot outfit.    Fergie recently revealed that she likes to dress up for dates with Josh.    She told People: 'He loves me natural all the time, but now because I do natural a lot, he loves when I do a bright red lip. He thinks that’s sexy. I’ve noticed that he really likes that.'	0

Justin Bieber and his mom, Pattie Mallette, were in a tropical vacay in the Maldives. Even if she broke her leg there, she didn’t let this misfortunate event ruin her time with her beloved son.  This vacation seemed to be a great one judging by the pics posted by Pattie on her social media account.  The only downside was the fact that Pattie managed to break her leg on the very first day of her vacation and it seems that she had an adventure in order to be able to seek medical care there.  Yesterday morning, on January 20, Justin fans were freaked out when he posted a picture of him and his mom who was in a wheelchair.  A post shared by Justin Bieber (@justinbieber) on Jan 20, 2018 at 4:11am PST  After Justin’s post, Pattie also posted a pic of her broken foot on her social media account and she made sure to explain to her 1.9 million fans what exactly had happened there.  ‘Okay so yeah, I broke my foot on the first day of vacation 🙁 but there are worse places to be hurt ;). Of that I am sure…’ she posted.  Despite the injury, the upbeat mom continued, ‘Almost all I got are foot pics lol! I had to take a few boats and seaplanes to get it looked at / treated, but I had awesome helpers and a cool wheelchair made for sand. My foot has been on an adventure this trip! #blessed’  She posted more pics some of them showing luxurious baths, and she explained to her fans that these baths were helping her with the pain and all the discomfort.  Before breaking her leg, Pattie also posted a photo of her and her son, and she captioned it saying that she is proud of her young man and of what he became.  Advertisement  She wrote that he is maturing beautifully and wise. Let’s just hope that he’ll manage to make Selena Gomez’s mom see him the way his own mother does if he is indeed a changed young man.	1
Billie Lourd has remembered her late mother Carrie Fisher in honor of Mother's Day on Sunday.  The 25-year-old actress was struck by a double tragedy in 2016 when her Fisher passed away on December 27, followed by her grandmother Debbie Reynolds a day later, and in a touching tribute on Instagram, the star has reached out to anyone having a 'less than perfect' mother's day.  Alongside a picture of herself hugging the Star Wars actress, Billie wrote: 'This one goes out to anyone having a less than perfect Mother's Day today. We are not alone. Sending all my love and strength to anyone who needs it. (sic)'  Love: Billie Lourd has remembered her late mother Carrie Fisher in honor of Mother's Day on Sunday  Billie's touching comments come after she previously spoke on The Ellen DeGeneres Show about how the death of her mother, as well as her grandmother, has been 'impossible to deal with'.  She said: 'Yeah, it's completely surreal. There's no way to really explain it. It's so hard to talk about. I don't know, if I say that I'm doing good, I'm too happy. And if I say that I'm not doing good, then I'm a mess.  So it's really hard to know what to say about it because it is just so surreal and impossible to deal with.'  Tragedy: The 25-year-old actress was struck by tragedy in 2016 when her Fisher passed away on December 27. The pair seen here in 2015  Meanwhile, Carrie's brother Todd previously told ET his niece was staying strong in the wake of the family's terrible losses.  He said: 'Billie is 24-years-old. She's dealing with two gigantic losses. These two girls - my girls, my mother and my sister, were big, big personalities [with a] big influence on Billie, myself, many people. There's a vacuum in the room and she's feeling it and we're all feeling it. It's just that I'm 59 and I have no choice but to step up and put this stuff forward. I'm letting [Billie] breathe, you know? She needs to breathe. She needs to step back from all of this loss.  'When I was standing in the room the day after my sister died and we're in the hospital and my mother was dying, I mean, I was more heartbroken watching my niece than I was for myself. It was heart-wrenching. The idea that somebody would have to deal with that kind of a loss back to back, moment to moment - I mean we'd just had this horrible loss and then here you are just a handful of hours later standing in a different hospital in a different room. It was astounding.'	1
George & Amal Clooney welcomed twins Ella & Alexander just 3 months ago, but a new report claims the stars could ALREADY be expecting baby #3! Apparently Amal’s showing pregnancy signs, & it may even be twins again!  A third child already? George, 56, and Amal Clooney‘s, 39, friends reportedly believe the star couple are expecting once again, according to Life & Style magazine. And although Amal gave birth to baby twins Ella and Alexander back in June, the two would reportedly be “thrilled” if they were to expand their family once again. “[Amal] has the same symptoms she had when she learned she was pregnant the first time,” an alleged close friend told the magazine. “She’s eating like crazy and is more emotional than normal.” Click here to see pics of Amal’s stunning maternity style.  Her friends apparently believe the human rights lawyer is still in the very early stages of pregnancy, but even weeks from now, there may still be no sign of a bump. “During her first pregnancy, Amal barely showed for the first several months, and was active and working right up until a few weeks before the birth,” the source said. “But she was tired a lot and had trouble getting to a healthy baby weight.” At the same time however, if Amal truly is pregnant, her weight may not be an issue this time around. “Amal’s been loving going out to dinner while the family has been in Italy over the summer,” the insider added. “She’s craving pasta, risotto, and margherita pizza. At times it seems like she could be eating for three!”  And as it turns out, she actually COULD be! “Having twins once does increase your chance of having them again,” Dr. Pari Ghodsi, ob-gyn, shared with the publication. “Older moms are also more likely to have twins.” What’s more, Amal’s sister, Tala, has twins as well, and they tend to run in families. Having three — or four — kids under the age of two would definitely have its challenges, but apparently George “would be thrilled if Amal is indeed pregnant,” the source revealed. “He loves being a dad, and really has a more-the-merrier attitude toward enlarging the family.”  On the other hand though, Amal said in a Sept. 6 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, that she is definitely finished having kids. “I’m 39,” the new mom said with a head shake when asked if she wanted more kids. “I already had them quite late.”  Tell us, HollywoodLifers — do YOU think Amal is pregnant again? Do you think she and George will end up having another kid?	0

FILE PHOTO: U.S. first lady Melania Trump hosts a roundtable discussion with tech leaders on the effects of the - RC153AF40210  WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s wife, Melania Trump, returned to the White House on Saturday after undergoing a surgical procedure this week to treat a benign kidney condition, her office said.  The first lady, 48, had been recovering at Walter Reed medical center since Monday, when she underwent an embolization procedure to treat the kidney condition.  Spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said in a statement that Melania Trump returned to the White House on Saturday morning.  “She is resting comfortably and remains in high spirits,” Grisham said. “Our office has received thousands of calls and emails wishing Mrs. Trump well, and we thank everyone who has taken the time to reach out.”  An embolization is a minimally invasive procedure often used to block the flow of blood to a tumor or an abnormal area of tissue.  Donald Trump tweeted on Saturday that it was “great to have our incredible First Lady back home in the White House.”  In an initial tweet he misspelled her first name, writing that “Melanie is feeling and doing really well,” before writing a subsequent tweet with her name’s correct spelling.	1
"It's been over 10 years since Miley Cyrus debuted as her beloved Disney Channel character Hannah Montana and became a worldwide sensation at just 13 years old. Now, the singer is reflecting on her time on the show, and the lasting impact her childhood stardom has had on her.  “I liked being in the Disney universe ’cause I didn’t know anything else,"" she tells correspondent Anthony Mason in a new interview with CBS Sunday Morning. ""I knew I was getting to live what I wanted to do. I think now that I’m older now, I realize that’s a lot to put on a kid.”  That pressure weighed on Cyrus, who felt like she struggled to balance being a young person and a professional all at once.  “It’s a lot to put on a kid to have them have to get their makeup done and then also balance school and then also have me dress up in a wig. It’s a little Toddlers and Tiaras,"" she says.  READ: Miley Cyrus Finally Feels Like She Has 'Respect': 'I Proved What I Wanted to Do'  But, her memories of her Hannah Montana days aren't all negative.  ""I definitely look back on it as a good time,"" she muses. ""I think what was hard for me was balancing everything. I think it got harder when I started touring as both -- I toured as Hannah Montana and as myself.”  She also jokes that juggling the dueling Hannah/Miley personalities may have impacted her as an adult.  ""I think that’s probably what’s a little bit wrong with me now!” she laughs. “I mark that up to doing some extreme damage in my psyche as an adult person.”  WATCH: Miley Cyrus Shine in Her Duet With Dad Billy Ray on Beautiful Tom Petty Cover!  Still, Hannah is a character that Cyrus still embraces and appreciates for the message it offered her young fans.  ""I loved being that character,"" she admits. ""And honestly, music is everything and all people wanna have is great music and for that audience, for what that was, that was great music for kids to listen to. There’s a song called ‘Life’s What You Make it, so Let’s Make it Rock.’ Never forget that -- wise words. That’s a good thing to tell kids.""  RELATED: Miley Cyrus Reveals How She Got in Trouble on 'The Voice' in New 'Carpool Karaoke'  The singer also acknowledges that moving on from her time as a child star was perhaps tougher for fans than it was for her.  ""America feels like my aunt. ‘You know, you’ve grown up so much and we don’t want to see you grow up,’” Cyrus explains.  The 24-year-old is all grown up now though, and has had a busy 2017, from spending time with her longtime love Liam Hemsworth, to releasing her new album, Younger Now, and appearing on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon and an epic Carpool Karaoke episode with James Corden.

"Kristin Cavallari. Photo: Courtesy  We all buy clothes, but no two people shop the same. It can be a social experience, and a deeply personal one; at times, it can be impulsive and entertaining, at others, purpose-driven, a chore. Where do you shop? When do you shop? How do you decide what you need, how much to spend and what's ""you""? These are some of the questions we're putting to prominent figures in our column ""How I Shop.""  Everyone's favorite drama (""drama, drama, dramaaa"") queen, Kristin Cavallari, is back on TV. It's been over a decade since she slowly walked out of an infinity pool and into our lives on ""Laguna Beach: The Real Orange County,"" and made the bossest of boss moves by being the only one to wear white to Lauren Conrad's ""Black and White Affair"" party. (And who can forget when she, again, stole L.C.'s thunder on spin-off ""The Hills"" by surprise-sauntering into Speidi's wedding in 2009?)  This time around, Cavallari moves into another life via reality TV fishbowl, set not in Southern California, but her new home of Nashville, Tenn. ""Very Cavallari"" showcases the titular star's home life, with NFL quarterback husband Jay Cutler and her three kids, and professional responsibilities running Uncommon James, her recently launched jewelry and lifestyle line, opening its flagship store and overseeing a team of TV-ready staffers at the company HQ. Cavallari has been stacking her fashion resumé since ""The Hills"" by curating a NFL-themed runway show at New York Fashion Week, designing her eponymous shoe line in collaboration with Chinese Laundry, commenting on red carpet fashion for E! and, of course, launching Uncommon James.  ""I design everything that I love and want to wear,"" she tells Fashionista over the phone from Nashville. ""It's a great representation of my style because everything is effortless and dainty and simple.""  Since ""Very Cavallari"" is largely set in a retail and fashion environment, we took the opportunity of its launch to ask the reality show star, designer and entrepreneur about her shopping habits, from her teen years to today. So read on to learn about her first big splurge as a reality star, when she knows a look in her closet is officially ""dunzo"" (sorry, couldn't help it) and how her DGAF attitude toward fashion dates back to her ""Laguna Beach"" days. Cue up the Hilary Duff song and prepare for some on-brand Cavallari one-liners.  Stephen ""Steph-EEEN"" Colletti, Cavallari and Talan ""ta-LAN"" Torriero at a Bongo Jeans at Kohl's Orange County store appearance in 2006. Photo: David Livingston/Getty Images  ""On 'Laguna Beach' — I mean I was 17 — so I didn't care [laughs]. I didn't even know what fashion was. I just wore what everyone in Laguna Beach was wearing and what I liked. I mean I wore jeans first with Ugg boots and I thought that was the coolest thing ever. What was so great about season one of 'Laguna Beach' was none of us knew what we were getting into and so we didn't care. Or I know I didn't care about about my outfits or my hair and my makeup. I was just living my life. I've never been a huge fan of putting a lot of time in everyday to get ready. I really enjoy it when it's once in awhile, but everyday I find it's just exhausting. So I've just always been that way: I care, but not that much.  It's funny in the sense that now people ask 'go back and comment on your outfits from 10 years ago' and it's like, 'oh god.' Of course, they're all awful! It's just the evolution of everybody and what I wore, let's say, when I was 18, was probably cool at that point. But now, of course, looking back, I cringe. There's always going to be that element of, 'let's go back in time and can you comment on this picture,' which most people don't have to do. I don't mind it necessarily. I'm just living my life, and so I'm not really reading blogs and reading comments about what people think about my outfits, so it doesn't affect me one way or the other, really.  I'd say [I found my personal style] in the last"	1

Far far away, behind the word mountains, far from the countries Vokalia and Consonantia, there live the blind texts. Separated they live in Bookmarksgrove right at the coast of the Semantics, a large language ocean. A small river named Duden flows by their place and supplies it with the necessary regelialia. It is a paradisematic country, in which roasted parts of sentences.  One day however a small line of blind text by the name of Lorem Ipsum decided to leave for the far World of Grammar. The Big Oxmox advised her not to do so.  When she reached the first hills of the Italic Mountains  A wonderful serenity has taken possession of my entire soul, like these sweet mornings of spring which I enjoy with my whole heart. I am alone, and feel the charm of existence in this spot, which was created for the bliss of souls like mine. I am so happy, my dear friend, so absorbed in the exquisite.  The whole secret of life is to be interested in one thing profoundly and in a thousand things well  I should be incapable of drawing a single stroke at the present moment; and yet I feel that I never was a greater artist than now. When, while the lovely valley teems with vapour around me, and the meridian sun strikes the upper surface of the impenetrable foliage of my trees, and but a few stray gleams steal into the inner sanctuary, I throw myself down among the tall grass by the trickling stream; and, as I lie close to the earth, a thousand unknown plants are noticed by me.

Jessica Lange is returning to “American Horror Story.”  Sarah Paulson announced that Lange would be in the show’s upcoming eighth season during the TCA summer press tour on Friday, in the role of Constance Langdon.  Lange was a major part of the early seasons of the FX anthology series, appearing in Seasons 1-4. She garnered four Emmy nominations in the process, winning two. She then went on to collaborate with series creator Ryan Murphy in the first season of “Feud,” in which she starred as Joan Crawford.  The news of Lange’s return comes on the heels of FX announcing that “American Horror Story” has also been renewed for a tenth season ahead of the eighth season premiere. The show had previously been renewed for Seasons 8 and 9.  As previously announced, Season 8 of the series, titled “Apocalypse,” will be a crossover between the “American Horror Story” seasons “Murder House” and “Coven,” which were the first and third seasons of the show, respectively. It will debut on Sept. 12.  Murphy has previously said that “American Horror Story” mainstays Sarah Paulson, Evan Peters, and Kathy Bates will lead the eighth season of the series. It was also announced last week that “Assassination of Gianni Versace” breakout Cody Fern would join the show in the role of Michael Langdon.	1
"They make much of being devoted sisters.  But Kim Kardashian didn't hold back when she attacked Kourtney and pregnant Khloe's dress sense during a trip to Japan, calling them 'f***ing clowns'.  In a new clip from Sunday's upcoming episode of Keeping Up With The Kardashians she sat her sisters down and told them: 'So I gotta be real with you guys. You look like f***ing clowns.'  Kim Kardashian tells Kourtney and pregnant Khloe 'you look like f***ing clowns' as she attacks their dress sense in KUWTK  Clowns? Kim attacked her sisters outfits during their Japan trip  'Oh!' replied her sisters, in obvious shock.  Kim was unrepentant. 'I'm not f***ing kidding. This is not like a tourist thing where it's Halloween, dress up like a f***ing Japanese geisha.'  Defending herself, Kourtney said: 'I thought my hair looked good last night and I thought my outfit was fun for Japan.'  Can you believe her? Khloe and Kourtney looked bemused at Kim's remarks  'You can be cooler': Kim didn't hold back when blasting her sisters  But Kim wasn't having it. 'Your outfit would have been great if you didn't have like blue eyeshadow.  'You have to tell the glam people. Everyone just thinks ""Let's go full Japan"" and probably the people that live here make fun of people like that.'  While her sisters had at first smiled at Kim's words, they grimaced as she added: 'I am literally cropping myself out.'  Defensive: Kourtney said she thought she looked fun and cute  On blast: Kourtney hit back at her sister in the video room  Kim then told Kourtney: 'You can be cooler.'  But Kourtney bit back, later telling the camera: 'You think I looked like a clown? well you look like you just won the Tour de France and you're cycling around town.'  Kim then decreed: 'I'm not telling you who to be or what to wear or anything. But I'm telling you who to be and what to wear. It could be time for a fashion overhaul so that you stay young and relevant.'  While Kim's comments may seem mean, she has said far worst in the past.  Indeed in the show's season premiere she labelled Kourtney 'the least exciting to look at' - a biting comment for a family who rely on their looks to make their money.  Keeping Up With The Kardashian is available to stream Mondays on hayu in the UK & Ireland  On blast: Kim had words for her sisters, saying they needed a fashion overhaul; the trio are seen in February"	1

"Today, Jessica Simpson is a business mogul. In 2016, she sold a majority stake in her booming lifestyle brand, the Jessica Simpson Collection, which Forbes reported was then bringing in $1 billion annually, helping the star amass a net worth of $170 million. Before that, she was a pop star with a slew of other successes: Her 2006 album ""A Public Affair"" sold over 100,000 copies in its first week, according to Rolling Stone, and singles like ""These Boots are Made for Walkin'"" and ""Come Over"" were hits. She's appeared in TV shows like MTV's Newlyweds (2003) and movies including ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" (2005) and ""Employee of the Month"" (2006). So it can be easy to forget Simpson was once a struggling artist. But the celebrity entrepreneur and mom hasn't forgotten. Simpson recently shared a moment she felt was pivotal in her career. On Wednesday, Simpson posted on Instagram a 2004 throwback video from ABC's now defunct ""The Nick & Jessica Variety Hour,"" which Simpson hosted with her then-husband, Nick Lachey. In her post, Simpson calls the duet of ""Who Will Save Your Soul"" with the song's original singer, Jewel, ""The moment I felt my career explode.""  The post, which Simpson tagged #WCW (""woman crush Wednesday"") garnered over 970,000 views and thousands of comments. The moment was major for Simpson — on the show, she introduced Jewel as one of her favorite artists and called the single, which once hit number one and spent months on the Billboard charts, one of her ""all-time favorite"" songs. Jewel is not the only person who has influenced Simpson's career. She credits Dolly Parton with giving her courage in the face of failure. When Simpson publicly botched Parton's song ""9 to 5"" during a tribute to the country singer at the Kennedy Center in 2006, Parton turned it into a learning experience. ""She said, 'Honey, don't worry about it. I wrote the song and I still can't even get the lyrics right!'…"" Simpson told Forbes. ""[Parton] really just empowered me to get back on stage, and she gave me the confidence that I needed in that moment."" In fact, it's one of the most important things Simpson has learned: ""I feel like the most empowering lesson that I have learned is failure is okay sometimes. And in that we grow, and we learn from that, and there is success around the corner,"" she told Forbes. When Simpson's career later shifted from being an entertainer to a businesswoman, she sought out industry leaders for mentorship. She teamed up with co-founder of shoe and accessories company Nine West, Vince Camuto, to launch her brand in 2005. When he passed away in 2015, Simpson posted a heartfelt message to Instagram.  ""Thank you, Vince, for the humble power that has taken me everywhere. You are my mentor, my family, the creator of all my dreams. I will forever walk in your shoes…you made them,"" Simpson captioned the photo. It's been almost a decade since her last album was released and nearly 13 years since she launched her brand. So where will Simpson be in the next five to 10 years? ""I always say, I'm ready for another billion,"" she told CNBC in 2016.

There’s reportedly trouble in paradise at the Kardashian West house. Kim’s allegedly ready to divorce Kanye! What happened?  This is so sad! Kim Kardashian, 37, is reportedly at her wits end when it comes to dealing with husband Kanye West, 40. She’s struggled since Kanye’s terrifying November 2016 breakdown, and she reportedly can’t see a light at the end of the tunnel, according to an insider who spoke to Star Magazine. “Between his raging ego and mood swings, Kanye has been a total train wreck,” the insider alleged to the Star. “Kim is stressed enough raising two kids and getting ready for the baby without Kanye dragging her down. She’s tried to hang in there, but she just can’t take it anymore.”  Poor Kim! We can’t imagine how hard it must be to have a family member — especially your husband — go through such a huge health scare. Of course she’s stressed! If they’re truly divorcing, things are about to get crazy. She allegedly doesn’t want to make any moves until after their third baby, which they’re having via surrogate, is born. As the source says, she’s totally fine raising the little one as a single mother. She’s Kim effing Kardashian!  “[Their divorce] will be all-out war,” the insider told Star. Kim has reportedly asked Kanye to sign a “mid-nuptial agreement” to protect her assets. Factoring in their revenue, from Kanye’s music, the KUWTK empire, and Kim’s various deals, including KKW beauty, it could be a $1 billion divorce!  Don’t think she’s happy about this, though. “This decision is agony for her,” the source said. “She still loves Kanye, but their marriage may be over!” This is so sad, considering what we just learned from a source. Kim and Kanye were happily including daughter North West in the conversation about her new little sister, the source told us EXCLUSIVELY. If they’re truly having problems, then at least they’re putting on a united front for their little ones.  HollywoodLife.com has reached out to Kim’s rep for comment.  HollywoodLifers, do you think Kim and Kanye are really divorcing? Let us know!	0
"Ben Affleck has returned to rehab as he continues to struggle with sobriety.  Jennifer Garner drove her estranged husband to an LA area facility on Wednesday afternoon, ET has learned. The 46-year-old actor knew he needed help and Garner was there for him, a source tells ET.  Affleck revealed in March 2017 that he had completed treatment for alcoholism in order to be ""the best father I can be,"" but his history with addiction goes back much further. In fact, his experience with alcoholism began as a child, watching his own father, Timothy, battle the disease.  Affleck has opened up about his past with alcoholism from his family's cycle of addiction to his 2001 rehab stint.    1986: Parents' Divorce  ""To be honest with you, the marriage was so bad, and I remember feeling relief,"" Affleck told Barbara Walters in a 2012 interview, reflecting on his parents' divorce when he was just 12 years old.  A Timeline of Ben Affleck's Struggles With Sobriety Embed Code Restart  ""[My father] was an alcoholic... I did know that as a child. He drank a lot. My father was a -- what did they call him -- a real alcoholic. He, you know, drank all day, drank every day, and to his credit, he got sober ultimately,"" he revealed. ""He's been sober for several decades, which I think is pretty impressive.""  ""[He] turned his life around in a very laudable way,"" the actor told The Daily Mail in 2008. ""But having such serious addiction issues has a major impact -- it colors who you are and becomes a part of you.""  Though he considered his childhood difficult, Affleck said it was his friend, Matt Damon, and brother, Casey, that helped him deal with his father's alcoholism and parent's divorce.  ""I had good friends. I had Matt Damon, I had my brother, and I had a nucleus of friends that I grew up with and I had support from,"" he told Walters.    1997: Managing Sobriety With Fame  It was a close collaboration with Damon that gained them both fame after 1997's Good Will Hunting -- shortly after which a 24-year-old Affleck stopped drinking.  ""I just wanted to stop. I started regretting some things I did when I was drunk. It's funny to be obnoxious or out of control, but then it's like, 'I think I hurt that person's feelings,' 'I made a fool of myself' or 'I didn't want to kiss that girl,'"" he told a reporter in 1998. ""I have almost no inhibitions, so it's dangerous for me.""    2001: 30-Day Rehab Program  In July 2001, after a reported night of hard partying while between his high-profile relationships with Gwyneth Paltrow and Jennifer Lopez, Affleck completed a 30-day residential rehabilitation program for alcohol abuse, driven to Promises in Malibu by his friend, Charlie Sheen,People reported at the time. After news broke to the press, his publicist confirmed Affleck's rehab stay. ""Ben is a self-aware and smart man who has decided that a fuller life awaits him without alcohol,"" the rep stated. ""He is committed to traveling to a healthier road with the support of his family friends and fans.""  ""I went to rehab for being 29 and partying too much and not having a lot of boundaries and to clear my head and try to get some idea of who I wanted to be,"" Affleck told The Hollywood Reporter in 2012, declining to go into further detail. ""It was more a 'let me get myself straight,' before it became a rite of passage.""    2004: Jennifer Garner's Positive Influence  In 2004, Affleck married Daredevil co-star Jennifer Garner, who a source tells ET put a stop to Affleck's hard partying ways and helped the actor settle down.  According to the source, friends noticed a significant change in the actor after the two got together, noting that Affleck was different than with past women he had dated. He settled down with Garner's positive influence, which ""lasted for a long time"" -- until the pair's split in June 2015.  ""I think becoming a father makes you see the world differently and it’s good,"" Affleck said in a January 2017 interview with The Guardian, reflecting on his past mistak"	0

Did the power couples kiss and make up? — That’s the question after a new report claims Beyonce and JAY-Z gifted Kimye’s new baby girl with this $23k, custom-made piece of jewelry!  What does music’s most prominent power couple gift fashion’s most prominent power couple when a new baby arrives? Well, if you’re Beyonce, 36, and JAY-Z, 48, it’s a custom-made, diamond Lorraine Schwartz bracelet, worth a whooping $21,000, according to The Sun. That’s right, Kim Kardashian, 37, and Kanye West‘s third baby — who arrived on January 15 — is about to be the most decked out infant, well… ever. And, get this — Bey and JAY reportedly had the bracelet engraved with the number “3,” to signify Kimye’s third offspring.  “Beyonce and Jay could not be more pleased for them, they can’t wait to meet the little one, and have sent them this gift already,” a source told the outlet. “It shows they have all moved on from the past, and they are ‘familia’ once more.” Although all parties involved are reportedly thrilled about burying the hatchet, “Kanye is over the moon as he has always considered JAY Z his ‘big brother,’ and Beyonce has always been one of his closest friends.” Ironically, both power couples have three children each, and “it’s only a matter of time before the playdates begin,” the source added. Bey and JAY are parents to twins Sir and Rumi, who they welcomed in June 2016, and Blue Ivy, 6. Kim and Kanye are parents their daughter, North, 4, and son, Saint, 1, along with their new baby girl.  While this report indicates that JAY-Z and Kanye’s feud is over, JAY already hinted that he wanted to bury the hatchet during an interview with The New York Times back in November 2017. “But, that happens,” JAY admitted about there being tension with Ye’. JAY explained: “In the long relationship, you know, hopefully when we’re 89 we look at this six months or whatever time and we laugh at that. You know what I’m saying? There’s gonna be complications in the relationship that we have to get through. And the only way to get through that is we sit down and have a dialogue and say, ‘These are the things that I’m uncomfortable with. These are the things that are unacceptable to me. This is what I feel.’ I’m sure he feels that I’ve done things to him as well. You know what I’m saying? These are — I’m not a perfect human being by no stretch. You know.” JAY also said that he had recently spoken with Ye’ [at the time] and that they would always be good with each other. “I love Kanye. I do,” he said, adding, “It’s a complicated relationship with us.”  As you may know, JAY and Ye’s friendship took a hit back in 2016. In October of that year, Kanye went on a rant during one of his concerts where he slammed both JAY and Beyonce. He claimed their kids didn’t play together, and he revealed that there was tension between him and JAY because of a TIDAL music dispute. Ye’ even said that JAY and Beyonce didn’t even call after Kim’s 2016 Paris robbery. Just days after his rant, Kanye checked into UCLA Medical Center for an 8-9-day stay for an alleged mental breakdown.  HollywoodLifers, do you think Bey, JAY, Kim and Ye are all friends again?	0

Jenny Slate is everyone’s favorite internet BFF. The Jewish comedian, actor, and author is best known as the star of award-winning indie abortion comedy Obvious Child. Lately, she’s become a fan favorite for her character work on hit shows like Parks and Recreation, Bob’s Burgers, Hello Ladies, and Kroll Show.  Slate’s brash, no-filter style makes her one of the most memeable–not to mention relatable–celebs out there. Sure, she pals around with famous comedians and has dated super-celebrity Chris Evans, but when push comes to shove, Jenny Slate always keeps it real. Here are 11 times she’s proved that she is all of us:  1. When she accidentally dropped an f-bomb on SNL:  (Image: SNL/NBC)  Ok, so most of us will never appear on SNL, but who can’t relate to dropping an f-bomb at an inopportune time? Slate famously cursed on her very first appearance on SNL. She was unceremoniously fired from the show at the season’s end, and has called the experience “embarrassing, devastating, humiliating, a bummer of a mistake.” Years later, she’s finally come out on top. She is the underdog we all see in ourselves.  2. When she thought it was a prank that Chris Evans was into her:  (Image: Comedy Central)  Slate famously dated Hollywood heartthrob Chris Evans after the two filmed the movie Gifted together. She has admitted that originally, she didn’t think she was Captain America’s type: “Eventually, when it was like, Oh, you have these feelings for me?, I was looking around like, Is this a prank? I mean, I understand why I think I’m beautiful, but if you’ve had a certain lifestyle and I’m a very, very different type of person — I don’t want to be an experiment.”  3. And when she got over their breakup by watching You’ve Got Mail on repeat:  (Image: Obvious Child)  Slate said she wept through You’ve Got Mail “so many times it was unbelievable” during her breakup with Evans. She also took comfort in listening to Alanis Morrisette’s infamous breakup album Jagged Little Pill on repeat. Everybody knows nothing heals a broken heart like sobbing it out to your favorite romcoms and screaming “You Oughta Know” at the top of your lungs. See? All of us!  4. When she had this hilarious reaction to being told she couldn’t order a Bloody Mary before noon:  5. When she refused to grow up:  (Image: Late Night Seth Meyers)  6. When she perfectly explained what modern life is like  7. When she thought her childhood stuffed animals were alive  Slate shared this gem of an anecdote with the NY Times: “When I was little I felt that there was something alive in my stuffed animals and in this Madame Alexander doll I slept with every night named Pudding. I slept with 36 stuffed animals and they were in a specific rotation so that each could get a night sleeping next to me. I didn’t want to hurt their feelings.”  8. When she got lonely and begged one of her girlfriends to get drunk with her  (Image: Mae Whitman Instagram)  One night, Slate was sitting at a bar alone, reading a book about the Holocaust, and she felt a wave of loneliness. She immediately texted one of her BFFs, Mae Whitman (of NBC’s Parenthood): “I was just like, ‘Can you please help me? I’m so lonely.’ And she came and we got shitbombed, and I woke up the next morning and saw my headphones on my neighbor’s yard. I have no idea how they ended up there.”  9. When she admitted she feels like an imposter adult  (Image: Obvious Child)  In an essay for Lenny Letter, Slate wrote: “Listen, I often walk around feeling that I’m an impostor adult. I make a ton of mistakes, and if my feelings were a person, that person would have messy hair like a bird’s nest (there might even be birds in there), skinned knees, and crumbs in her pockets, but also vibrant powers.”  10: When she unfollowed NASA because space is just too real  (Image: Comedy Central)  When Slate made an appearance on Comedy Central’s Drunk History, she shared that she had to unfollow NASA: “I had to unfollow NASA on Instagram ‘cause it made me too c	1
"And then there were two.  In a matter of hours, Bachelor nation will watch Joelle ""JoJo"" Fletcher pick between her final two contestants, Jordan Rodgers and Robby Hayes. Each gentleman comes with his own set of controversy; Jordan, the younger brother of Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers, has been accused of cheating on his former girlfriend and of going on The Bachelorette for the fame he never found through pro football. Meanwhile, JoJo and Robby have fought over whether the former Olympic swimmer broke up with his long-term girlfriend just to sign up for the dating series.  That’s quite a lot of baggage, but nothing the Texan can’t handle. Ahead of the season 12 finale, The Hollywood Reporter spoke with JoJo about why she feels so strongly about her two athletes.  “My favorite quality about Robby is how open he is with his emotions,"" JoJo tells THR. ""How he’s able to really put himself out there and be completely vulnerable.""  She continues, “He was the first guy to tell me that he loved me and he stayed that way consistently.”  Robby told the bachelorette he loved her during their first one-on-one date in Uruguay. On their fantasy suite date last Monday, JoJo shared with the Florida man that his use of the “L-word” early on helped her open up and trust him.  Trust has been far more challenging in her relationship with Jordan. For the past few weeks, JoJo has expressed concerns with the 27-year-old, culminating in a tough conversation before their night together in the fantasy suite. JoJo grilled the former quarterback to determine if he could commit to ""forever” and admitted his instability made her “nervous.” She added, “It makes me feel that in six months you can get a phone call and be like, ‘Well, peace! I’m out.”  But both on the show and when speaking with THR, she seems to put her worries aside. “With Jordan, my favorite thing about him was his ability to put me at ease and to make me laugh and in a lot of situations where I should have been very nervous,” JoJo tells THR.  She adds, “He was one of the only guys who was able to ease that for me. We had a really great friendship, relationship, romance. There was a lot there.”  ABC’s previews of Monday night’s finale (below) show that JoJo's final decision will be an emotional one. Stay tuned for the big moment to see who JoJo picks when The Bachelorette and After the Final Rose kickoff at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC. THR will be live-blogging the event, so share your thoughts below and on Twitter with the #THRose hastag."	1
Gal Gadot proves again that she’s a real life wonder woman!  7-year-old actress Brooklyn Prince had her wish come true when she met Gadot on Saturday during the 2017 Governors Awards.  The young actress revealed in a recent interview with ET that she’s been dying to meet the Wonder Woman star. Brooklyn has an entire bucket list of starts that she would like to meet.  “I was just thinking about some of the celebrities I’ve met,” she said. “I met Gary Oldman, I met Zachary Quinto, I met Emma Roberts, I met… what’s her name? Oh, Helen Mirren! I got to meet Elle Fanning. She also added, “Star Wars and Wonder Woman just rock!”  Prince got to meet Gadot a couple of days ago at the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences’ Governors Awards in L.A. She even took to Instagram to share the exciting rendezvous adding the sweet caption “This is the life man, better than a cruise!”	1
I am grateful to bring Amy Farrah Fowler to life on the No. 1 sitcom in America. I am honored to depict a feminist who speaks her mind, who loves science and her friends and who sometimes wishes she were the hot girl.  I can relate. I’ve wished that, too.  And yet I have also experienced the upside of not being a “perfect ten.” As a proud feminist with little desire to diet, get plastic surgery or hire a personal trainer, I have almost no personal experience with men asking me to meetings in their hotel rooms. Those of us in Hollywood who don’t represent an impossible standard of beauty have the “luxury” of being overlooked and, in many cases, ignored by men in power unless we can make them money.  I still make choices every day as a 41-year-old actress that I think of as self-protecting and wise. I have decided that my sexual self is best reserved for private situations with those I am most intimate with. I dress modestly. I don’t act flirtatiously with men as a policy.  I am entirely aware that these types of choices might feel oppressive to many young feminists. Women should be able to wear whatever they want. They should be able to flirt however they want with whomever they want. Why are we the ones who have to police our behavior?  In a perfect world, women should be free to act however they want. But our world isn’t perfect. Nothing — absolutely nothing — excuses men for assaulting or abusing women. But we can’t be naïve about the culture we live in.  I believe that we can change our culture, but it won’t be something that happens overnight. We live in a society that has treated women as disposable playmates for far longer than Mr. Weinstein has been meeting ingénues in luxury hotel rooms.	1
"John Legend has gushed about his wife Chrissy Teigen in a heartfelt birthday post.  The 'Lip Sync Battle USA' co-host turned 32 on November 30, and to mark the special occasion her 38-year-old spouse shared a close-up portrait of his partner on social media and revealed he is ""so happy"" she was born.  Alongside the Instagram post, the 'Ordinary People' hitmaker - who has 19-month-old daughter Luna and are expecting their second child together - wrote: ""Happy birthday to my wonderful wife @chrissyteigen! I'm so happy you were born! You bring so much light to my life and to the lives of everyone who knows you. I love you so much! Happy Birthday!!! (sic).""  However, the model was less than impressed by her husband's tribute to her, and slammed the choice of image for the sweet post.  Chrissy quipped: ""How about a hi-res (sic)"".  But Chrissy often teases John on social media, as when the artist attended a baseball match between the Los Angeles Dodgers and Houston Astros at Dodger Stadium during the 2017 MLB World Series in October, Chrissy took to Twitter to expose him as a bandwagon fan.  She tweeted: ""*Watches baseball once* #pinotgrigio #grigioboys #chocolatecroissants #baseballfanatics (sic)""  Although Chrissy is pregnant with her second baby she has admitted she cannot wait to have another child and to expand her and John's brood for as long as she can.  Speaking previously about her family plans, the Sports Illustrated beauty said: ""I feel good, I feel good, we're still trying ... I'm going for I mean hopefully in the next few years because for me I really want to just knock 'em out. That's my dream, I want to just be pregnant kind of for the rest of my life. Not for the rest of my life, but the rest of my fertile life. So we'll see.""  And John has revealed the pair are ""working on"" adding to their family."	1

Jay-Z has opened up about fighting for his marriage to his 'soul mate' Beyonce.  The rapper, 48, who previously confessed to cheating on his wife, was asked about their relationship during an appearance on The Van Jones Show on CNN.  Asked about fighting for their relationship, he told the reporter: 'That's my soul mate. It's the person I love. You can be in love with someone, you can love someone, and if you haven't experienced love or don't understand it or you don't have the tools to move forward then you are going to have complications. Period.'  'We chose to fight for our love': Jay-Z has opened up about fighting for his marriage to his 'soul mate' Beyonce (pictured with daughter Blue Ivy in February 2017)  'You can either address or you can pretend until it blows up at some point. For us, we chose to fight for our love, for our family, to give our kids a different outcome, to break that cycle for black men and women, to see a different outcome.'  'We were never a celebrity couple,' he insisted. 'We were a couple who just happened to be celebrities.'  He added the best way to apologize was through 'changed behavior.'  'You have to acknowledge the pain. You have to let that person have their say. You have to get on the floor, get on the mattress, and you have to really work through it and really be honest no matter how many times.

In my case, like, it's deep. And then all the things happen from there: infidelity.'  Beyonce also sparked rumors he had cheated when she referenced it in the lyrics of her album, Lemonade.	0

Welcome to Taurus Season, the time in the zodiac calendar when we connect with the earth beneath our feet. Taurus is the fertility of life, the soil the grows the food we eat, the stability that comes with having resources like money and a roof over our head. Taurus is also the pleasure and sensuality that comes with living.  This Taurus Season, however, will bring a bit of a jolt. Starting May 15 the planet Uranus, after seven years in Aries, will arrive in Taurus, awakening of consciousness to element earth. Uranus in Taurus will be a revolution of value and ownership, a transformation of our relationship with food and money. On its most fundamental level, Uranus in Taurus will give us a radical new understanding of our planet and the fragile balance that everyone and everyone takes for granted.  Mars will also change signs on May 15, adding fuel to an already supercharged day. Moving into Aquarius, a sign that it will be in until August, action will now happen on a collective level. Social causes, politics, and activism will all be hot button issues. On a personal level, Mars in Aquarius will inspire us to form community and make friendships or social connection a priority. Mars’s square off with Uranus on May 16, however, may bring a jolt to this new Uranus in Taurus era.  Even though the movements of Uranus and Mars dominate the headlines for May, there are other things going on, namely a Taurus New Moon on May 15. Money, stability, and material needs are at the forefront for the coming lunar month. Additionally, with the energy of the new moon pointing to Venus in Gemini, the coming four weeks will be busy, chatty, and filled with movement.  Mercury finally switches signs, too. After two months in Aries, Mercury arrives in Taurus on May 13. Taurus is a slow and chill placement for the usually quick and agile Mercury, but we’ll be acutely aware of the value of our choices. Communication will be practical and down to earth.  Venus also changes sign, moving into Cancer on May 19. We’ll see a shift in Taurus Season after this point too, moving from the restless curiosity of Gemini to the heart and emotional connection of Cancer. Whatever is shaking up with Uranus in Taurus may now have an emotional component. And seeing how Venus will start to face off with Saturn, we may have a serious decision to make around May 26.  We end the month with a Sagittarius Full Moon, one that will highlight themes we were working on during Saturn’s visit to Sagittarius from 2015 to 2017. Themes like faith, meaning, integrity, right and wrong. Full moons bring matters to a head, but whatever does come about may touch on the spiritual and intuitive with Jupiter harmonizing with compassionate Neptune. Maybe everything is going to work out after all.  Read for your Sun and rising sign.  DATES TO NOTE: 5/6 Sun sextile Neptune; 5/7 Mercury square Pluto, Venus square Neptune; 5/8 Sun opposite Jupiter; 5/11 Sun trine Pluto; 5/12 Mercury square Mars; 5/13 Mercury in Taurus, Mercury conjunct Uranus; 5/15 New Moon 24 Taurus, Uranus in Taurus, Mars in Aquarius; 5/16 Mars square Uranus; 5/18 Mercury trine Saturn; 5/19 Venus in Cancer, Venus sextile Uranus; 5/20 Sun in Gemini, Mars sextile Chiron, Venus square Chiron; 5/22 Mercury sextile Neptune; 5/23 Mercury opposite Jupiter, Sun trine Mars; 5/25 Jupiter trine Neptune, Mercury trine Pluto; 5/26 Venus opposite Saturn; 5/29 Full Moon 8 Sagittarius, Mercury in Gemini.  Aries  March 21–April 19  Aries, did you read your horoscope last month? We had a bit of a chat — a chat about the last seven years and how your life has been in a major state of ups and downs since then. If astrology teaches us about time and our relationship with time, then the planets are like hands on the clock that move into different signs or different hours. In 2011, the planet Uranus moved into the sign of Aries for a seven year stay, pointing you to a new hour — a time of revolution, evolution, breakthrough, and awakening. Now at the 	1
    Charlie Hunnam vows his marriage was terrible.  During an interview with the Associated Press in Las Vegas March 30, the Sons of Anarchy actor recounted his hasty 1999 wedding to actress Katharine Towne, who he had met at a Dawson’s Creek audition. Listen to what he said in the video above!  “First time I was ever in Vegas I got married, which didn’t turn out that well,” Hunnam, 37, said. “I had known the girl for three weeks. We had fallen madly in love and it was the first time I had ever been in love.”  The pair decided to elope before Hunnam, then 18, had to head back home to England. “We thought, ‘What if we never see each other again? Let’s get married and then we’ll have to see each other again even if it’s just to get divorced,’” he recalled. “So we came to Vegas, but I couldn’t even get a drink so I actually didn’t think I would be able to get married.”  But anything goes in Sin City. At 2 A.M., Hunnam and Towne said “I do” in front of Silver Bell Wedding Chapel’s Reverend RJ Cotton. (They wanted to get married by Elvis but “he left the building,” joked Hunnam.)  The end result: “Three terrible years,” admitted Hunnam, whose divorce was finalized in 2002. “Three terrible, painful, expensive years. I got the cats at the end of it, so that was good. There was a small victory.”  He’s since gone on to find success in his 12-year relationship with jewelry designer Morgana McNelis. The pair reside in a $2.76 million Hollywood Hills pad that likely sees a lot of action. After all, The Lost City of Z star recently reveled he stays in shape by having tons of sex, among other activities.  “I try to do it all. I also try to make love as often as I can. That’s an important part of fitness. There’s no reason you can’t be active at 70. I want to run up mountains at that age,” Hunnam told Men’s Health. “We are supposed to be very active animals. It’s our DNA. Sweating is how I change my oil every day. I just feel happier, more positive, energized, and disciplined if I work out.”	1

Her love don't cost a thing — but that didn't stop Alex Rodriguez from splurging on Jennifer Lopez's engagement ring. The former Yankees star is ready to pop the question to his girlfriend of nearly one year, and sources reveal exclusively to Life & Style that A-Rod is pulling out all the stops on his upcoming proposal.  “A-Rod dropped $3 million on a custom 15-carat diamond engagement ring,” a source says.

Of course, they said yes.”  Despite her three prior divorces, J.Lo, 48, has never given up on the idea of marriage. “I’m not saying marrying again is out of the question — but then, nothing in my life is out of the question,"" she said in 2016. ""Everything and anything is possible. I don’t put limits on myself.”  The couple has also made it very clear that they are ready to take their relationship to the next level.

Well look at what we've got here!  We've arrived at the final four of Alpha Male Madness, but it's already a battle between just two shows, since there are two competitors remaining from Outlander and two from The 100.  This could be shaping up to be the same final two we had last year—Bob Morley vs. Sam Heughan—or we could be up for a new combo featuring Outlander's Richard Rankin or The 100's Jarod Joseph. Joseph is even new to the competition and managed to make it to the final four, so we do not count him out of a potential spot in the final two. Anything could happen!	1
As much as he admits to hating smiling, Kanye West couldn't hold back his huge grin while spending koala-ty time with his family at the zoo.  Kanye and Kim Kardashian took their little ones on a trip to the famous San Diego Zoo on Thursday and Kim made sure to document all the adorable moments on her Instagram.  The Kardashian-Wests even got up close and personal with the animals as North got to feed an elephant a piece of lettuce before posing for the cutest photo op.  The 4-year-old also got to pose with a hippopotamus.  While North and Saint captured some scrapbook-worthy memories, there was no sign of their 11-week-old daughter, Chicago West.	1

    Drama all around! The Sunday, January 21, episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians saw more friction between Kourtney Kardashian and Scott Disick and it also featured a brief but chilling moment as Kris Jenner sat down with old friend Faye Resnick to discuss O.J. Simpson‘s upcoming parole.  The author of the controversial book Nicole Brown Simpson: The Private Diary of a Life Interrupted, said that the Juice’s upcoming parole, “Scares the death out of me.” Kris’ longtime pal, who wrote the book in 1994 after Simpson’s ex-wife and Ron Goldman were murdered, added, “I’ve been having nightmares about that.”  Kris — whose late husband, Robert Kardashian, was a friend of Simpson’s and served as his defense attorney during his 1995 murder trial — admitted to being “in denial” about what was, at the time, his upcoming parole hearing.  Kourtney Tells Scott About Her New Boyfriend  Later, Kourtney vented to sister Khloé Kardashian about a recent phone call she’d had with Scott. After he called her at 2 a.m., Kourtney revealed she told Scott, “I have a boyfriend. He’s 24 years old.” Kourtney, who met beau Younes Bendjima in late 2016, said that Scott immediately hung up on her. Kourtney shrugged, “I just thought he knew.”  Kourtney Says Scott Is ‘On’ Something  Scott seemed to fly off the handle a bit after Kourtney’s relationship status update. After recapping a heated interaction with Scott, Kourtney told Khloé that she asked him what he was “on” and told her sister that he said “f–king everything.” She then said he behaved aggressively toward her after she visited his house to see if he was all right.  The duo clearly patched things up by the end of the episode as Scott arrived at Kourtney’s to pick up son Mason, 8, for a sleepover. After putting an entire carton of milk in his backpack, the father of three left, saying, “Love you, partner” to Kourtney on his way out.  Kris Says She’s ‘Definitely Getting Into Heaven’  The episode also followed Kris exploring the option of having your cremated ashes pressed into a memorial diamond. After debating the idea with several of her children, she decided against the complicated and morbid jewelry plan. While contemplating the choice she revealed to the camera, “I believe that I’m definitely getting into heaven.”  Keeping Up With the Kardashians airs on E! Sundays at 10 p.m. E.T.	0
    Hilary Duff’s baby-to-be could be named Cafont Croissant – if it was up to her son, Luca.  “We’re up for any kind of suggestions, but Luca thinks Cafont Croissant is, like, the coolest name,” the Younger actress, 30, joked during The Late Late Show with James Corden on Monday, June 11.  “When I just refer it as ‘Cafont,’ and I’m like, ‘That would be so cool, nobody at school’s gonna be named Cafont.’ He’s like, ‘Croissant. Cafont Croissant,’” she added. “It, like, goes together, there’s no separating the two.”  Duff announced on June 8 that she and boyfriend Matthew Koma are expecting their first child together, a baby girl. She shares Luca, 6, with ex-husband Mike Comrie.  “The beginning was a little… he was surprised, and now he’s warming up to the idea,” Duff said of Luca on Monday night. “I think it’s a girl, but he told his friends at school the other day that he’s having a sister that’s part red-butt monkey, so we’ll see. We never know.”  The former Disney star finalized their divorce in 2016, more than two years after their initial split. She and Koma began dating in January 2017. They split that March, but reconciled months later.  “I think [if] you have history and a past with someone and love — and just because it doesn’t work out the first time, the second time, as long as there’s not too much damage done — then, it can always work out again,” she told The Talk late last year.	1
Miranda Lambert is currently dating Evan Felker – a married man – and her ex Blake Shelton is apparently thrilled that everyone finally knows she is a homewrecker. Even though rumors are swirling he is ready to wed Gwen Stefani, Shelton has been throwing shade at Lambert online. And, according to industry insiders, the feud between the country superstars is escalating. But, Lambert isn’t going to quietly put up with Shelton’s attacks anymore.  After the news of Lambert’s new relationship broke, Shelton posted a cryptic tweet about karma, and sources say it was exactly what everyone thought it was – a direct shot at Lambert. And, it appears that The Voice coach is getting a lot of joy out of Lambert’s embarrassment because for him this is personal.  @blakeshelton #countrymusicfreakstour gx A post shared by Gwen Stefani (@gwenstefani) on Mar 14, 2018 at 3:28pm PDT  “Blake is reveling in Miranda’s humiliation now that she’s been accused of having an affair with a married man because he believes she cheated on him,” claims the insider.  Even though they have been apart for three years, sources say the feud continues between Shelton and Lambert, and he believes that she will never change. The 41-year-old believes in the “once a cheater always a cheater” theory.  The Hollywood Gossip is reporting that Shelton thinks that his ex is the same person she has always been and that includes her “twisted relationship antics.”  The country community basically sided with Shelton after the split, but he apparently feels like he came off as the villain. Reports claimed that he filed for divorce back in 2015 and she came home to find all of her things outside of their Oklahoma house. Because of that, many made him out to be the bad guy. But, even though he feels Lambert “played the victim,” he thought he had a good reason to send Lambert packing.  Now, Shelton thinks the Tin Man singer is getting exactly what she deserves, and if she is embarrassed about the allegations that she ran off with another woman’s husband, then it is “sweet justice.”  Miranda Lambert's Ex Says She Cheated With Blake Shelton (via @Fox411) https://t.co/Xy5a8tjtkJ — TMZ (@TMZ) May 1, 2018  However, calling it justice may be a bit much, considering the fact that Shelton admitted to falling in love with Lambert while he was still married to his first wife. One source even calls him a “hypocrite.”  Lambert still denies that she ever cheated on Shelton, and she also doesn’t believe she had anything to do with the breakup of Felker’s marriage. So, she won’t be sitting around and taking Shelton’s jabs much longer. Insiders say it is only a matter of time before she retaliates and return fire.  Advertisement  Sources say that the divorce deeply shook both Miranda Lambert and Blake Shelton and it doesn’t appear either one will ever get over it. They will apparently be “trading insults, put-downs, and breakup songs for a long time to come.”	0
"UPDATE: LFO tweeted an update, saying, ""Devin's surgery went very well. Thx 4 the ❤️ & 🙏🏻! More info soon.""  Devin Lima underwent surgery on Thursday to remove a massive benign tumor.

Olivia Munn. Photo: Alberto E. Rodriguez/Getty Images  The upcoming Ocean’s 8 will reportedly have a number of big-name cameos from celebrities such as Anna Wintour, Kim Kardashian, and this cool dog riding a skateboard. But for some, the opportunity to appear in the all-female reboot of the Ocean’s Trilogy came with a cost. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly Radio, JoJo Fletcher’s once-almost-sister-in-law Olivia Munn said that she had to pay for her own makeup and wardrobe in the film’s Met Gala scene:  They’re like, “Do your own glam,” and I got the dress and all that and then you submit the bills for it because I’m part of your movie. And then [the producers are] like, “Oh no, the bills come right back to you.”  Regardless, Munn said she is “just as excited … as everybody else” for the film’s release in June 2018.  While it is unclear just how much Munn paid for her appearance, no price seems too high for the chance to appear onscreen alongside legends such as Cate Blanchett, Rihanna, and Skateboard Dog.	1

"They announced their on-again, off-again relationship was officially back on in late April.  And now it seems like Katy Perry might be contemplating a move to London to be closer to her boyfriend Orlando Bloom, according to a new report from UsWeekly.  Though they already both have homes in Los Angeles - hers is in Hollywood while his is in Malibu - the two have been spending time together in England recently.  On the move? It seems like Katy Perry might be contemplating a move to London to be closer to her boyfriend Orlando Bloom; seen in London on Thursday  And Us sources say they look even happier in his home town.  On Thursday the 33-year-old singer was spotted in the English capital grabbing dinner with her 41-year-old actor beau after she attended his play, Killer Joe.  'Katy and Orlando looked like any normal couple during dinner,' a restaurant-goer at Annabel's told the site. 'She had a huge smile on her face the whole time.'  The I Kissed a Girl singer was between legs of her world tour and jetted off to the United Kingdom to visit her Lord of the Rings star lover.  Quick bite: The 33-year-old singer was spotted last Thursday night in the English capital grabbing dinner with her 41-year-old actor beau after she attended his play, Killer Joe  The source went on to add that other diners, 'noticed she was so in love with him by the way she looked at him.'  And also remarked, 'Orlando was cracking her up.'  The couple first started dating back in January of 2016, but split in February of the following year.  Around town: The couple sat down for a bite at the recently opened, 'too beautiful to fail' Annabel's and onlookers couldn't help themselves from remarking on their amore  All of that seems to be in the past now, however, as the Roar singer has been seen frequently jetting off to London since they got back together.  Katy is now back on her world tour in support of her most recent album Witness.  On Wednesday, she is set to play a show in Johannesburg, follwed by two more concerts in South Africa's most-populous city on Friday and Saturday.

She talked about her love for music and how the mixed success of her album Witness made her reevaluate things.  'Music is my first love and I think it was the universe saying: ""Okay, you speak all of this language about self-love and authenticity, but we are going to put you through another test and take away any kind of validating ""blankie.""  '""Then we’ll see how much you do truly love yourself."" That brokenness, plus me opening up to a greater, higher power and reconnecting with divinity, gave me a wholeness I never had.  She also gave fans a small relationship update with Blasberg relaying: 'For the record, her and Orlando are good, thanks.'"	0
"'The Sandlot' cast reunites on the baseball diamond for 25th anniversary  The cast of The Sandlot reunited on the baseball diamond Thursday, 25 years after the iconic coming-of-age movie landed in theaters, and the kids are all grown up.  The gang got back together on the Today Show for a reunion celebrating the milestone anniversary of the classic film about a group of kids spending the summer playing baseball and getting into mischief.  The reunion included Tom Guiry (Scotty Smalls), Patrick Renna (Hamilton ""Ham"" Porter), Chauncey Leopardi (Michael ""Squints"" Palledorous), Marty York (Alan ""Yeah-Yeah"" McClennan), Brandon Quinton Adams (Kenny DeNunez), Victor DiMattia (Timmy Timmons), Grant Gelt (Bertram Grover Weeks), and Shane Obedzinski (Tommy ""Repeat"" Timmons).  Missing from the reunion was Mike Vitar, who played Benny ""The Jet"" Rodriguez in the movie, but director, writer and narrator David Mickey Evans joined the guys on the mound.  ""It's been crazy,"" York says to reporter Gadi Schwartz. ""I mean, it definitely gets you in places for free. I can't walk through a Las Vegas casino without someone yelling 'Yeah-Yeah!'""  Released in 1993, The Sandlot was set in 1962 and followed the summer of a group of neighborhood kids who played a never-ending baseball game and went head-to-head with the legend of a dog named ""The Beast."" The film became impactful for successful future athletes and was even recreated by the New York Yankees, who paid homage to the unforgettable Babe Ruth scene in the movie.  ""The film was made with the same amount of love that people have for it, and it was the greatest summer of our lives,"" Evans says.  ""It made a big impact on a lot of people's lives,"" Guiry says.

"Jennifer Lawrence is peak Jennifer Lawrence during interviews. Ever since her Hunger Games days she's been known to deliver an A-plus soundbite (or seven) during them. And her recent chat with Ellen DeGeneres was no exception. The Red Sparrow actress stopped by The Ellen Show on Friday (March 2) and wound up telling everyone about her drunk alter-ego named Gail.  ""I can't go on a vacation right now, because I just can't deal with 'Gail' at the moment,"" she said. ""I need to rest before 'Gail.'""  So who is ""Gail,"" exactly? Well, according to Lawrence, she comes out only during ""a very specific drunk"" period. ""It's not just every time I'm drunk, I turn into this 'Gail,'"" she said. ""I think she's some sort of like tortoise gambler, or something. I don't always turn into this masculine alter-ego that jumps into shark-ridden waters just to make my friends laugh."" That's a true story, by the way: Lawrence—or shall we say Gail?—actually did jump into shark-infested waters while on vacation. ""My friends were like, 'That's too far, Jen, like no. Not funny.'""  Lawrence suggested it's rum that really makes Gail come out, so of course DeGeneres gave her some to drink during their chat. ""I'm normally, like, pretty cautious,"" Lawrence said. ""And then I get some rum in me and I'm like, 'Let's arm wrestle!'""  DeGeneres then pulled up a picture of Gail, who was smiling at the camera in a very particular way Lawrence couldn't re-create sober. Incredible. ""I was trying to look cute,"" she said. ""I was, like, getting photographed with all my girlfriends on the beach. I wanted to look cute!… My whole face is just crooked…. The hair, too, just so presidential.""  Watch Lawrence explain all this yourself, below.  I now want to kick back with both Jennifer Lawrence and Gail at the same time. How can I make that happen?"	1

Born and raised in the Philippines, Lea Salonga grew up watching Disney movies and listening to Disney storybook tapes. Never did she imagine, though, that she would grow up to be a real-life, bona fide Disney Princess.  Then, after earning a Tony Award for her portrayal of Kim in the Broadway musical “Miss Saigon” in 1991, Salonga landed the career break of a lifetime: to be the singing voice of Princess Jasmine in the 1992 hit Disney film “Aladdin.”  Six years later, she got a second chance to live her young girl’s dream as she performed the vocals of Mulan in the 1998 Disney film of that name.  “I never thought when I was 5 and listening to ‘Cinderella’ stories that I’d be a Disney princess. I think it’s such a magical thing to happen in my life, and for it to happen twice is something I would never have thought could happen,” said Salonga in a recent phone interview.  Salonga’s distinctive voice will return to Southern California for concerts tonight at the Valley Performing Arts Center in Northridge and Saturday at Segerstrom Center for the Arts. Backed by a four-piece band, Salonga will perform a selection of well-known songs, including her greatest hits from her various musicals and films.  “We made sure to choose a fun program that the band is going to dig playing and I’m going to love singing,” said Salonga, “and because we are having so much fun onstage, I hope that translates to the audience as well.”  Salonga is keeping the program’s song selections a secret for now, until she and her musical director decide on the set list; however, she promises all of the tunes will be familiar and fit her vocal range. Some of the songs, she added, will be making their California debut.  “This will be the first time for California audiences to hear these songs, but there is nothing unknown or out of left field; stuff that always makes sense with my voice.”  A regular feature of Salonga’s solo concerts is an audience participation segment, in which she chooses someone to join her onstage to sing the Grammy and Academy Award-winning duet “A Whole New World” from “Aladdin.”  “No need to panic; we always have a lyric sheet so anyone who dares to come up doesn’t have to have it memorized fully,” she said. “I want them to have fun.”  Salonga has numerous Broadway credits, including her role as Eponine in the 1993 “Les Misérables” Broadway run and as Fantine in the 2006 Broadway revival. She recently came off Broadway in the new musical “Allegiance,” which also starred George Takei and Telly Leung.  Splitting her time between the U.S. and Manila, Salonga is a coach on the Philippine version of the television show “The Voice.” In addition to her onscreen and onstage career, she has released several solo albums, including “I’d Like to Teach the World to Sing” (1997) and “By Heart” (1999).  On this tour, Grammy-nominated bass player Trey Henry and drummer Ray Brinker, both from the jazz group Tierney Sutton Band, will back Salonga.  “I get to go up onstage with musicians who I really admire and respect, and just have a great time with,” Salonga said. “It’s thrilling when I get to perform stuff where I can just emotionally let go and fly off to another world in my mind, and the audience gets to ride on that too.”  Contact the writer: jmoe@ocregister.com	1
"Your life just got exponentially better and more stylish now you've signed up for our newsletter. Fabulousness awaits!  Keep the tea coming! Kim Kardashian is on the cover of Vogue India looking flawless as usual. However, it's the shade from the KUWTK star that has fans buzzing. Kim took the time to share what she hates most about each of her siblings — and she did not hold back.  In her defense, she does start off by listing the traits she loves about her family, including Rob Kardashian's sense of humor, Khloé Kardashian's ""I-don’tgive-a-f--k attitude,"" and Kendall Jenner's sweetness. Then things quickly go left.  A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Feb 26, 2018 at 7:35pm PST  ""Maybe… Kourtney [Kardashian]’s stubbornness. And Khloé’s getting too sensitive,"" she told the magazine of her siblings' flaws. ""I would take away Kendall’s anxiety, Kylie’s ‘I don’t care, I know what I’m doing’ thing and probably my brother’s moodiness.” The only family member exempt from Kim's critique was momager Kris Jenner, who the reality star deemed ""perfect.""  Pettiness aside, this is the seventh time Kim has graced a Vogue cover and she revealed she hoped to return to the Asian country with cameras. ""The saris, the jewelry, the clothes — everything was so beautiful,"" she added. ""I told my show that we have to figure out how to get to India."" This does not mean everyone was happy to see Kim on the cover. She did receive some backlash after fans called out the magazine for not featuring an Indian beauty.  Last year, her sister Kendall faced similar criticism and Vogue India defended it's decision to feature the model. ""In the last 10 years, Vogue India has had only 12 international covers, including Kendall Jenner in 2017,"" the magazine said in a statement. ""Therefore, statistically, 90% of our covers are Indian! And we are proud of that. India has given the world so many beautiful faces to admire. After all, we are Vogue, an international brand, and we want to give the love back by featuring some of the best international celebrities on our covers. Occasionally!""  In more important news, Kim also just shared the first photo of Chicago West on her Instagram page — and fans were freaking out. ""Wow! She is your twin,"" one fan wrote before another added, ""Two beauties... baby Chicago is her mommy's twin."" Kim just keeps winning.

"Shakira kicks off the North American leg of Her El Dorado World Tour at United Center on Aug. 3, 2018 in Chicago.  Shakira fans waited long enough to see the Colombian superstar touring and back onstage in the United States -- seven years to be exact. And for some fans, like Joel and Karen, it was the first time they got to see Shakira live.  “We drove eight hours from Minnesota just to see her,” said the couple. “We’ve been waiting since the '90s to see Shakira. I want to sing the oldies with her."" ""I’ve been practicing in my shower for the last 20 years,” added Karen.  After a successful run in Europe earlier this summer, Shakira kicked off the U.S. leg of her El Dorado Tour at the United Center in Chicago on Friday (Aug. 3). The tour was rescheduled from January after the singer/songwriter had to postpone her international trek due to strained vocal chords.  “It’s so good to see you,” Shakira said after singing her first couple of songs, including “Estoy Aquí,” “She Wolf” and “Si Te Vas.”  “It’s been way too long,"" she continued. ""I’ve been dreaming about this moment. There were times when all of this seemed impossible, but miracles do exist. You made this happen! Thank you for all your support, especially in these last few months.""  Not only did Shakira sing her heart out -- in English and Spanish -- for nearly two hours and delivered classics like “Inevitable,” “Tú” and “Antología” and her most recent hits such as “Me Enamoré” and “Chantaje,” she also danced all night long. Even as mother of two, those hips still don’t lie.  Working the stage from left to right and walking along a runway that stretched to the center of the venue, the hypnotizing and infectious hip moves came when the chart-topping artist sang tracks like “Perro Fiel,” “Dare (La La La),” “Waka Waka” and “Loca.”  Of course, the sexy, upbeat tracks called for a change in wardrobe and for those, Shakira appeared onstage with her staple belly dancing wraps covered with beads and coins that really accentuated her hip-swiveling moves.  Two special guests spotted in the crowd were Shakira’s sons: Milan and Sasha. The two almost stole the show when they were ushered to their front row seats where they would see their mamá in all her glory. From the stage and throughout the show, she blew kisses their way.  Another fan favorite moment was when Shakira appeared on the other side of the venue wearing a long, gold dress to sing “Toneladas” and right after, made her way back to the main stage walking in the middle of the crowd and stopping to snap a few selfies and greet fans who threw themselves at her as she passed by.  The grand finale was a succession of hits, including “Rabiosa,” “Hips Don’t Lie,” “La Tortura” and “La Bicicleta.” It reminded us of how vast Shakira's catalog is, and how enduring the hits are, even after a seven-year wait.  “First night in the U.S., incredible,” she wrote on social media immediately after the concert. “Thank you, Chicago.”"	1
"NBC's 'Will & Grace' cast on what's changed, and their TWO new seasons  BEVERLY HILLS — Will & Grace & Karen & Jack are back, and NBC has them.  After an eight-year run and an 11-year absence, the groundbreaking hit sitcom returns to NBC for a 16-episode run on Sept. 28, and a second, 13-episode season announced at the Television Critics Association Thursday. And it returns with its original stars — Eric McCormack, Debra Messing, Megan Mullally and Sean Hayes — and creators Max Mutchnick and David Kohan.  If you saw the original series finale, you may remember that it ended with Will and Grace happily partnered — Will with Vince, Grace with Leo — and raising children. Well, when the show returns, the partners and the children will be forgotten.  ""That was more or less a fantasy,"" Kohan says. ""It was a projection into the future. ... What we missed was the dynamic between the four of them more than we missed the possibility of seeing what they were like as parents.""  Adds Mutchnick, ""We never would have gone in that direction if we weren't ending the show.""  MORE: What to expect from your favorite TV shows  When Will first aired, NBC asked the writers to stress the friendships among the characters and downplay the fact that two of them, Will and Jack, were gay.  That's all changed, says McCormack. ""Now the message is 'we are us,' and we represent a lot of people in the country, gay and straight, and we're not apologizing for who we are.""  It can be hard to try to recapture past glories, but Hayes says the cast immediately fell back into their old groove. ""We've all become brothers and sisters and family. Moving forward with the show, it fits like a glove.""  ""When we sat down together, it just came to life in ways I'd never seen before or since,"" says Messing. ""I think of comedy as music, and each one of us is a different instrument. And when we play together, we're at our best.""  The only difference in the way they play now, says Mullally, is that they have to stretch to warm up before they do the physical comedy — something they didn't have to do when they were 11 years younger.  There's another difference: Hayes, who was in the closet when Will originally aired, is now out. While he says he wishes he had come out earlier, he just wasn't ready.  ""At the time, I didn't have the DNA to speak for a whole community. I didn't have the words to do that, and I wish I did. But now I find that words come easier.""  The world, of course, is a far different place than it was in the '90s, and Mutchnick says the show will reflect what is happening in America today, in politics and otherwise. ""The show has always been relevant,"" says Hayes. ""And under the umbrella of relevancy is everything.""  So, are they worried about committing to a second season before the first even airs? No way, says Messing.  ""We all got together and read, and it felt like coming home. For the last year, it's been a confusing time, and I haven't laughed a lot. To come back together and to laugh out loud? .. It's a no brainer.""  Adds Hayes: ""There's nothing to fear. We've been playing these characters. I play him at the Grove every time I go shopping."""	1

The former '30 Rock' star and Donald Trump impersonator reveals the actors he hates (Harrison Ford) and loves (Tina Fey), how he almost died from a drug overdose in the 1980s and the surprising roles he liked the best.  Alec Baldwin is one of the most recognizable and now, with his Donald Trump impersonation, one of the most beloved actors in America. He originated the role of Jack Ryan in The Hunt for Red October (1990) and had an iconic seven-year run as Jack Donaghy on the sitcom 30 Rock. He’s hosted Saturday Night Live more times than anyone else (17) and has been a tabloid target for his acrimonious divorce from Kim Basinger and angry outbursts at his own daughter and at the paparazzi following him around.  Now in Nevertheless (Harper, available today), Baldwin, 59, tells his story for the first time, from his Long Island childhood to his early stardom (and trouble with drugs) to his current renaissance. From the revelations about his drug use to the actors and directors he hates (Harrison Ford, Oliver Stone) and loves (Tina Fey, of course), here are the 10 most interesting things to learn in the book:  1. He’s a lot more like Donald Trump than he lets on.  Not in their politics, of course; Baldwin is as much an old-school liberal Democrat as you’ll find. And not in their humanity, either. For all his faults — and they are many — Baldwin is ultimately a much kinder, decent, more humane person than Trump, if for no other reason than the actor is pretty self-aware about his flaws and genuinely contrite for some of his worst behavior (like that infamous 2007 screaming voicemail left for daughter Ireland). But in other ways, ways that I suspect helps Baldwin play Trump, they are similar. Both are men of great appetites (figuratively speaking). The people they love, they really love. The people they hate, they really hate. Both are easy to anger. Both hold grudges for a long time (see below about Ford and ex-wife Basinger as evidence). Both have daddy issues, trying to live up to what they imagine are the expectations of their larger-than-life fathers (Fred Trump the developer, Alex Baldwin, Jr. the beloved history teacher). And both are homebodies deeply shaped by their New York youth (Queens for Trump, Long Island for Baldwin).  2. He almost killed himself with drugs and booze in the 1980s.  In the first blush of fame in the early '80s, Baldwin became addicted to cocaine and booze and almost died of an overdose while shooting a Knots Landing episode in Oregon, ending up in the hospital for 36 hours. His first crack at AA didn’t stick and he relapsed at the end of 1984. The second try stuck and Baldwin has been sober since Feb. 23, 1985.  3. He’s still angry at Kim Basinger, but sorry about that voicemail.  Baldwin’s 1993 marriage to the actress devolved into an acrimonious divorce in 2002 and a continuing custody battle over daughter Ireland. He’s still bitter about it and her role in 2007 in leaking the infamous angry voicemail where he called Ireland a pig, among other things. But he’s contrite about the voicemail itself. He writes that his relationship with Ireland has healed, but the incident “permanently harmed” their bond.  4. He doesn’t like Harrison Ford.  One of Baldwin’s breakout movie roles was as Jack Ryan in Hunt for Red October, but when it came time to negotiate a deal for the sequel, he learned the studio was talking to Ford to replace him behind his back. Hunt for Red October director John McTiernan asked Ford if backstabbing Baldwin bothered him. Ford's reply? “F— him.” Baldwin writes, “He was playing a different game. In the need of the next franchise to keep the flame of his stardom burning bright while earning him tens of millions more, what choice did he have? The carpenter who walked onto a set [Star Wars] and then into movie history knew that these roles were his legacy.”  5. ...or Oliver Stone.  Baldwin made Talk Radio with the director and does not mince words about how much he disliked the 1988 exp	1
"""We join the rest of the country in sending heartfelt thoughts and prayers to all those affected by this tragedy,"" Warner Bros. said in a statement.  In the wake of the mass shooting in Las Vegas, Warner Bros. Pictures, Sony Pictures and Alcon Entertainment have canceled the red carpet for Tuesday's premiere screening of Blade Runner 2049.  ""We join the rest of the country in sending heartfelt thoughts and prayers to all those affected by this tragedy,"" the companies said Monday in a joint statement.  Open Road Films has also canceled the red-carpet premiere it had planned to hold Monday night for its new movie Marshall, Reginald Hudlin’s film about the young Thurgood Marshall starring Chadwick Boseman.  The premiere was set to take place at the Chinese Theatre in Hollywood, but citing “this day of national mourning,” the event’s organizers have decided to forego any press coverage and instead have turned the event into a private screening.  “On this day of national mourning, we have decided to cancel tonight’s scheduled red carpet premiere of Marshall,” said a spokesman for Open Road. “Instead, tonight's event will be a private screening of the film for the cast, filmmakers and invited guests. Our thoughts are with the victims of the tragedy in Las Vegas, their families and all of those affected.”  Marshall, which opens Oct. 13, focuses on the early career of Marshall — who would be named a Supreme Court justice in 1967 — when he was a young trial lawyer.  The film also stars Sterling K. Brown, Josh Gad and Kate Hudson.  Oct. 2, 3:35 p.m. Updated to include canceled event for Blade Runner 2049."	1

Selena Gomez had to walk away from Justin Bieber when he couldn’t promise her a serious future that included marriage. We’ve got the EXCLUSIVE details.  Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber‘s latest go at love seemed so promising. They’re both much more mature and have come so far since their days of teenage love in the past. At 25, Selena was hoping that Justin could start thinking about a serious commitment in their future — marriage — but the Biebs, 24, wasn’t willing to go there yet. “He loved her very much and still does and she still has strong feelings for him. But he wasn’t ready to settle down with her as soon as she wanted to and she couldn’t get him to actually think about marriage in a serious nature,” a source close to Justin tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.  Selena underwent a life saving kidney transplant in the summer of 2017. That seemed to make her realize that Justin was worth giving another chance as by late October, she broke up with boyfriend of 10 months The Weeknd, 28, and was back in the “Sorry” singer’s arms. “Selena’s priorities drastically changed after her surgery and her perspective on life has shifted. She was looking to settle down sooner than Justin wanted to and she took his reluctance as the last straw to finally move on from him,” our insider adds.  Sel has fans thinking that she still has Bieber on the brain with the release of her new song “Back To You” on May 10. Its her first single in 2018 and her first new music since her make up and break up with Justin. It included lyrics such as “Let a couple years water down how I’m feeling about you” and “Everybody knows we got unfinished business,” which Selenators immediately assumed was about Justin. The chorus went “What was there wasn’t sure. But I’d go back to you. I know I’d go back to you.” Well, she won’t go back Justin unless he’s ready to think about putting a ring on it!

The final post-it note during Taylor Swift’s trial simply says it all.  In case you missed it or were living under a rock for the past week when the 27-year old went to trial against former Denver DJ David Mueller, employees of Craftsy working in the office last week began putting up post-it not messages in support of the singer.  It began with “Free Tay” and continued down the line with messages from her songs, such as “Haterz gonna hate” and “Are we out of the woods yet?”  https://twitter.com/TSwiftNZ/status/896353599969611777?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&ref_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eonline.com%2Fnews%2F873517%2Fthe-final-taylor-swift-post-it-message-says-it-all  While every message was powerful, we have to give props to the Craftsy girls for the final one, which read “Begin Again”. This is the message that speaks louder than words. Swift went away with winning her $1 but there’s more to it than that. This is a new chapter for Swift and for every person she fought for in the courtroom.  Who knows what might come after this. Maybe it’s new music (we hope!) or maybe it gives Swift a greater and more personal reason to give back. Whatever this chapter may hold for Swift, we are thankful that we were able to be a part of watching such a victorious and inspiring moment.  After dealing with this situation for four years now, we all can move on and look forward to the future. We are out of the woods because justice was served in a powerful way. Now, we can sit back, relax, and watch life “Begin Again”.	1
Taylor Swift’s “Reputation” tour stopped in Massachusetts this past weekend to play a three-night set in Gillette Stadium, and most of the buzz surrounding the concerts had to do with a few of her more famous fans (Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively were seen dancing, while Gigi Hadid just lost her fan-girl mind). But there were hundreds of other fans in the stadium over the weekend who didn’t get the same attention but probably should have.  So, Swift gave hundreds of free tickets to local police officers and firefighters following the tragic death of Weymouth Sgt. Michael Chesna, who was shot and killed on July 15. The Patriot Ledger reported that Swift sent the town “a significant number of tickets” to her concert. And it was a hard ticket to get.  “The gesture was absolutely generous, significant and appreciated,” Weymouth Mayor Robert Hedlund told the Ledger, adding that Swift didn’t do it for the press. Sure enough, Swift’s camp hasn’t said anything about the gesture when asked by the local media.  “My understanding is that they did it low-key and weren’t looking for publicity,” Hedlund said. “There were enough to send every police officer, firefighter and extended family to the concert, and then some.”  It’s a classy gesture by Swift for a grieving community and a great way to honor the men and women who serve.  Plus, as an added bonus, it meant that if she got stuck up in a basket again there were fans who work in law enforcement there to help her. Maybe one of those fire trucks with the really big ladder.  Now, we just have to try and find out if anybody has video of the police officers and firefighters freaking out like Hadid. I mean, really Gigi…  Then again, it was a pretty big deal: Swift is the first female to ever play Gillette.  “Getting to play here 1 time is insane. Getting to play here twice is insane. This is our 3rd night in a row playing at Gillette Stadium. Because of you, you’ve made tonight the very 1st time a female artist has played 3 nights at Gillette Stadium.” –@taylorswift13 — Gillette Stadium (@GilletteStadium) July 29, 2018  Congrats T-Swift.

"Did Charlie Hunnam really get booed at the airport by other travelers when using his celebrity status to cut the long immigration line? That's what one tabloid is reporting, but this was more than likely a false rumor.  The gossip magazine, Star, reported that the Sons of Anarchy alum caused a scene and was even booed by other passengers. A person, who is called a ""spy"" by the tabloid, claimed to be at the airport during the incident.  “The lines were huge, and people had been waiting for well over an hour, but Charlie was in and out of there at warp speed. It was as if he expected everyone to be OK with it because of who he is,"" the ""spy"" told Star.  The insider went on to say “there were a lot of snarky comments” from other travelers and ""then people actually started booing him.”  Given that the source was referred to as a ""spy,"" it's likely that this story isn't completely true. According to Gossip Cop, the report is entirely fabricated.  A source told Gossip Cop that this alleged incident ""never happened.""  When the British actor isn't the subject of seemingly fake news stories, he is gushing over his longtime girlfriend, Morgana McNelis.  While attending the Toronto International Film Festival to promote his new film, Papillon, Hunnam explained how he and McNelis have maintained their romance for more than a decade.  “I try to keep the romance on the reg,'” he told PEOPLE magazine. “I’ve been with my girlfriend 11 years, and as anyone knows, it’s been a long-term, fully monogamous relationship that requires work, a lot of work.”  Hunnam says that working on his relationship with McNelis doesn't always require grand romantic gestures.  “Before I came away to TIFF I ended up staying until 5 in the morning because I decided I was going to clean the entire house,"" he said."	0
Nicole Kidman Leaving Keith Urban-Met With Lawyer Katie Holmes Used In Tom Cruise Divorce?  “ Nicole Kidman Leaving Keith Urban- Met With Lawyer Katie Holmes Used In Tom Cruise Divorce ”?:‘ Nicole Kidman ’ did not meet with lawyer who represented Katie Holmes in her divorce from Tom Cruise, despite a false tabloid report claiming the actress is ready to leave her husband ‘ Keith Urban ’. Gossip Cop can unleash this statement exclusively. A representative of the actress tells us it’s made.  According to Women’s Day, the actress recently met with Jonathan Wolfe, the high profile lawyer who helped Holmes get custody of his daughter Suri in 2012. The so-called “source” tells the magazine that Kidman has not officially requested divorce papers. Of Wolfe, but she consulted with him “to know where she was” should decide to end her marriage.  “ Nicole Kidman Leaving Keith Urban- Met With Lawyer Katie Holmes ”?:The store’s questionable source says, “ Nicole ” was extremely impressed with how Katie’s divorce and custody battle was handled, and she really liked Jonathan. She feels confident that he could help her win, no matter how unpleasant she may be. “The supposed person said that the couple’s friends are” expecting them to be able to solve “their problems, but a separation may be on the horizon.  “ Nicole Kidman Leaving Keith Urban ”?: The unreliable tabloid hides behind an anonymous informant, but Kidman’s spokesman tells Gossip Cop that there is no truth in the story. We’re told the couple’s marriage is strong. It is also important to note, the publication never bothered to mention the implications of Kidman and Urban’s alleged marital problems. They are said to “fight constantly,” but the seemingly imaginary source gives no further details.  Last month, People published an article detailing “Kidman” and ‘ Urban’s’ “secrets to a healthy and enduring relationship.” The story was based on a handful of recent interviews in which the 12-year-old spouses talked about maintaining a strong bond. Just three weeks ago, for example, Urban talked about his wife and children during a SXWS panel.	0
"Acne is common during pregnancy but after announcing she is expecting her first child, the former Suits actress’ skin appeared more gorgeous than ever. Doctor Ross Perry, skin care expert and owner of skin clinics chain Cosmedics, told Express.co.uk that in order to get Meghan’s constant glowing complexion there are several hacks you can follow. Mr Perry said: “Do regular steams at home, exfoliate a couple of times a week, drink vast amounts of water to keep skin hydrated and wear a sun protection factor at all times. “This will help avoid pigmentation on the face.  “Stick to a healthy diet of leafy greens packed full of antioxidants, fruit and veg.” However, the skin expert pointed out that in order to sport an utterly flawless skin like Meghan did on her wedding day, “several months of perfecting are involved”. Mr Perry explained: “Meghan would have started a skin regime months ahead, specifically designed to improve the skin’s health from within, such as laser, microdermabrasion or skin peels. “We also know she had regular bespoke facials.  Meghan Markle manages to keep her skin radiant and glowing at all times  After announcing she is pregnant, the former Suits actress’ skin appered more gorgeous than ever  “Skin peels can promote collagen production and stimulate cell renewal, tightening the skin and promoting a more even skin tone with a natural glow.” The doctor also believes Princess Eugenie was as dedicated to her skin routine as her new cousin-in-law, estimating she followed “a seven step programme for at least six months”. The skin care expert suggested Eugenie sported what is called a “glass skin” on her wedding day, which is “the Korean beauty technique that involves creating a gleaming, porcelain-like effect on the skin”. But Mr Perry warned: “Unfortunately It's not something you get overnight – it's consistent skincare over a number of months which gives you that refined texture and involves double cleansing and the seven skin method.  Meghan sported an utterly perfect skin at her wedding, but months of ""perfecting were involved""  Eugenie sported what is called a “glass skin” on her wedding day"	1

"When Oprah Winfrey wants to eat something, she can order a meal made with the finest ingredients prepared by the world's best chefs.  That's all well and good, but sometimes you need a pal like Ava DuVernay, who directed Winfrey in the upcoming movie ""A Wrinkle in Time."" The Academy Award-nominated director recently took it upon herself to keep the TV queen in the loop when it comes to foods that the common folks eat.  Oprah Winfrey and Ava DuVernay in Hollywood on Feb. 25. Getty Images  Which is how Winfrey came to taste her very first Auntie Anne's pretzel!  Trending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service  ""One of my favorite things in our friendship is to teach her normal poor people [things],"" DuVernay recently told E! News. ""Like, if you're not a billionaire.""  She explained that one day she was visiting Winfrey and shared an Auntie Anne's pretzel with her. ""She's [Oprah] like, 'Oh my gosh, this is incredible! What chef? What bakery?'"" recalled the director. ""And I said, 'It's called Auntie Anne's pretzels. It's just in the mall or the airport.""  Just a small selection of Auntie Anne's goodness. Shutterstock  New York Magazine's The Cut was on the case with this last fall, noting that the pretzel Winfrey tasted was most likely wrapped around a hot dog.  Auntie Anne's does create some amazingly soft, buttery pretzels. The company, which has been around since 1988 and is based in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, now has over 600 locations around the globe.  But of course, they're not exactly a health food. As a Weight Watchers investor and spokeswoman, Winfrey has recently gotten into the comfort food business by putting a healthy spin on some classic dishes with her O, That's Good! food line — so we don't think she's been eating Auntie Anne's everyday.  Auntie Anne's now has the Oprah seal of approval. Shutterstock  But back to the delightful pretzel discovery! Having bit into her first one, Winfrey then had other questions, like, there are pretzel stands at the airport?  As DuVernay recalled, laughing, ""She's like, 'The airport?' and I'm like, 'So regular people have to walk through an airport to get to the flight usually.""  That's one way to keep her grounded!

Those are Gwendoline Christie and Maisie Williams’s stunt doubles at work there, and at least one of them makes another appearance in the video. Though I wasn’t foolish enough to think that Williams had done every single step of this fight herself, I was surprised to see her double execute one of the showstopping moves: a flip followed by an elaborate sword flourish. Thanks to some seamless C.G.I. work on the double’s face, I thought for sure that was Williams executing the move on screen.  There’s precedence for Williams (who, remember, was a dancer and gymnast before she was an actress) doing her own stunts. She took a 14-foot leap off a balcony for that foot chase with the Waif in Season 6. So it wasn’t a complete stretch to imagine she might have been able to pull this move off. But Williams has also always been very generous about her stunt doubles, reserving specific praise for the woman who was hired on last year whom she called “fit” a “trooper” and “incredible.” Though that wasn’t always the case: “I’ve had stunt doubles before where—they were lovely girls—but they didn’t look like me,” she told TVLine in 2016. “I didn’t buy it. Like, I don’t look at you from behind and think that you look like me. And that means the audience is gonna be the same. They’re gonna be like, ‘That’s not Arya!’ And instead of watching a fight scene like, ‘Oh my gosh girl, get up! Get up!,’ you’re going to be going, ‘That wasn’t even Maisie!’”  Williams doesn’t name her double in that or any other interview, nor is it easy to find her name online. Williams was also disinclined to point out specifically which moves, other than that balcony leap, she executed herself in Season 6. This is likely all part of Thrones wanting to keep the mystery alive. But now that they’ve pulled back the curtain on who did what in this particular fight, it’s worth praising Williams (and Christie) for one very specific piece of fancy foot and hand work. The final grapple, which includes a lightning-quick flip of the dagger for Arya, appears to have been all them.  Here’s hoping we see even more training for the Northern women—perhaps involving little Lady Mormont?—in Season 8.	1
Advertisement  After teasing behind-the-scenes images from the London photoshoot this July, the 2018 Pirelli Calendar has made its debut — and it's just getting curiouser and curiouser.  This year, the hotly-anticipated calendar by the Pirelli company, which has been published annually since 1963, features a whimsical Alice in Wonderland theme — and, for the first time ever, and all-black cast of subjects.  Photographed by Tim Walker and styled by new British Vogue editor Edward Enninful, each page depicts another fantastical scene from the beloved Lewis Carroll book, with actors, models, rappers, and even activists stepping into the fictional roles.  Scroll down for video  Fish-eye effect: Diddy and Naomi Campbell play the two Royal Beheaders in the Alice-In-Wonderland-themed 2018 Pirelli calendar, but look much more like they are starring in a '90s hip-hop video  Down the rabbit hole: The calendar has an all-black cast, with model Duckie Thot taking on a starring role as Alice  The royals: RuPaul plays the Queen of Hearts and Blood Diamond star Djimon Hounsou plays the King of Hearts  More royals: Whoopi Goldberg and albino model-lawyer Thando Hopa stand in as the Royal Duchess and Princess of Hearts  Taking her role seriously: Campbell looked glamorously threatening as she posed as one of the Royal Beheaders  Duo: Diddy and the supermodel looked positively regal during their joint photo shoot as the Royal Beheaders  Having a disagreement? Campbell at one point curled her left hand into a fist, suggesting the Royal Beheaders might not see eye to eye on everything  Milestone: The model and Diddy are part of the first all-black cast to have starred in a Pirelli calendar since 1987  Model Duckie Thot plays Alice herself, posing upside-down with her feet on the ceiling in a too-small house after downing the magical Eat Me cookie.  RuPaul is the Queen of Hearts. looking fabulous and menacing in a red dress while the King of Hearts (played by Blood Diamond star Djimon Hounsou) stands nearby. In another shot, RuPaul presides over a royal court, clearly not one to be messed with.  Naomi Campbell and Sean 'Diddy' Combs take on the roles of the Royal Beheaders, looking nearly indistinguishable from a pair of stars in a late-90s rap video save for the axes in their hands.  'That bold statement by Pirelli, I think, really goes against any ignorance,' Diddy said. 'People of color all over the world need to know that they're kings and queens, and I think that story of Alice in Wonderland puts that in that proper perspective.'  And Whoopi Goldberg and albino model-lawyer Thando Hopa stand in as the Royal Duchess and Princess of Hearts, respectively.  'When you think of the Pirelli calendar, I'm not the face that comes up,' Whoopi said. 'I know that. But girls, little girls like me wait to see someone who looks like me in a calendar. So, ta-dah!'  Rounding out the cast are model Slick Woods as the Mad Hatter, Oscar winner Lupita Nyong'o as the Dormouse, American Honey actress Sasha Lane as the Mad March Hare, stylist Zoe Bedeaux as the Caterpillar, women's right activist Jaha Dukurehas the Wonderland Princess, model Adut Akech as the Quene of diamonds, rapper Lil Yachty as the Queen's Guard, and model and activist Adwoa Aboah as Tweedledee.

"Professional peers and musical collaborators as well as close friends, Chester Bennington and Chris Cornell shared a bond beyond the stage — and one that has taken on a poignant weight in the wake of Bennington's apparent suicide on what would have been Cornell's 53rd birthday.  While the duo didn't work together often, they shared the stage when Cornell toured with Bennington's band Linkin Park in 2007 — and again the following year, when Cornell and Linkin Park headed up the Projekt Revolution package tour. As Cornell told Rolling Stone at the time, one of the joys of being on the road with the band was watching Bennington's intense dedication as a performer.  ""When we toured Australia, Chester broke his wrist on like, the third song and then finished the whole set with a broken wrist,"" recalled Cornell. ""That kind of dedication and passion, like, 'This is what I'm doing, this is the most important thing there is, I'm onstage right now.' That affects me.""  ""I'm such a fan I think that's the most important aspect of why I do what I do and how I do it. I've got to play with a lot of guys that I've grown up loving; I get to sing on stage with Chris Cornell,"" added Bennington. ""I'm just like, 'What world do I live in? 'Cause this can't be real.'""  The two frontmen shared a fondness for similarly dynamic approaches to music, but they had personal similarities, too — not least their separate struggles with addiction, which they'd both discussed openly in an effort to help others. In the wake of Cornell's passing earlier this year, his family and fans speculated regarding the role prescription medication may have played in his suicide; given the close similarities between Cornell and Bennington's deaths, similar questions are likely to follow Bennington's passing.  Whatever led to Bennington's death, it's clear he was profoundly shaken when Cornell ended his life. In an open letter posted after the news of Cornell's death broke, Bennington wrote that he woke up with the Beatles' ""Rocky Raccoon"" in his head the morning he heard the news, and wondered whether it was a subconscious or supernatural reflection of Cornell's absence.  ""I’m still weeping, with sadness, as well as gratitude for having shared some very special moments with you and your beautiful family. You have inspired me in many ways you could never have known. Your talent was pure and unrivaled. Your voice was joy and pain, anger and forgiveness, love and heartache all wrapped up into one. I suppose that’s what we all are,"" wrote Bennington. ""You helped me understand that. I just watched a video of you singing ‘A Day in the Life' by the Beatles and thought of my dream. I’d like to think you were saying goodbye in your own way. I can’t imagine a world without you in it. I pray you find peace in the next life. I send my love to your wife and children, friends and family. Thank you for allowing me to be a part of your life.""  Looking back on the days after Cornell's death, Bennington's fellow Linkin Park co-founder Mike Shinoda recalled the band's performance of its new song ""One More Light"" — a song he described as being ""about the loss of a friend"" — in tribute to Cornell. Although it wasn't being promoted as the single from their latest LP, and Bennington ""just couldn't finish the song"" when they played it, Shinoda reaffirmed the value of its message — now more than ever.  ""One of the things I think you can do is reach out to people and offer them community, let them know we’re a family, we’re community, we care about each other,"" said Shinoda. ""Whether a friend who lost somebody, a family member or whatever, to reach out and let them know even that you’re thinking about them, sometimes that’s enough.""

The Perfect Little Bump  Margot Tenenbaum, now 21 weeks pregnant. (Photograph by Katherine Wolkoff)  Manhattan, of course, has long been proudly gaunt, inhabited as it is by legions of celebrities, socialites, fashionistas, and those who would be them (remember Edith Wharton’s ethereal creatures, Lily Bart of the long, light step and the slender pink nails? Slender nails?). Only in the past few years, however, have the bump, the basketball, and the belly on two sticks entered the local lexicon. Blooming stars now strut the red carpet at the Oscars and pregnant supermodels flaunt their exposed bellies, while Us Weekly, People, and the Star intrepidly report on who has stayed admirably attenuated (Gwyneth Paltrow, Sarah Jessica Parker) and who has not (Debra Messing, Kate Hudson). In late spring, the hot gossip swirled around paparazzi shots of Paltrow emerging smilingly (triumphantly?) svelte from a London hospital. The conspiracy theory was that she hid out in the hospital for a few weeks after giving birththere’s just no way she could’ve lost so much weight so quickly. The pregnant-celeb watch is about to reach a new peak this fall, as Julia Roberts waddlesshe’s having twins; she can’t help ittoward a January due date. Toss into this roiling mix the Atkins and South Beach dietsthe latest devotionals in New York’s Church of Divine Diminishmentand you’ve got a freshly minted group neurosis. You’ve also got an unnerving question: Are women starving their babies by starving themselves?  W ay back when, in the late fifties, a woman as tortured as Sylvia Plath could be at her sunniest when she was cow-heavy and floral. Today, the prevailing attitude toward the extra flesh of maternity verges on disgust. A sampling of what women tell me they do not want to be while pregnant: a fat slob, a huge blob, sloppy, horrible like Kate Hudson, fucking gross. Tenenbaum’s language is less harsh (mushy is her preferred pejorative), but she has the same fear of becoming almost offensive, of not measuring up. She keeps worrying, she says, about an upcoming vacation with her husband’s family. There’s no way she wants to expose her girth in a bathing suit, but then she wonders if they’ll think she’s ashamed of her body if she swims in shorts and a shirt. And maybe I am ashamed, she says.  Berger sympathizes. The last time I got weighed [at the OB’s], I was really pleased the nurse just wrote the number in my chart and didn’t say it out loud, because it was so . . . If you knew how much I weighed, you’d be like, Oh, my God!’   In conversations with several dozen more pregnant women and new mothers, I was repeatedly struck by how fixated they are on the new pregnancy ideal, how much they lap up the praise if they achieve it, how anxious they are if they don’t. It’s a jungle out there, and only the scrawniest survive.  Beth Dorfman, a second-trimester periodontist, was so concerned about blowing up, and about eating healthy in general, that she consulted nutritionist Tanya Zuckerbrot early in her pregnancy (Zuckerbrot says she’s seen a significant increase in the number of women who come to her for weight-related reasons). I remember shopping with my mother and I thought, These random people walking past me on the street, I wonder if they think Hmm, that girl might be pregnant, or That girl might just have eaten seventeen cupcakes an hour ago, ’  Dorfman says.  Zuckerbrot advised Dorfman to eat more protein and fiber (pregnant women can go Atkins, by the way, as long as they eat some carbs) and turned her onto the miracle that is Scandinavian fiber crisps. They’re like sixteen calories a cracker, Dorfman says. They’re not the tastiesta nice bagel or bread would taste betterbut they satisfy some of the craving and fill me up. Dorfman promptly began eating three of the Scandinavian crisps topped with peanut butter and jelly for breakfast. Even her peanut butter is diet, she says. It’s not Skippy Reduced	0

Martin Scorcese made a short film that got him a movie. When I met Alexander Payne, he first showed me a short film. It is the greatest voice for emerging filmmakers and it’s given me the wisdom to work with the director many, many times,” said Laura Dern, the newest judge of the Moët Moment Film Festival, which kicked off its annual competition with a cocktail party at West Hollywood hot spot Poppy.  Joining Dern was her Star Wars: The Last Jedi costar and fellow Film Festival judge, Billie Lourd, in a glittering Gucci dress, as well as actor Jon Tenney with producer Leslie Urdang, and actress Jamie Chung, who created the signature cocktail for Sunday’s Golden Globes, the Moët 75. “I love tequila, I love Champagne. I love the two and why not mix them?” Chung explained, wearing a flapper-inspired frock. “The undertones of fruit [from the orange juice] complement the Champagne, and I love tequila because it gives you a kick.” Lourd seemed to agree, saying, “I’m a mimosa gal, with a brunch,” before quickly adding, “but not too many because then you have to nap!”	1
STYLISH power couple David and Victoria Beckham turned heads at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle’s A-list nuptials.  But Becks made more of a statement than Posh — his fashion designer wife — when dressing for the elegant affair.  The former soccer star’s suit held a special significance as it was the first official design seen publicly from new Dior Homme artistic director, Kim Jones.  And Victoria’s mid-length navy frock, however, raised eyebrows for the wrong reasons.  A statement from Dior to News Corp Australia described Becks’ ensemble in depth as “a Dior Homme charcoal grey super 130’s wool twill morning coat and pants”.  RELATED: INSIDE ROYALS’ BOOZY AFTER-PARTY  RELATED: MEGHAN FLASHES DIANA’S RING  The French luxury house went on to say, in detail, that Beckham’s outfit also included a “light grey super 150’s wool twill double-breasted waistcoat, a white 200/2 Egyptian cotton poplin shirt, a grey silk satin tie, a grey silk satin pocket square and derbies in black calfskin leather”.  It gained the seal of approval from style bible Vogue, which described Beckham’s suit as “dapper” and “modern”.  What’s the point in even existing when David Beckham looks like that. #tidy — Rory Douglas-Speed (@RorySpeed) May 20, 2018  When you’re walking down the aisle to marry Prince Harry but you spot David Beckham looking like a snack in the stalls pic.twitter.com/uXB4CW5C70 — Ruby Fitzmaurice (@rubyfitzmaurice) May 20, 2018  The three-piece suit also showed off Beckham’s extensive hand and neck tatts, and was teamed with a neat pocket square and gold chain attached to a button on his vest.  British designer Jones — the former head of Louis Vuitton — will show his first collection for Dior Homme at Paris men’s fashion week next month.  GQ noted that Beckham’s suit signalled a departure from the usual Dior Homme look, suggesting Becks’ suit and tie “didn’t look like Dior Homme — at least as we’ve seen it in recent years”.  While Becks’ outfit went down well on social media seeing him labelled the best dressed bloke out of all the guests, Posh’s didn’t fare so well.  She was slammed for her “miserable” facial expressions as well as her choice of familiar-looking frock.

Posh’s name had been mentioned in a string of rumours speculating who would design Meghan Markle’s wedding dress and after-party outfit.  Givenchy, of course, ended up creating the newly-named Duchess of Sussex’s wedding gown, while Stella McCartney designed a custom evening dress for the reception.	1
Dr. Evil is back and he’s running for public office!  On Monday night’s Tonight Show, host Jimmy Fallon began a segment stating that, on the eve of the midterm elections, one candidate is on hand to present their case for why they deserve Americans' votes. That’s when he presented Mike Myers’ hilariously insidious character from the Austin Powers films.  “Yes, Jimmy,” he replied when asked about his (not at all real) congressional candidacy. “Haven’t you been reading the news? It’s 2018. Evil’s in right now. It’s hip. It’s like playing Fortnite while slamming a Tide pod and doing the Shiggy Challenge.”  When the late-night host admitted that he had no idea Dr. Evil wanted to run for office, he answered that he initially was after Brett Kavanaugh’s seat on the Supreme Court but claimed that President Donald Trump called him “too even-tempered” for the gig.  Later, Dr. Evil shared his campaign slogan: “Make America Evil Again.” He did this by presenting a red ball cap featuring the line. Obviously, this a nod to Trump’s often-derided campaign slogan, “Make America Great Again.”  So, what is Dr. Evil’s platform? If elected, the only flavor of Pringles will be Screaming’ Dill Pickle (and the can will be narrower for eating un-ease). Donald Trump Jr. will be named Secretary of the Treasury, purely because Dr. Evil wants to poke him in the tummy, like the Pillsbury Doughboy. He also wants to increase the length of time required before skipping a YouTube ad from five seconds to eight seconds. Lastly, he also intends to legalize marijuana and make the kids song “Baby Shark” the national anthem.  Dr. Evil finished by performed the infectious song, despite Fallon's pleas that he stop.  Check out the entire incredible chat in the clip above.

The story of young Mary Queen of Scots is coming to an end. The upcoming fourth season of the CW’s costume drama Reign will be its last. The CW brass have made the decision and have informed the series’ producers.  Reign, from CBS TV Studios, is in production. The cancellation news comes just as the series is starting filming the Season 4 finale. That is the same timing as the CW’s decision to end 90210 three years ago. However, in the case of Reign, I hear that the call did not come out of the blue. I hear the network and the producers had been having conversations that Season 4 may be the last, so the writers had been crafting this as a possible final chapter. Word is that they are prepared to shoot a series closer, and the show will be able to give fans a conclusion to the story of Mary Queen of Scots, which was not the case with 90210.  Primetime-Panic Your Complete Guide to Pilots and Straight-to-Series orders See All  The 16-episode final fourth season of Reign premieres on Feb 10, with the period drama occupying the Friday 9 PM slot. Its last episode is expected to air in June.  Reign is one of two female-centered CW dramas certain to end this season, along with The Vampire Diaries. Created by Laurie McCarthy and Stephanie SenGupta, Reign stars Adelaide Kane as Mary, Queen of Scots.    	1
Audrina Patridge files for divorce, obtains restraining order against Corey Bohan  After just 10 months of marriage, Audrina Patridge is splitting with her husband Corey Bohan.  The former Hills star filed for divorce from Bohan this week and obtained a domestic violence restraining order against him, according to People and the Los Angeles Times.

Dolly Parton, Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda are ready to punch the clock once again as a sequel to their 1980 comedy 9 to 5 is in the works. According to Entertainment Weekly, Fonda revealed plans for the trio to team up for a modern revival.  “My role is as an executive producer, and I’m working with the writers, with Lily, and talking to the writers,” Fonda told reporters at the Television Critics Association panel. “Right now, Dolly, Lily and I are all intending to be in it.”  The film, said Fonda, will tackle current issues in the workplace like changing technology and corporate voyeurism.  “I’m sorry to say the situation is worse today,” she said. “Today a lot of the workforce is hired by an outside company. Who do you talk to if you have a problem?”  Rumors of a remake swirled earlier this year when it was revealed that Rashida Jones and the original screenwriter, Patricia Resnick, teamed up to co-write a script. At the time, Parton was eager to reprise her role for a follow-up film.  “All these years we’ve talked about doing a sequel to 9 to 5 and it never made any real sense until just recently,” Parton said to Entertainment Weekly previously. “We decided that we are going to do another one. We are trying to get the script and all that, everyone is very interested and we’ve all agreed that we’d love to do it if it’s right.”  Added Parton, “I told them we better get after it or it’s going to be 95 instead of 9 to 5.”  No word on when production for 9 to 5 will begin for Parton, but in the meantime, the Tennessee native has her hands full with several major projects. In addition to acting, Parton’s production company, Dixie Pixie Productions, has teamed up with Warner Bros. Television and Netflix to create eight original films based on her music. The films are set to air on Netflix in 2019.	1
CBS late-night star Stephen Colbert will guest on Jimmy Kimmel’s ABC late-night show on Thursday. Colbert, whose show broadcasts from New York, will be in Los Angeles, appearing in promotion of his first-ever gig as hosting CBS’ broadcast of the Primetime Emmy Awards that Sunday night. Last year’s Emmy Awards host Kimmel no doubt will have some advice for him.

Colbert is appearing one night after Kimmel plays host to former White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer, who is making his late-night debut.	1
The family of Robert Hardy has paid tribute to the “gruff, elegant, twinkly, and always dignified” actor, who has died at the age of 91.  Hardy was best known for his role in the Harry Potter films as the Minister for Magic Cornelius Fudge, and as Siegfried Farnon in BBC series All Creatures Great and Small.  Hardy’s children Emma, Justine and Paul said in a statement: “It is with great sadness that the family of Robert Hardy CBE today announced his death, following a tremendous life: a giant career in theatre, television and film spanning more than 70 years.  “From the early start, post WWII, with the Shakespeare Memorial Company in Stratford, to his later role in the Harry Potter films as Cornelius Fudge, the Minister for Magic — he will perhaps be most remembered for two iconic roles: as Siegfried Farnon in the long-running and much loved BBC series All Creatures Great and Small, and in his many and magnificently distinguished portrayals of Winston Churchill. ”  They said that they will remember their father “as a meticulous linguist, a fine artist, a lover of music and a champion of literature, as well a highly respected historian, and a leading specialist on the longbow.  “He was an essential part of the team that raised the great Tudor warship The Mary Rose.  ‘Always dignified’  “Gruff, elegant, twinkly, and always dignified, he is celebrated by all who knew him and loved him, and everyone who enjoyed his work.”  Hardy’s children said they are “immensely grateful” to the team at the Denville Hall retirement home for their “tender care” during in the weeks before his death.  A familiar face in households across the country, Hardy’s other roles included Tite Barnacle in Little Dorrit (2008) and Arthur Brooke in Middlemarch (1994).  He also took on the leading role in Churchill: 100 Days That Saved Britain (2015) and in Winston Churchill: The Wilderness Years (1981).  One of his earliest TV jobs, in 1955, saw him take on Shakespeare as he portrayed Cassio in Othello.  The Bafta-nominated star, from Cheltenham in Gloucestershire, was also awarded a CBE for his services to acting.  Harry Potter actor Chris Rankin, who played Percy Weasley in the films, wrote on Twitter that he was “terribly sad” to hear the news of Hardy’s death.  He said: “He was a very kind man who told wonderful stories.”  London’s Westminster Abbey shared a tribute on Twitter, remembering his reading from Henry V at the venue’s service marking the 600th anniversary of the Battle of Agincourt in 2015.  The British Film Institute posted: “We’re sad to hear Robert Hardy, best known for roles in the Harry Potter films & TV series All Creatures Great And Small, has died aged 91.”  Magdalen College, Hardy’s alma mater, said: “Sad news breaking that Magdalen alumnus Robert Hardy (1944) has died at the age of 91.”  The Mary Rose Museum in Portsmouth said: “This is very sad news. Robert Hardy was one of our strongest supporters, and we’re very appreciative of all the work he has done for us. RIP.”	1
1 of 14  Reality TV star Heidi Montag has shared a snap of herself breastfeeding her three-month-old in what might be the most glamorous setting ever.  In the pic the 31-year-old is reclining on a couch covered with over-stuffed cushions, baby Gunner at her breast. She's surrounded by her four toy dogs and is wearing an unbuttoned dress and an expression of deep and peaceful happiness.  Heidi captioned the image describing motherhood as 'the greatest joy and blessing in my life'.  Heidi and Spencer Pratt welcomed their first child into the world in October after more than a decade of dating. And they're clearly loving every moment - Heidi in particular.  The duo were regulars on the series The Hills, the reality TV show that followed their lives along with those of their co-stars/friends Lauren Conrad and Kristin Cavallari. Speidi, as the couple was dubbed by the tabloids, were often front and centre of the show as they kissed, broke up, kissed and, well, you know what comes next.  Heidi's many cosmetic surgeries and Spencer's bad boy behaviour meant the duo were the most loved/hated of the cast.  But whether you liked or loathed them, you couldn't help but be moved by the genuine joy they showed when they welcomed baby boy Gunner Stone into the world in October 2017.  Gunner looks set to be a reality star just like his mama and papa.  He has his very own Instagram account and while he's posted just 22 images so far, has already clocked up more than 60,000 dedicated fans.  Scroll through the following gallery of images and you'll quickly understand why. Cute or what?      Image: Instagram/@Heidipratt	1
"British Nigerian actor  John Adedayo B. Adegboyega (born 17 March 1992), known professionally as John Boyega, is an English actor known for playing Finn in the 2015 film Star Wars: The Force Awakens and its 2017 sequel Star Wars: The Last Jedi, respectively the seventh and eighth films of the Star Wars series. Boyega rose to prominence in his native United Kingdom for his role as Moses in the 2011 sci-fi comedy film Attack the Block.  Boyega's other credits include historical drama film Detroit (2017), the science fiction film Pacific Rim: Uprising (2018), four episodes of the television series 24: Live Another Day and the drama Imperial Dreams (2014). Boyega received the BAFTA Rising Star Award in 2016.  Early life  Boyega was born on 17 March 1992 in London, England, to British Nigerian parents, Abigail (née Aboderin), who works with the disabled, and Samson Adegboyega, a Pentecostal minister.[1][2] His first role was a leopard in a play at his primary school.[3][4]  Boyega was a pupil at Oliver Goldsmith Primary School. While acting in a play there at the age of nine, he was noticed by Teresa Early, the artistic director of Theatre Peckham, a learning theatre for young people who live in south London. After obtaining financial assistance from a hardship fund, he joined the theatre, spending his time there outside school hours between the ages of nine and 14. Boyega's father, a preacher, had wanted Boyega to become a preacher too, but was supportive of his son's theatrical interests.[5][6][7][8]  In 2003, Boyega started his secondary education at Westminster City School, where he took part in various school productions.[9] Between 2008 and 2010, he attended South Thames College at the college's Wandsworth campus to study for a National Diploma in Performing Arts.[10] His activities at the college included playing the title role in the college's production of Othello.[11] He enrolled at the University of Greenwich to study BA Film Studies & Media Writing,[12] but dropped out to focus on acting.[6]  Career  Boyega trained at the Identity School of Acting in Hackney,[13] and appeared in Six Parties at the National Theatre and Category B at the Tricycle Theatre prior to being offered a role in the 2011 film Attack the Block.[14][15] In September 2011, HBO announced that Boyega had been cast in the boxing drama pilot Da Brick, loosely based on Mike Tyson's life. Boyega was expected to play Donnie, who is released from a juvenile detention centre on his 18th birthday and begins to examine what it means to be a man. The pilot was written by John Ridley,[16] but was not picked up by HBO.[17] Also in 2011, he acted in the film Junkhearts in which he portrayed Jamal, a drug dealer who finds some guns and tries to sell them.  Boyega was chosen by Fionnuala Halligan of Screen International as one of the ""UK Stars of Tomorrow 2011"" and appeared alongside two other actors on the front cover of that magazine in its July 2011 edition.[18] In March 2012, Boyega was cast in the film adaptation of Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie's book Half of a Yellow Sun.[19] On 29 April 2014, it was confirmed that Boyega had been cast as a lead character in Star Wars: The Force Awakens.[20] It was later revealed Boyega would play Finn, a stormtrooper for the First Order, who leaves the military power after witnessing their cruelty in his first combat mission before joining the fight against them. The film was released on 18 December 2015. Both the film and Boyega's performance received acclaim from both audiences and critics.[21][22]  In 2017, Boyega starred in Detroit, Kathryn Bigelow's film about the 1967 Detroit riots.[23] The same year, he reprised his role as Finn in Star Wars: The Last Jedi.[24]  In January 2016, Boyega formed his own production company, Upperroom Entertainment Limited.

"Kylie Jenner named her baby Stormi, and revealed her last name  At least the Kardashians keep it... interesting?  Two weeks ago Kim Kardashian and Kanye West revealed that they named their third child, a baby girl, Chicago. Now, sister Kylie Jenner has announced the name of her baby girl with beau Travis Scott, born Feb 1: Stormi.  Jenner revealed the name on Instagram, later updating the caption to include the baby girl's last name, Webster. Scott's real name is Jacques Webster.  Twitter promptly had a field day.  Jenner's Instagram has become the most popular post on the photo sharing site, according to the Associated Press. The image of Jenner's first born has racked up more than 14.1 million ""likes"" as of Wednesday afternoon. Trailing close behind is Beyoncé's 2017 post in which she revealed she was pregnant with twins. The photo has been ""liked"" more than 11.2 million times. A family photo shared by soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo last year has amassed more than 11.3 million ""likes.""  Jenner's rep, Carrie Gordon, confirmed the baby's name to USA TODAY. .  Stormi's cousins are North, Saint and Chicago from Aunt Kim, and Dream from Uncle Rob. Aunt Kourtney provided playmates with relatively tame names by comparison: Mason, Penelope and Reign.  Can't get enough of the Kardashian-Jenners? You can see Kylie's pregnancy video here."	1

"We're still basking in the aftermath of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's engagement announcement . It was a lot to take in at once—the statement, the photo call and then their first interview together . But since most of Harry and Meghan's relationship has been kept from the spotlight, it was really nice to just see them be together.  So after watching their joint interview about seven times—where we got the proposal story and the truth behind how they met —we were thrilled to discover that there is even more footage from the chat, but it's more candid and goofier. A double treat!  They pulled faces; they joked around; Meghan made this funny face at Harry like she was pretending to interrogate him.  Basically, they laughed a lot, and it further proved that these two are made for each other.  The reporter, Mishal, said on The One Show that it was obvious Harry and Meghan are ""very much in love,"" based on ""the bond between them"" and their body language."	1

Prince Harry shared.

The beginning of fall is marked by some very specific things. The leaves change color, the temperature drops, school begins for many, and of course, a myriad of new trends inundate every fashion blog, store, and online shop. It is easy to be tempted – or overwhelmed – by all of the options. You might be wondering things like which pieces are actually worth the money, which will be out of style come 2019, and which will actually have long-term staying power in your wardrobe.  I find myself in this predicament often, now more than ever as I attempt to make my wardrobe less excessive and able to fit in a much smaller New York City closet. There are some pieces that circle back every fall like skinny jeans, trench coats, and booties. Sometimes these take on more modern interpretations, but they’re classics nonetheless.  With fall quickly approaching, we curated a list of the season’s most timeless pieces for women, the ones you will want to wear year after year. So, whether you’re trying to keep your seasonal wardrobe down to the basics or looking for some new pieces to add to your collection, this list has got you and your closet covered.  Check out 35 timeless fall fashion staples for women below:  A jacket that can handle unexpected weather  Lees ook op Business Insider Tandartsverzekering kun je vaak missen als kiespijn – een aanvullende verzekering haal je er alleen in deze gevallen wél uit  Foto: source Nordstrom  Fall promises some cool relief after a hot summer, but fall weather (especially in the northeast) can be pretty erratic. One day you’re basking in the sunlight of 60 degree weather and the next you wake up to a blizzard- this is not an exaggeration, it happened to me when I lived in Upstate New York. Getting dressed is significantly more difficult when you don’t know what weather fall will throw at you, but luckily this Barbour jacket can withstand it all. It is made with waxed-cotton, corrosion-proof zippers, and double-stitched seams to give you a weatherproof finish that is super practical, but attractive too.  A basic black cardigan  Foto: source Nordstrom  A black cardigan is the perfect item to throw-over any outfit when you need some extra warmth or to cover your shoulders. Find one that is thin enough to easily transition between seasons. This is the ultimate everyday layering piece and it comes in a variety of neutrals, so you can find one that best matches your wardrobe.  A fun blouse  Foto: source Banana Republic  You should have a few blouses that are comfortable, work-appropriate, and easy for everyday wear. This one can easily be tucked into jeans or trousers for a more casual or formal look, respectively. Polka-dots are a fun way to add pattern while still staying within a neutral color palette.  A pair of good socks  Foto: source Bloomingdales  Beneath every cute pair of boots is a good pair of socks. At least, there should be.

"Every year, it seems like there's at least one moment in The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills supertease that becomes instantly iconic — even before the season begins.  Last year, we were obsessed with finding out what drove the usually stoic Erika Girardi to tearfully say, ""You don't know what I deal with every night."" Now this year, it's a diva-licious moment from Lisa Vanderpump that drops Kyle Richards and Dorit Kemsley's jaws in the Season 8 trailer (clip above) — and it had us picking up our jaws off the floor, too.  At the end of the trailer, we see Lisa drive away in her car after saying to Kyle and Dorit, ""I'm going home to my husband who would rather spend time with me tonight than you would."" That's followed by Kyle and Dorit looking visibly shook.      Lisa revealed what was going through her mind during that moment in a recent interview with ET. “Normally I have my cool, and I kind of lost it that day,” she said. “I think on Beverly Hills, you see this wonderful, glittering existence, and you also see the struggle that the women go through.”  Kyle compared her behavior to a certain iconic TV character who's also known for her fierceness. “I was like, ‘OK, Alexis Carrington, got it,’” she told ET, comparing Lisa to the beloved Dynasty diva. “It was so out of character for her to let her guard down like that, that's why my mouth was literally hanging open.”    We have a feeling that jaw-dropping moments won't be in short supply this season of RHOBH. Check out a sneak peek of Tuesday's all-new episode at 9/8c, below."	1

    It’s a party! Jimmy Fallon kicked off Saturday Night Live on April 15 with an epic flash mob featuring Harry Styles dancing to the late David Bowie‘s “Let’s Dance.”  The Tonight Show host, 42, returned to host the NBC late-night sketch comedy show for the first time since 2013 to celebrate the first-ever episode that aired live from coast to coast. “Tonight is bigger than a show,” he said during his opening monologue. “It’s a party!”  SNL‘s house band then began playing “Let’s Dance” as Fallon walked off the stage and through the halls of the studio, surrounded by dozens of backup dancers. While he sang the 1983 tune, he was joined by the SNL cast members and the evening’s musical guest, Styles, 23.  And while the former One Direction singer only appeared for approximately 15 seconds, his charming (and funny!) dance moves and irresistible smile essentially stole the show.  Jimmy Fallon's Most Hilarious Talk Show Games  Later on, Styles performed his new single, “Sign of the Times,” and debuted a second song, “Ever Since New York,” from his upcoming debut self-titled solo album.  Saturday Night Live airs on NBC Saturdays at 11:30 p.m. ET.	1

"Say goodbye to 'House of Cards' and hello to a new Netflix era  Netflix is dead. Long live Netflix.  This weekend marks the end of an era for the omnipresent streaming service, with the debut of the final season of ""House of Cards.""  Canceling ""Cards"" and ""Orange is the New Black"" (its seventh and final season is due in 2019) officially closes the streaming service's first chapter of programming, five years after it began. It was a time when the TV sky seemed limitless – no shows seemed to get canceled, old favorites were constantly being saved and streaming was a playground for writers and directors to experiment. And always, at least on the outside, it seemed to work.  It was an era when Netflix sought a handful of high-quality, high-talent series to lure new subscribers. It was the era when the Kyle Chandler-starring ""Bloodline"" and the Wachowski sibling extravaganza ""Sense8"" were among the service's top offerings because of their pedigrees alone (both series eventually were canceled in early seasons). It was a time when we thought Netflix was just trying to become HBO.  But that was 2013. And maybe 2014 and 2015. In the week ending Nov. 2, Netflix released eight new projects, including documentaries, comedy specials and movies, more than any breathing human could likely watch in a weekend. When the Emmy nominations were announced this summer, for the first time, Netflix had more than HBO.  The streaming service has spent billions of dollars on original programming in every genre, from Food Network-style baking competitions (""Sugar Rush"") to foreign language sci-fi (""Dark"") to preteen sobfests (""Alexa and Katie""). Sure, it's still fun and experimental. But just like traditional TV networks (whose audience size is made public, unlike Netflix), the streaming service is more frequently canceling shows that don't stick, including Marvel's ""Luke Cage"" and acclaimed true-crime parody ""American Vandal.""  In this new world of Netflix, ""Cards"" and ""Orange"" seem quaintly out of date, just five years after they broke ground.  Almost from the moment it began unveiling original programming – known until then for reruns of series like ""How I Met Your Mother"" and ""Breaking Bad"" and mail-order DVDs – Netflix changed TV. It started quietly with shows like ""Lilyhammer"" but Netflix's big coming-out moment was ""Cards,"" a drama about a ruthless politician directed by Oscar nominee David Fincher and starring Kevin Spacey (then a powerhouse celebrity). It was exactly the kind of dark, serialized, twisty series that thrived in the new binge-streaming paradigm, and it became a phenomenon.  Not long after, prison dramedy ""Orange"" arrived, looking, sounding and feeling like nothing else on TV, including a cast with a wide range of races, body types, socioeconomic statuses, gender identities and sexual orientations. It told women's stories at a time in television when most other programmers were trying to find the next Walter White.  ""Cards"" and ""Orange"" were showered with Emmy nominations (though their wins were few) and became the face of the streaming frontier that Netflix set out to dominate. But the streaming service doesn't need them anymore.  Sure, both shows have declined sharply in quality, which would seemingly warrant cancellation, but the reasons for their demise go beyond just their age: Netflix now has so many other options that scratch the same itches.  More: New on Netflix in November: 'House of Cards,' 'Narcos,' and plenty of Christmas films  The service has spent hundreds of millions to woo Shonda Rhimes and Ryan Murphy from TV networks, both creators known for making shows with diverse casts and, especially Murphy, for experimenting with form. Want politics? Netflix has also signed Barack and Michelle Obama to a production deal. It has dark dramas and anti-hero shows by the dozen, from ""Ozark"" to ""The Punisher."" It won 23 Emmys this fall (tying perennial leader HBO), plus SAG Awards and Golden Globes aplenty. If you need to see its "	1
Click to email this to a friend (Opens in new window)  Click to share on Twitter (Opens in new window)  Click to share on Facebook (Opens in new window)  Christina Aguilera was infatuated with a guy who was into guys.  When discussing the inspiration behind her 2002 song “Infatuation” on “RuPaul’s Drag Race: Untucked” on Thursday, she admitted, “It was heartbreaking because I found out he played for your team, not mine.”  Aguilera, 37, didn’t reveal her muse’s name, but she previously told MTV News that the track was inspired by her ex-boyfriend, dancer Jorge Santos, whom she dated for two years.  After her split from Santos, whom she described as her “first love,” Aguilera married Jordan Bratman, from whom she split in 2010. The “Genie in a Bottle” singer is currently engaged to longtime love Matthew Rutler.  In addition to spilling the tea, Aguilera shared some advice with the aspiring drag performers.  “Once you obtain a certain level of success, you can become jaded and you can see certain people around you change,” she said. “That can make you change and feel guarded or shut down and weird. But I think as long as you keep remembering who you are as a person — and keep remembering the good and the good around you — then nothing can stop you.”	0
SPOILER ALERT: Do not read on unless you’ve seen Season 7, episode 2 of “American Horror Story,” titled “Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark,” which aired on Sept. 12.  The premiere of “American Horror Story: Cult” found Ally (Sarah Paulson) to be, well, a mess after the election. As Donald Trump is voted into office, her old phobias rear their ugly heads once again, but in the second episode of the season, “Don’t Be Afraid of the Dark,” it only gets much, much worse. In fact, her fears become fatal in the last shot of the episode, one of the most unsettling scenes yet.  But first, we pick up where we left off — with Ally in bed with one of the dreaded clowns. She screams and runs for Ivy (Alison Pill), who rushes to protect her and is as sweet and patient as ever. When she finds no such clown in the bedroom, however, despite Ally’s protests, Ivy admits again that Ally’s anxiety has taken its toll on her. Ally finally resigns to her state, saying, “I think there might be something wrong with me.” (But hey: Just because she’s paranoid, it doesn’t mean someone isn’t out to get her.)  Meanwhile, we see that Kai’s (Evan Peters) nefarious plans from the last episode have been working out swimmingly for him. After he provoked a band of construction workers by yelling racial slurs at them and chucking over a condom full of his urine, they unleashed a beatdown on him… while someone filmed on a cell phone nearby. Now it’s a local news story, and of course it takes a political turn: some of the construction workers have been taken into the custody of ICE. In announcing his run for city council — a seat that was vacated by the murder of councilman Chang — he quotes Trump’s “rapists and criminals” line, yelling, “Look at my face, Michigan!”  Speaking of the Changs, the Mayfair-Richards already have new neighbors. After a rather creepy scene where Winter (Billie Lourd) engages in the most serious pinky swear ever with Oz, vowing to take his fear for him, she allows him to go next door to play with the new residents. Ally and Ivy get home and immediately freak out over this (how have they not fired Winter yet? Seriously?) and rush over to find Oz playing with bees. Yes, in a blatant reference to the “hive mind” theme of this season, one of the new neighbors is actually a beekeeper.  And this also means that Billy Eichner and Leslie Grossman’s characters have been revealed. Harrison and Meadow are married, but not a couple — in fact, Harrison is gay. They just got married based on a pact they made when they were younger. Harrison gets one night a week to go out on the town and satisfy his needs, while Meadow, because of her past case of skin cancer, doesn’t like to be touched, so it all works out pretty nicely for them. They’re a blunt pair, which takes Ivy and Ally aback, but Harrison notes that that’s just “the way of the world now.” Indeed, Harrison.  Ally — surprise! — is skeptical of them, especially of the mysterious barrels they keep at their home, and the fact that they moved into the Chang’s old house so soon after the murders. But she’ll soon learn that they’re the least of her worries. Something’s tripped the alarm system back at their restaurant, and though Ivy offers to go, Ally insists that she can and that she’s “got this.” One has the sense, however, that she does not, in fact, got this. When she gets there, she makes a gruesome discovery: one of her restaurant’s managers hanging from a meat hook, just barely alive. As we learn later, Ally had to be the one to kill him.  Unsurprisingly, there’s an investigation, but there’s a political twist now: a worker at the restaurant is a suspect, due to an argument with the deceased that turned weirdly racial at the top of the episode. When a police officer, played by “AHS” newcomer Colton Haynes, asks Ally and Ivy about his immigration status, Ivy indignantly insists that “he’s American.” Other repercussions of the murder, of course, lie in Ally’s psyche. She gets a gun from Harrison, who has	1

"The title for the sequel to ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" was revealed today and it has ""Harry Potter"" fans going crazy with excitement.  Interested in Harry Potter? Add Harry Potter as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Harry Potter news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest  The sequel, expected to hit theaters next year, is called ""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,"" Warner Bros. announced. And the title gives clues on exactly where the second installment of this film series is headed.  ""Harry Potter"" fans already know that ""Fantastic Beasts"" is a spin-off of sorts to the famed wizarding film series.  Warner Bros. Pictures  In fact, Harry Potter studied a book written by Newt Scamander called ""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"" while he was in class at Hogwarts. The first movie follows Scamander and the magical creatures he collected and documented.  ""The Crimes of Grindelwald,"" however, is centered on Gellert Grindelwald, played by Johnny Depp, who is Albus Dumbledore's longtime rival.  In this film, the Hogwarts headmaster, portrayed by Jude Law, tries to track down Grindelwald after the wizard escapes custody. To help him in his search, Dumbledore enlists his former student and magizoologist Scamander, played by Eddie Redmayne.  Warner Bros. Pictures  Author J. K. Rowling, who wrote the screenplay for the first film, also lent her talents to ""The Crimes of Grindelwald,"" which also features Zoe Kravitz as Leta Lestrange, a pure-blood witch now engaged to Scamander's brother.  The sequel, ""Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,"" also has a special release date -- Nov. 16, 2018. It's nearly 17 years after the initial ""Harry Potter"" film, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone"" hit theaters."	1
With each passing birthday, sources tell Star magazine, Suri's heartache grows too.  'Like any little girl, her greatest wish is for her father to be there, and now she's been disappointed again,' a friend told Star.  Star's report claims the 54-year-old actor hasn't seen his daughter in 1,965 days, and has 'been absent for one milestone after another.'  They add, 'That would be painful for any child, and you have to wonder what kind of emotional toll it's taking on Suri.'  Suri celebrated her 12th birthday with mum Katie Holmes Getty  According to Star, Katie has tried to explain Tom's absence by telling Suri that her dad's crazy moviemaking schedule leaves him little time to jet back and forth for visits.  A source said, 'Now that Suri's older, that story may not fly anymore.'  Many believe Tom's inability to see his daughter is due to his fierce commitment to the Church of Scientology, which requires its members to 'disconnect' from friends and family who leave the faith.  Psychologist, Dr. Cara Gardenswartz, told Star that Tom's decision to not see his daughter would be 'psychologically devastating.'  'Suri may feel it's because she's not good enough,' Dr. Gardenswartz claims. 'A child's experience between 8 and 12 is really going to impact them as a teen and as an adult.  'They're figuring out their sexuality, as well as relationships between men and women. Not having a parent around - especially a girl missing her father - can be quite confusing.  'It's a hole that can never be filled.'	0

The day so many in the WWE Universe hoped they would see is actually upon us: Daniel Bryan is an active Superstar once more.  The fan favorite and current “SmackDown Live” general manager has been medically cleared by WWE to wrestle again — and just in time for WrestleMania 34. Bryan does not yet have an opponent for next month’s WrestleMania 34, but you better believe Vince McMahon & co. are scrambling to make that happen.  The undersized Bryan’s in-ring career was shut down two years ago following a series of concussions. Now, he’s got the thumbs-up from numerous neurologists, WWE says.  Also Read: Charlotte Flair Says Ronda Rousey Signing With WWE Raises 'Everyone's Game' (Video)  “Following more than two years of extensive evaluations, WWE Superstar Daniel Bryan has been medically cleared to return to in-ring competition by leading neurosurgeons, neurologists and concussion experts, including Dr. Robert Cantu, Dr. Javier Cárdenas and Dr. Jeffrey Kutcher,” WWE said in a statement on Tuesday. “Bryan underwent a full review of his medical history and received comprehensive neurological and physical evaluations independent of WWE. He was cleared by each doctor as well as WWE’s Medical Director, Dr. Joseph Maroon.”  Also Read: WWE 'Raw': Watch Brock Lesnar Beat the Hell Out of Roman Reigns With a Steel Chair (Video)  TheWrap spoke with Bryan last June about his battle to return to in-ring action. At the time, he was frustrated with WWE’s decision to bench him, but understood executives’ reasons from a liability aspect.  “I’m not convinced that there is anything the WWE could hear that would change their opinions. The difficulty is in the testing for concussion protocols — there’s too much liability involved,” he told us at the time. “Everybody agrees that they think my brain is fine now, right? But there’s nothing to say that if something else happens, something bad couldn’t happen.”  “So, that kind of liability when it’s a billion dollar company with lots of people who work there — they don’t want to see that happen to me, with my family. I have a new daughter,” Bryan continued. “They don’t want to see that happen where there would be a huge lawsuit. That would hurt their ability to employ as many people as they do.”  Read more from our candid interview with Bryan here.  Also Read: Triple H on Daniel Bryan's Fight to Return to WWE Ring: 'There Will Be No Exceptions'  In January, we asked WWE Superstar and executive Paul “Triple H” Levesque about Bryan’s fight to fight again. The part-time wrestler and EVP of WWE Talent told us the following:  There can be no exception medically. If the belief is that he’s not healthy enough and there’s a risk [for him] to perform, then I don’t know why you’d allow him to step into the ring unless it can be proven otherwise. There will be no exceptions. We have some of the best medical people in the world that work for us. Our wellness policy, our concussion programming, our protocols — I’ll put them up there against any on the planet. That is a new science in a way, too. So we’re gonna look at it from all aspects, but the medical experts will make the determination as to whether he can ever step into that ring or not. Look, personally for him, I know it would be something he would love to do, and part of me feels like I hope he has that opportunity. But at the same point in time, he’s married and has a child. Certainly, [we put] the human being first.
